<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 161 - Confusion</h1>
 
 Chu Shen and the gang appeared suddenly in a small dirt field. Chu Shen sighed. Another world, another disaster. Looking around he saw a small town not that far away. After pointing it out, everyone decided to go ahead and visit the town.
  
 They weren’t too far away whenever Lucas suddenly perked up. “I can see cars! Cars!” Lucas studied the town with his cybernetic eyes for a little while before sighing. “They aren’t too advanced though, it’s almost like they’re out of my history book. They still travel over the ground and judging from the smoke, they still run on fossil fuel. Disappointing.”
  
 Chu Shen patted his back. “Well, at least that means they have some form of technology.”
  
 Lucas nodded, cheered up by Chu Shen’s optimism. “That's right! Maybe they have something else to offer.” He immediately went back to staring at the town. Aslo just shook his head. They got weirder and weirder every time he saw them.
  
 “Look out!” Lucas suddenly yelled. Right as he spoke, a sonic boom rang out in front of them. A person clad in a bright red suit shot past them. The person hit the ground, causing dust to shoot up everywhere.
  
 Another person suddenly fell from the sky. He crashed into the ground, causing the earth to crack beneath his fall. Dust billowed around him, but he walked out of the new dust cloud, allowing Chu Shen and his group to see what he looked like.
 This person had on bright purple shorts with no shirt and purple face mask. His entire body was covered in muscle and he was at least seven foot tall. Painted on his chest was a purple fist.
  
 He glanced at Chu Shen’s group before dismissing them.  The man turned towards the dust cloud that had been raised by the red-suited man. “I told you Crimson Scorcher! Your fireballs aren’t a match for my pure body strength! Fairview will be my town to rule!”
  
 The dust cloud settled, revealing this ‘Crimson Scorcher.’ He coughed before standing up. The frightening crash had ripped his red suit and his left arm hung limply at his side. “Wrecker! So long as I am alive, you will never terrorize these people!”
  
 As he said that, Crimson Scorcher pointed his right hand at Wrecker. A red fireball formed in front of him before flying at Wrecker. The target in question smirked before flexing his feet. Cracks spread from around his feet as Wrecker leaped sideways. He skimmed over the ground, barely an inch above it, and avoided the fireball.
  
 “Such little tricks aren’t going to work on me Crimson Scorcher!” Wrecker yelled at the man as the fireball impotently passed him. Kicking down at the ground, he surged forward towards Crimson Scorcher.
  
 Crimson Scorcher desperately attempted to defend by sending another fireball at Wrecker. Crossing his arms in front of him, Wrecker endured the fireball and rammed into Crimson Scorcher. Grabbing him by neck he lifted Crimson Scorcher into the air. “To think you would become so weak after I merely broke your arm. I heard you elemental metas would become distracted by pain and couldn’t fight, but I didn’t think it would be this exaggerated.”
  
 Crimson Scorcher glared down at Wrecker. “If you hadn’t ambushed me in my car, none of this would have happened.”
  
 Wrecker smiled. “You’re right. Flying into the air really is effective when fighting muscle heads like me. Luckily, I still have some brains. Tactics are also a part of strength, yes? Now that the talk is over, I remember you saying I couldn’t rule Fairview while you were still alive. Taking that into consideration… you need to die!”
  
 Wrecker threw Crimson Scorcher into the ground, creating a human shaped crater. Right as he went to punch the prone figure, a hammer suddenly smashed into his back.
  
 He flew quite a distance away before landing face first. Standing up, Wrecker turned around, furious at this interruption right at this most critical part. “WHO DARES?!!!”
  
 Who? Chu Shen of course!
  
 Chu Shen stood there, his hammer standing tall beside him. Lucas glumly watched from the side. His armored suit would draw too much attention, it would be better to stay back for now. Aslo decided to just watch this time around while Chrissa joined him.
  
 Wrecker saw Chu Shen and became confused. “Kid, I don’t know what stupid idea you got into your head when you gained powers, but you ain’t a hero. Turn around and get back to town. I don’t fancy killin’ kids.”
  
 Chu Shen sighed. This bad guy talked too much! He gripped his hammer with both hands and charged towards the man. In less than a second, he appeared before Wrecker, already swinging his hammer at Wrecker’s stomach.
  
 Wrecker immediately panicked. This kid was too fast! A sonic boom could be heard as the hammer struck his gut. Wrecker folded in half as he was sent flying backwards once more. Chu Shen winced as he heard the crack of bone from when he hit him.
  
 The first time, he hadn’t put a whole lot of strength in his attack. This time, he had used fifty percent of his strength and accidentally broke this bad guy’s ribs. After going over to the Crimson Scorcher, Chu Shen pulled him from the crater. Wrecker had apparently lost consciousness and so had Crimson Scorcher.
  
 Master Ti Wu scanned Crimson Scorcher since he had already passed out. Meanwhile, Chu Shen gave Crimson Scorcher a couple light taps on the cheek. Soon, he woke up.
  
 “Whaa! What’s going on!” Crimson Scorcher started to immediately panic.
  
 “Hey, hey. Shhh. It’s all right. I already beat up that Wrecker guy. You’re OK now.”
  
 Crimson Scorcher started to cry. As he did, Master Ti Wu started to share his findings with Chu Shen. “These guys somehow awakened their abilities. Their souls can manipulate Qi, but they can’t sense their meridians. They can’t even cultivate, yet somehow, they can still manipulate the elements. I would say it’s like Aslo’s case if it weren’t for that Wrecker fellow over there. He also can’t cultivate or manipulate Qi, but he has the body of a martial artist. It’s really weird.”
  
 Chu Shen shrugged and replied mentally to Master Ti Wu, “I guess other dimensions just have different ways.”
  
 Crimson Scorcher looked up at Chu Shen after he stopped crying. “Sorry about that. I just felt so relieved. I thought I was going to die and then suddenly, I was still alive. I was just shocked.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “It’s understandable, don’t worry about it.”
  
 Crimson Scorcher cocked his head at Chu Shen. “You must be pretty powerful to have taken Wrecker out. He’s a Class 3 Strength-type Meta. However, I’ve never seen a Super use a hammer and you don’t even have a costume. Are you new to the hero business?”
  
 As Chu Shen was about to answer, a translucent shield appeared around him. Suddenly, he disappeared.
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 162 - Another World?</h1>
  
 They suddenly appeared in yet another dimension. This time they were in a clearing in a forest. Chu Shen looked around before suddenly yelling at the sky. “WHAT THE HECK! This is way too random!”
  
 Lucas nodded. “To suddenly start jumping not even ten minutes after arriving… It’s too abnormal.”
  
 Aslo shrugged. “I don’t find it odd at all.”
  
 Chu Shen turned to Aslo. “Of course you don’t. I’ve been to Lucas’ dimension, the martial dimension, your dimension, and the Nugitraaiil dimension. Every time, I always spent at least 3 months in each dimension. Now, we suddenly spent only ten minutes in one. It’s… concerning.”
  
 Lucas nodded. “It’s ver-.”
  
 As Lucas spoke, he was interrupted by a thin stream of water that shot down from the sky and sliced a hole through the ground beside them. Two giant robots flew overhead. A giant staff could be seen in the hand of one and a sword was in the hand of the other. The sword robot had a pair of wings behind it while the staff robot seemed to be floating with no propulsion unit.
  
 The robot with the staff was flying above the sword robot. The robot pointed its staff at the sword robot. Energy suddenly surged from the robot. Blue circles with some arcane text written inside them suddenly appeared behind the robot. More of them appeared every second until they started overlapping, slowly forming a hazy image.
  
 The sword robot’s wings flapped once, causing it to surge towards the staff robot. The sword glowed a bright green as energy collected along its edge. The sword robot swung its sword at the staff robot, sending a green blade of energy straight at it.
  
 A blue shield of energy flared to life around the staff robot. The green blade started to dim before vanishing. The sword robot didn’t stop though and started swinging its blade as fast as it could. Hundreds of green blades of energy filled the sky and converged on the staff robot.
  
 The blue shield cracked, and the green blades of energy made small cuts in the chassis of the staff robot, but it was too late. The circles finally stopped growing. One could now see that the circles stacked together to create a }{ symbol in the air. A surge of water gushed forth from the symbol, creating a massive wave of water in midair. The wave smashed into the sword robot, pushing it downwards.
  
 Chu Shen, who had been observing the fight at first, suddenly panicked. The two robots hadn’t moved much from their initial position, so he and his group were still right below the two robots. Consequently, the wave of water was heading straight for them!
  
 Chu Shen immediately started dashing to the side. Lucas, Aslo, and Chrissa followed suit. A few seconds later, there was a tremendous CRASH as the water stuck the ground along with the sword robot. The water smashed into the ground, causing the surface to crack and shudder. The sword robot went completely through the ground. The water surged outwards from the initial impact, surging forth towards Chu Shen.
  
 He formed his (Universe Shield: Reality). A circular shield made of gray metal appeared between Chu Shen and the wave of water. The water struck the shield and was blocked by it. It surged around and over the shield, leaving Chu Shen, who was behind the shield, completely dry.
  
 Lucas was swept away by the water and crashed into three different trees, breaking all of them in half. Aslo shot upwards on a stream of fire while Chrissa rode a cushion of air into the air, completely avoiding the wave of water.
  
 The staff robot landed on the now muddy ground. Broken trees, bits of rock, and muddy water filled with clumps of grass now covered the once pristine clearing. The aftermath of that tidal wave was quite shocking. The }{ symbol still floated behind the staff robot. Climbing out of the ground was the sword robot. Its metallic body was slightly dented, but otherwise it seemed fine.
  
 The blue circles behind the staff robot pulsed brightly before fifty streams of highly compressed water shot out of the circles. The sword robot jumped left and swung its sword at the water streams that were in its path.
  
 Several water streams struck the sword while two streams hit the robot’s body. The water streams splashed against the robot’s sword and the chassis of the robot. At first glance, it didn’t appear as though the water streams were effective. If one paid attention though, they would see the gouges where the water streams had struck the sword robot as it jumped out of the way.
  
 The staff robot twirled its staff once, causing the }{ symbol to pulse brightly. Water ropes snaked out, grabbing the sword robot. The water ropes hoisted the sword robot into air. The wings on the sword robot flapped desperately, but they were tangled up by the water ropes.
  
 A much thicker stream of water shot outwards, striking the robot in the chest. The stream of water cut into the robot at a visible pace, the metallic chassis diminishing inch by inch. The back of the robot suddenly split apart and a man in a black robe shot out. A sword was strapped to his back.
  
 The man didn’t draw his sword but instead quickly ran away from the staff robot. With a gesture of the staff, the water ropes dropped the now lifeless sword robot and shot after the robed man.
  
 The robed man leapt from tree trunk to tree trunk, dodging the water ropes skillfully. Three of the ropes ganged up on the robed man but a flash of light sliced all three ropes in half. The man jumped past the cut ropes, revealing his now drawn sword.
  
 The water ropes had previously been around the thickness of a man. Now, they split up into many smaller ropes and surrounded the robed man. They surged towards the robed man all at once. Soon the robed man was caught. As soon as he was, the back of the staff robot opened up. A man with a staff in his right hand floated out of the robot.
  
 “I told you I would win, Ah Fan!”
  
 The robed man, ‘Ah Fan’, laughed. “I didn’t doubt it for a second, Lin Bai. Mages are stronger than warriors, especially with the Magic Knights to enhance their casting power.”
  
 ‘Lin Bai’ smiled bashfully. “Thank you for letting me win this duel, Ah Fan.”
  
 Ah Fan grinned. “You’re welcome. As the winner, I think it is only fair that you take responsibility for your win and pay for the Magic Knights to be repaired.”
  
 Lin Bai groaned. “You sly dog. I really hate you, ya know that?”
  
 Ah Fan squirmed slightly, causing ripples to spread through the water ropes still binding him. “Uh, Lin Bai. Do you mind dispelling your Water Binding spell? It’s not very pleasant being tied up like this.”
  
 “Hey!” A shout distracted both Lin Bai and Ah Fan. Looking up, they saw a teenage boy descending towards them on a pillar of fire. A girl floated down beside him on a whirlwind. Aslo glared at Lin Bai when he landed next to him. “What's the big idea! You almost crushed us with that hunk of metal!”
  
 Chu Shen had also run over to the two magicians using the old-fashioned way, walking on the ground. Lin Bai looked at the three kids in front of him. “How did you get in here?! This is the private dueling grounds of the Magic Knight Association. There should be no one inside except me and Ah Fan. Don’t you know that breaking in here can get you executed?”
 
  
 Aslo paled. This may not be the best start for their adventure in a new dimension. Chu Shen raised his hands and stepped between them. “Hey now, sorry about that. We just got lost when we were exploring the Association and wound up here. Just show us the way out and we won’t complain about your fight almost squashing us.”
  
 Ah Fan chuckled. “Lin Bai, set me down and give these kids a break. Remember that when we were younger, we did a lot of foolish things too.”
  
 Lin Bai chuckled as well as he turned his attention to the water ropes. Waving his staff, the water ropes dissolved, allowing Ah Fan to fall to the ground. “I remember those things pretty fondly, Ah Fan. Anyway kids, I think we can let you this once. Just don’t do it aga-. Huh? Where’d you go?”
  
 Those kids, he had just taken his eyes off them for ten seconds and they had already vanished into thin air.

  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 163 - Blue Screen</h1>
  
 Chu Shen and his friends had, of course, disappeared from the dueling grounds. This time, they appeared on a rocky plateau. In front of them was a steep cliff and behind them was a stretch of empty rock. The sky was dark and ominous, though the sun could be seen occasionally peeking through the sky.
  
 Chu Shen didn’t have time to study his surroundings before a blue screen appeared in front of him.

 Chu Shen blinked. The blue screen stayed in front of him. What the heck was this? This had never happened to him before. Chu Shen studied the blue screen in front of him and was stunned when he realized it had every martial art he had learned under “Skills”. Lucas, Aslo, and Chrissa had similar blue appear in front of them.

 Aslo and Chrissa were also extremely confused at this. Just what was this strange thing? Lucas, however, was in shock. Wasn’t this the same kind of table that appeared in VR games? He had played them often before the accident with his parents. One of his favorites was Royal Routes Legends, an epic magic game set in a fantasy world. Those who played the game often usually called it RRL.
  
 As this thought occurred to Lucas, he attempted to dismiss the screen like he would in the game. “Dismiss.” As soon as Lucas said that, the screen disappeared. “Status.” The screen appeared in front of him again.
  
 Dismissing the screen, he looked over at Chu Shen. His face was scrunched up in confusion as he stared at the screen in front of him. Lucas went over to him and looked over his shoulder. While he could see the blue screen, no writing was visible. He couldn’t see anything besides a blank screen.
  
 “Hey Chu Shen, can you see anything?” Chu Shen turned his head to look at Lucas when he heard his voice. Unfortunately, the blue screen blocked his vision. While he could see through it, it was difficult to make anything specific out.
  
 “That you, Lucas?” Chu Shen’s voice had a questioning tone to it.
  
 Lucas laughed when he saw Chu Shen squinting at him through the status screen. “You dummy. Just say ‘dismiss’ and it’ll go away.”
 
  
 Chu Shen tried it and the blue screen disappeared. While Chu Shen was dismissing the status screen, Lucas also told Chrissa and Aslo how to get rid of their status screens.
  
 After they got rid of the screens, they studied their surroundings. Looking off the edge of the plateau, all of them were stunned at what they saw. Below them, they could see two armies clashing.
  
 The two armies were so far away that any normal human would have seen only dark blobs. Thanks to their cultivation level, and Lucas’ cyborg eyes, all of them could see the two armies with perfect clarity.
  
 Flashes of light could be seen coming from the battlefield. Energy surges continuously surged forth and mages could be seen casting spells. Fire flared to life and hurricanes formed, flinging their helpless victims around. Snowstorms appeared sporadically, freezing their targets.
  
 If that was all, then they wouldn’t have been so shocked. Lucas and Chu Shen had already seen such a sight when they first arrived at Chrissa and Aslo’s dimension. What truly shocked them was that one of the armies was clearly not human.
  
 Flying creatures wielding spears swooped downwards. Green skinned giants swung clubs at their enemies, sending them flying into the air. What really drew their attention was a man in golden armor facing a humanoid creature covered in black scales with streaks of blood red color. Jutting from the creature’s head were two horns, one pure black and the other a solid blood red.
  
 The man in golden armor had wings made of white energy. His left hand held a tower shield and his right hand held a spear. His armor combined with his wings made him seem like an angelic being descending to the mortal world.
  
 Facing him was the scaled creature. The creature had a black sword in each hand. The scaled creature had black wings and a dark energy shrouded it, making its body appear hazy and indistinct.
  
 Both of them were fighting in midair. Flying towards one another, there would be a lightning quick exchange before they would fly apart and get ready for another pass. The man raised his tower shield upwards. A beam of light shot downwards from the now visible sun. The shield glowed with a golden aura as the man shot towards the scaled creature.
  
 Blood red lightning surged from the scaled creature’s hands, striking the shield of the man. The golden aura dimmed but did not disappear as the man rammed the scaled creature. The scaled creature tumbled downwards from the air, but it managed to pull up before it hit the ground.
  
 The scaled creature’s black aura became even denser before it suddenly disappeared into the shadows. The sun had disappeared behind the clouds, casting the entire battlefield into darkness. The golden-armored man cautiously looked around, obviously attempting to locate the scaled creature.
  
 Suddenly, the man swung his sword behind him. Behind him was a tangible shadow holding a dagger, poised to plunge it into the man’s back. The sword cut through the shadow, causing it to disappear into the air. While the man was in mid-swing, the scaled creature appeared before him. Its twin swords swung forwards, cutting through the man’s neck.
  
 The man’s wings of energy disappeared. The scaled creature watched as the man fell downwards towards the earth. At first he fell slowly, but he started to pick up speed the closer he came to the ground. The man’s head slowly floated upwards from his body as he fell.
  
 The army of monsters roared as the slain man fell to the ground. The opposing army became downcast. Some of the human army started to retreat. Soon, everyone was running from the battlefield. As Chu Shen watched, the monsters did not attack the fleeing army. Instead, they started collecting their dead and the human dead.
  
 Lucas turned towards Chu Shen. “Well. You don’t see that every day.”
 
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 164 - Demon King</h1>
  
 After they saw the fight, it was unanimously decided that finding a village was their top priority. Seeing all those monsters and the mysterious blue tables made them realize that this was a completely different world than the ones they had visited before. At least there, everything was similar. Here, everything seemed completely foreign.
  
 Using (Stars Dance: Light Step), Chu Shen carried Lucas into the sky. From there, Lucas was able to use his telescopic vision to find a town close by. Large stone walls surrounded the town. The soldiers that had retreated could be seen flowing into the town through the large iron gate.
  
 They quickly decided against going to that town since it seemed as though it would facing an invasion soon. Instead, they decided to go to a town a mile away from that one. It was about half the size of the first one and had a wooden wall made from logs around it.
  
 Once they had chosen their destination, Chu Shen and his friends quickly departed for the town. At first they were only walking. However, Lucas saw that the monster army was starting to march towards the stone-walled village. Upon seeing that, they decided to hurry to the village they chose, since they weren’t sure if it would be caught up in the fight.
  
 In about ten minutes they saw the village. Two anxious guards could be seen standing on a hidden walkway. Their lower bodies were below the wooden wall, but their upper bodies were visible from the shoulders up. Below the two guards was a large copper door that was currently closed.
  
 When the guards saw them, the one on the left immediately called out to them. “Halt! What is your business in Altar!”
  
 Lucas turned to Chu Shen. “Hold on guys,  I got this.” He stepped forward. “We’re traveling and just wanted to spend the night at one of the inns.”
  
 The guards conversed for a little bit before turning back towards them. “We need to ask our commander before we let you in. Please stay there.”
 
  
 One of the guards left while the other nervously gripped his spear. Soon, a man clad in metal armor appeared on the wooden wall. The knight, for that was what he looked like, called out to them. “You say you are travelers, but there is a war going on. We can let you in, but you must agree to an inspection first.”
 
  
 They all glanced at each other before nodding. “Agreed.” Lucas called out. Soon after, some muffled noises and a dull thud came from the gate. The gate swung open slowly. There was a smaller wall made of stone just past the gate with an iron gate attached.
  
 Two soldiers were pushing the gate open and three more soldiers with spears gripped tightly were inside the gate. The guards looked more than a little shocked when they saw them. “They’re just kids!” One of the guards exclaimed, but he was quickly hushed by an elbow from one of his fellow soldiers.
  
 A man in official looking robes was behind the soldiers. In his hand was a crystal globe. While they were studying them, the man stepped forward. “Please step forwards, guests. I will confirm that you are not a threat with the status crystal.”
  
 Lucas shrugged. As he was about to step forward, Aslo rushed past him. Turning towards Lucas, he stuck out his tongue. Facing the robed man, Aslo became serious. “What do you want me to do?”
  
 The guards had relaxed considerably once they saw the ages of Chrissa, Aslo, and Chu Shen. They still seemed wary of Lucas, but that was because of the older look his muscular body gave him.
  
 The robed man was also relaxed because of Aslo’s age. “Just place your hand on the status crystal. Then I can read your status screen and confirm you aren’t a spy sent by the demons.”
  
 Aslo nodded and put his hand on the crystal. “So who are the demons who you’re fighting? Why are you fighting them?”
  
 The robed man looked at Aslo funny. “Well yes, we are fighting the demons. They want to take over the kingdom because of our fertile land that we use to grow our crops and the numerous dungeons that populate our country. I thought this was common knowledge, though.”
  
 Aslo shrugged. “We’re from pretty far away.”
  
 The robed man nodded before glancing down at the status crystal. A blue screen had appeared in front of the status crystal. The robed man was at first only glancing over the information. The robed man suddenly stopped reading and blinked a couple times. Rubbing his eyes, he brought the crystal, along with the blue screen, closer to his face.
  
 Suddenly, the robed man turned to Aslo and fell to his knees. “I am sorry, great fire mage! We had no idea who you were! Please forgive us for suspecting you!”
  
 Everyone, the guards included, were stunned. The guards were glancing around at each other, but one of the quicker-witted soldiers fell to his knees as well. Soon, all five soldiers were kneeling to Aslo.
  
 Aslo bent down next to the robed man. “Why did you call me a great fire mage?”
 
  
 The robed man kept his head down, not daring to look up at Aslo. “Because you are at level one hundred. Such a level has not been seen for so long that only the legends speak of it. To have dared to be impudent enough to ask for inspection, please have mercy upon us.” Some of the guards gasped as they understood the implications of this news.
 
  
 Chu Shen decided to speak up. “So, can we enter the city now?”
  
 The robed man got up and nodded desperately. He backed away, repeatedly bowing. Approaching the iron gate, the robed man knocked on it. A slot in the door opened, revealing a soldier’s peering eyes. The robed man hurriedly whispered a sentence, which caused the soldier to exclaim in surprise.
  
 The iron gate was quickly flung open and the soldiers on the other side kneeled in respect. Chu Shen and his group passed through it quickly into the city. Chu Shen did ask the robed man for directions to a library. The robed man quickly offered to take them, but he refused.
  
 Following the robed man’s directions, they found the library. Upon entering, Chu Shen, Chrissa, and Lucas started researching the power levels in this world. Soon they found that they had a very systematic system that was dictated by the laws of this world.
  
 The people here had all their meridians unblocked when they were born. However, their souls were lacking. They couldn’t control their energy and was limited in how much Qi they could have. Whenever they killed things in this world, they would absorb part of the soul of whatever they defeated.
  
 Soul parts were called xp. Whenever they had collected enough energy to synchronize their meridians with their dantian, they would level up. However, due to the amount of xp needed to level up, they would reach a bottleneck and couldn’t level up. These people had studied their system for a long time, which was how Chu Shen’s group could find the information in the library.
  
 People could still strengthen their souls by growing up and learning like Chu Shen could. As a matter of fact, this was part of the system in this world. That was why farmers could level up, though they would usually only reach level 10 if they were lucky. Battling would always be more effective though, and soul growth through life experience was very limited compared to absorbing monster souls in this world.
  
 Of course, this fact wasn’t inside the library. Instead, Chu Shen assumed it based on how they should have been stronger if they could grow their souls through life and death battles like he did.
  
 Aslo was bored to death with researching. He refused to even glance at a library book. Instead, he wandered around the town and enjoyed the sights. Every time he saw a guard, he would hurriedly hide. It was too embarrassing having the guards bow to him last time.
  
 After an hour, Aslo had wandered close to the city walls. Quickly scaling them, Aslo looked over at the walled city that seemed like it was going to be attacked. Smoke could be seen billowing where the city had previously been. The monster army was just leaving the walled city and was marching towards them.
  
 Aslo jumped off the wall and hurried to tell Chu Shen about it. Before he could get far though, a translucent barrier surrounded him. Without a sound, he disappeared from this world.
 
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 165 – My Place?</h1>
  
 Chu Shen glanced around for the fourth time in as many hours. They were right next to a dirt road that led to a walled city. However, before Chu Shen could study his surroundings in depth, Master Ti Wu floated out before him. “This place seems… familiar. The energy density and universal laws…” He turned to Chu Shen. “Brat, I think we may be back in your universe.”
 
  
 Chu Shen gasped. “Really Master Ti Wu!? Really!?”
  
 Master Ti Wu nodded. “Yes, I believe we are.”
  
 Chu Shen was excited, but he managed to calm himself down. “Master Ti Wu, it hasn’t been five years though. How could we have come back around?”
  
 Master Ti Wu frowned. “You brat, haven’t you already figured out that time flows differently between universes? When you went back to the twins, only an hour had passed for you but a day had already gone by for them. I even told you about this, how could you forget?!”
  
 Chu Shen shied away from Master Ti Wu’s soul form instinctively. “I’m sorry Master! I won’t forget your sage advice ever again!”
  
 “Hmmph.” Master Ti Wu’s rage abated slightly after Chu Shen’s compliment.
  
 Once he stopped cowering, Chu Shen decided to ask something. “Master Ti Wu. I remember you saying that you scanned the planet before. Would you be able to search for the Majestic Sword Academy?”
  
 Master Ti Wu startled. “Yes. Yes I could. Chu Shen! Give me some Null Qi so I can conduct my search.”
 
  
 While this went on, Lucas ignored Master Ti Wu while Aslo and Chrissa explored their surroundings a bit more. Chu Shen remembered how they were thrown from world to world last time and hurriedly marked the ground with his Chains of Transportation, creating a charm that would bring him back to the world once enough Qi was given.
  
 Lucas saw that out of the corner of his eye and hurriedly told Aslo and Chrissa. They all followed suit and created charms for themselves. Master Ti Wu had absorbed half of Chu Shen’s Qi and used it to scan the world. He floated in midair in the lotus position, his eyes closed.
  
 While Master Ti Wu waited, Chu Shen told them about Master Ti Wu’s suspicions. Lucas was happy for him and immediately congratulated him on his return to his home. Aslo slapped him on the back and told him they should have a party to celebrate. Chrissa just smiled as she watched them.
  
 Master Ti Wu opened his eyes. They were pure grey from using Null Qi. “I found your school, brat. It’s close to a hundred miles away, you’re not going to get there any time soon.”
  
 Chu Shen shook his head. “I can just borrow a spaceship from Lucas and be there in a few minutes.”
  
 After Lucas was informed, he decided on a different plan. Launching a satellite, Lucas scanned the planet. It located their group and Lucas displayed a map displaying a two-hundred mile radius.. Master Ti Wu guided Lucas until he zoomed in on Chu Shen’s sect.
  
 Once he had the location, he found a nearby field. Taking note of the coordinates, Lucas activated the teleporter. They all disappeared and then reappeared in that clearing.
  
 Master Ti Wu shook his head. That was practically cheating! Traveling a hundred miles would have been easy with his cultivation, but it would have still taken a couple hours. They, on the other hand, only needed a couple minutes to teleport. Only those mysterious old fogeys with the element of Space could accomplish the same thing.
  
 Void Qi was related to space, but it was oriented more towards the balance of space and the cancellation of all forces then the actual manipulation of space. As a result, teleportation and other spatial manipulation techniques were beyond its capabilities.
  
 SCREEE
  
 The deafening screech caused Chu Shen to cover his ears. Looking up, he saw a very familiar silhouette flying above him. It was a mountain eagle. Chu Shen couldn’t help it; when he saw that eagle, he started crying. For a long time, Chu Shen had been worried about never making it home. Of course, he tried to avoid thinking about it and kept his fears bottled up. Now, they all flowed out of him at once.
  
 Lucas came over and hugged Chu Shen. “Don’t worry Chu Shen, you’re home.” Chu Shen started crying even harder. Master Ti Wu watched silently. Normally he would make some condescending remark, but Chu Shen’s tears reminded him of his own sect and friends. Friends that had been killed by the Five Heavenly Mountains Sect.
  
 After a couple minutes, Chu Shen managed to gather himself. He patted Lucas on the back. “Thanks man, I needed that.”
  
 He decided to finally look around closely. There was a hut at the far end of the field with some fences. Inside the fences were four birds and two giant mammoths.  They were outside the city where Chu Shen had taken the exam to enter the Majestic Sword Academy!
  
 Chu Shen reminisced for a while before he remembered something. “Uh, Master Ti Wu?”
  
 Master Ti Wu was brooding after remembering his dead friends. Chu Shen’s voice startled him. “What, you brat?” The cold voice caused Chu Shen to shiver involuntarily.
  
 He pushed on though. “Well, this isn’t the Majestic Sword Academy. This is where I took the entrance exam.”
  
 Master Ti Wu had a surprised look on his face before glancing around. After realizing it, his face darkened. How could he have made this mistake in front of his disciple? “Let me try again.”
  
 Master Ti Wu had scanned the planet and with his memory he didn’t have to scan again. He remembered the life tablet that his disciple had bound. That should have traces of his disciples soul and Qi. Using that, Master Ti Wu located the Majestic Sword Academy.
  
 He pointed north. “It’s only five miles that way.”
  
 Master Ti Wu once again guided Lucas, allowing them to teleport to a road leading to the academy. Master Ti Wu was still fuming inside. ‘To have made such an error! Ti Wu, you old fogey! Get it together or else you will lose all face in front of these youngsters!’
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 166 - Welcome Home</h1>
  
 Lucas, Aslo and Chrissa decided to stay outside the city. The Majestic Sword Academy only allowed students inside the premises and Chu Shen wasn’t sure he could sneak the other three by. His identity token given to him by the Majestic Sword Academy would let him by the formations, but anyone else would need to receive a visitor's pass and Chu Shen knew he couldn’t get one of them until after he met his teacher.
  
 Chu Shen walked up the mountain path. A large jade gate stood at the top of the path. Carved into the gate were these characters,雄伟剑学院. Translated, they meant Majestic Sword Academy. Two men clad in gold armor and equipped with spears stood guarding the gate.
  
 Upon seeing Chu Shen, the guards became cautious. “Who goes there?” one of them called out.
  
 Chu Shen bowed. “I am Chu Shen, a student of the Majestic Sword Academy.”
  
 The guard had an unbelieving look on his face. “Why are you not in the academy’s uniform then?”
  
 Chu Shen mentally berated himself for not thinking of something so simple, but outwardly he was calm. “I’ve been traveling and my school uniform was destroyed. I do have my identification token though.”
  
 He pulled it out and presented it to one of the guards. The guard studied it before nodding. “You may enter.” He gave a signal and the jade gate slowly swung open.
  
 Chu Shen nodded at them before entering the academy. He found himself wandering past pagodas and huts, the familiar sites bringing him back to his younger days. Ding Dong Ding. The familiar sound of chimes rang out, the sound for class dismissal.
  
 He decided he needed to see someone. The person Chu Shen wanted to meet was his master, Master Lang. Following his memories, he soon found his way to the forge where Master Lang taught him artificing.
  
 Ding Ding Ding
  
 The familiar ring of a hammer striking metal could be heard. Chu Shen approached the forge, smoke billowing out the chimney. Opening the door, a wave of heat slammed into him. He looked into the room.
  
 A man stood there above the forge, his hammer striking down continuously on the red-hot metal in front of him. His bare upper body was caked in sweat, his hair was long and straggled, and parts of his beard were on fire.
  
 It was his master.
  
 Chu Shen approached the anvil and coughed to get his master’s attention. The hammer he was wielding paused in midair. It was then placed on the workbench beside him.
  
 Master Lang spoke without turning around. “To disturb me while I work, do you truly wish to die?” The voice was filled with bitterness and anger.
  
 Chu Shen was shocked at what his master had become. The sheer despair he could hear in his master’s voice caused tears to come to his eyes. “It’s me, Master. Your student, Chu Shen.”
  
 Master Lang stiffened, like he had been poked by a cattle prod. Very slowly, he turned around. He saw Chu Shen. Chu Shen saw him. Both stood there, neither doing a thing.
  
 Very slowly, Master Lang walked over to him. He held out his arms. Chu Shen also held out his arms and went to hug him. A sharp blow to Chu Shen’s head knocked him to the ground. “YOU STUPID DISCIPLE! YOU COULDN’T EVEN LEAVE THE PAVILION ON TIME!” Master Lang yelled at Chu Shen.
  
 Then Master Lang grabbed Chu Shen and hauled him to his feet. He gave him a hug that caused even Chu Shen’s enhanced bones to creak. “However, to have survived when even an elder of the Majestic Sword Academy could not, you truly are a good disciple after all.” Master Lang whispered these words in Chu Shen’s ear, tears streaming down his face.
  
 Chu Shen hugged him back, tears forming in his own eyes. “I’m back, Master. I’m back.”
  
 ………………………………..
  
 After many tears, Chu Shen and Master Lang finally pulled themselves together.
  
 Master Lang grabbed Chu Shen’s shoulders and stared at him. Chu Shen was only two or three inches shorter than him and was just as wide. “You don’t look like you’re seventeen. You’re also two weeks earlier than the pavilion usually comes.” Master Lang remarked offhand.
  
 Chu Shen shrugged. “I don’t know why I got here early. However, I’m only fifteen years old. Time flows differently in the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.”
  
 Master Lang gawked for a second before shrugging. “Temporal acceleration artifacts are rare, but I’ve never heard of one that slows down time. Who would be stupid enough to do that?”
  
 Master Lang shook his head. “Enough of that, we should go meet the principal. I am sure she will have much to ask you.”
 
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “Before we do that master, can you allow some people inside the academy?”
 
  
 Master Lang looked at Chu Shen, confused. “Well, I guess I can allow them in. Who are they though?”
  
 “They’re my friends. They’ve even saved my life a few times.” Chu Shen didn’t really know how else to explain it, but that was enough for Master Lang.
  
 “Well then, they are also friends of mine.” Master Lang seemed satisfied with that. Then, he suddenly turned to Chu Shen. “What cultivation level have you reached?”
 
  
 Chu Shen smiled. “Natural Realm, Nature Stage.”
  
 Master Lang sighed. “Chu Shen, please take it easy on this old man. I don’t think lying to keep my hopes up will help anyone.”
  
 Chu Shen shrugged before an enormous energy was released from his body. The shockwave alone pushed Master Lang back by two feet. Even though he was caught off-guard, Master Lang was still able to brace himself, otherwise he would have been thrown much farther.
  
 Master Lang turned to look at Chu Shen, his shocked expression conveying everything.

  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 167 - Principal</h1>
  
 After Master Lang got over his shock, they went to the gate and let his friends in. Chu Shen introduced Lucas as an aspiring artificer that had some very interesting ideas on the topic of forging. Aslo and Chrissa were friends that had decided to travel with him after he saved them. All of it was true, but Chu Shen left out the part about traveling to different dimensions. It was just too complicated.
  
 When his friends came in, Master Lang guided them his house and told them to rest. Then Master Lang told Chu Shen that he needed to go see the principal and tell her that he was still alive. Chu Shen agreed. After that, they immediately set out to see the principal.
  
 Chu Shen walked with Master Ti Wu to one of the nearby mountains. The path was made up of shining steel and lined with herbs. Soon, they came across a jade gate. Three guards were there.
  
 One of them came forward. “Halt. This is the principal's office. Students may request to see the principal only after gaining the approval of one of the elders.”
  
 Master Lang smiled. “I am one of the elders. I hereby request that me and my student meet with the principal. The news I bear is urgent.”
 
  
 “Please show us proof that you are an elder.” The guard was cautious and didn’t show any outward sign of believing or disbelieving Master Lang’s claim. Master Lang sighed and brought out his ID token. It was made of white jade and had the picture of a sword engraved on the front and a dragon on the back. The guard looked at it before nodding. “You may pass, honored elder.”
 
  
 The gate swung open and Master Lang nodded at the guards before walking by them. The path led to a spacious courtyard lined with precious herbs. The Qi in the atmosphere was thick, allowing the plants to grow rapidly. The path was winding and long, but they reached their destination quickly.
  
 In front of them was a majestic building lined with gold trim. A statue of a sword could be seen in the front. When Chu Shen saw it, he felt as though his body was being cut into millions of tiny pieces.
  
 Master Ti Wu was shocked when he saw the statue. “This statue contains its own sword domain, allowing all who see it to feel as though they were being cut. If one had the sword element, they would undoubtedly be able to create a strong domain from studying this. It seems as though this academy does have some strength to it.”
  
 Master Lang saw Chu Shen’s expression and laughed. “I see you can feel it. This statue was carved by a Cosmic-level expert, the founder of the Majestic Sword Academy. I’m sure that you can reach that level soon though, maybe in a year or two? Anyways, we must go see the principal.”
  
 Master Lang went into the building, leading Chu Shen to a closed door. Once there, he knocked on the door. “Principal Mayweather, I have brought a guest to see you.”
  
 A female’s elderly voice came from inside the office. “Come in, both of you.” Master Lang pushed open the door. Facing them was an elderly woman. Upon seeing Chu Shen, she raised an eyebrow. “I sensed two Natural Realm cultivators, but to think one of them was so young. Tell me Artificer Lang, just who is it that you brought to me today?”
  
 Master Lang grinned. “It is my greatest pleasure to introduce you to my disciple, Chu Shen. He attended the school for a couple months five years ago, but you were never formally introduced to him during that time.”
  
 Principal Mayweather studied Chu Shen. “Odd, I remember that your disciple died in the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. How is he here now?”
  
 Master Lang shook his head. “No Principal Mayweather, he did not die. I kept the life tablet with me and the bond my disciple had with it never faded. He is now here, amongst the living once again.”
  
 “Oh?” Principal Mayweather raised her eyebrows. “Please, tell me more about the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. Just what was it like inside after it left?”
  
 Chu Shen hesitated. Should he tell the truth?
  
 While he was caught in indecision, Master Ti Wu spoke to him mentally. ‘Brat, you can tell her about the other dimensions. It is no secret that other dimensions exist and that one can travel to them. Cosmic-Level cultivators such as this principal can already enter other dimensions. Just don’t tell her you know what they are, merely describe to her that you went to weird places.’
  
 ‘Thank you Master Ti Wu.’ Chu Shen proceeded to inform Principal Mayweather about some of the worlds he went to.
  
 “I did not stay inside the Pavilion during these five years. Instead, the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion would cause me to teleport to random locations at random times. The first one was filled with people that didn’t cultivate but crafted strange artifacts to fight. The second one was just like ours. The next one had people with their elements already awoken at birth. Another location had strange puppets that fought me as soon as I arrived, but left me alone later on.”
  
 In this manner, Chu Shen proceeded to tell them about the weird places he had gone. He did not tell them about what he did in each world, but instead informed them of what each world was like and how it differed from their own. Principal Mayweather was startled but did not reject Chu Shen’s stories. Master Lang was confused about the places his disciple described.
  
 Chu Shen finished describing the places he had been to. No one spoke for a little while before Principal Mayweather sighed. “I see. You have experienced a lot for someone so young. No wonder you have grown so much; anyone's soul would grow after seeing these different worlds. Though I don’t believe it would be this pronounced unless you were already a genius. I would ask about what you did on each world, but I understand everyone has their secrets and that we would not be able to understand them anyways. You may go, Chu Shen.”
  
 Chu Shen bowed. “Thank you Principal Mayweather. However, may I be so bold as to ask a favor?”
  
 Principal Mayweather waved her hand. “Yes, go ahead and tell me your wish.”
  
 “May some friends of mine be enrolled as students? One of them is a genius artificer and the other two have already reached my own cultivation level. Because of where they are from, they are lacking in the cultivation knowledge department, and I myself still lack knowledge. Also, will I still be enrolled as a student?”
  
 The question seemed to shock her more than Chu Shen traveling to different dimensions. She seriously considered it for a while before nodding. “I believe it can be arranged. They can be privately tutored until they learn proper behavior, and then they can enroll in the advanced classes here at the academy. You will also be taught alongside them if you wish, though I do ask that you enroll under a different name. It would be too much of a hassle if it was discovered that you survived.”
  
 Chu Shen bowed. “Thank you, Principal Mayweather.”
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 168 - Integration</h1>
  
 It had been a week since the talk with the principal. During that time, Aslo, Chrissa, and Lucas had been very busy. The lectures that Chu Shen had endured during his school years were thrown at them in highly condensed forms. Aslo and Chrissa could barely keep up with it, but Lucas was easily acing everything. Quite frankly, his cybernetic brain was the real reason.
  
 Aslo was learning, though he constantly complained about it. Chrissa was studying earnestly and didn’t speak much, just as she always had. Lucas was absorbing all of the knowledge like a sponge.
  
 What he really loved  was artificing, though. Master Lang continued to teach Chu Shen artificing and Lucas also joined in on the lecture. At first, Master Lang was apprehensive whenChu Shen told him that Lucas was an artificing genius.
  
 However, Master Lang was dumbfounded when Lucas instantly copied an inscription just by watching him make it once or twice. Master Lang started becoming interested in his disciple’s friend and started teaching him.
  
 Soon, Master Lang became nervous. ‘This kid is instantly learning what should take years to perfect in mere seconds! My own disciple is exceptional and learns fast, but compared to his friend, he is only average. No wonder he said this kid was a genius.’
  
 Lucas started making some of his own inventions, like a gun that used an explosion inscription to fire. When Master Lang saw it, he instantly recognized the potential uses of it, and the downsides. There was only one way to load it for now, and that was to put small pellets down the barrel and activate the inscription. Together, they started to make a more refined version of it.
  
 Chu Shen felt left out. ‘Isn’t Master Lang my master? So how come Lucas is the one he’s actually teaching?’
  
 Chu Shen would spend six hours every day being taught by teachers in one-on-one sessions. He would then see Master Lang and forge for the next five hours. Finally, he would spend an hour improving his domain.
  
 He remembered the first time he had formed his domain.
  
 ………………………………………..
  
 “Alright brat, it’s time to take the next step in your cultivation.” Master Ti Wu floated in front of him. “This step is called the domain. One creates an area around them where their element reigns supreme. For you, that means creating an area of Null Qi.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “I’m ready Master, please teach me.” Currently they were in the courtyard of his house, one that the principal had given to him as part of his enrollment.
  
 Master Ti Wu grinned. “Alright. The first step is to establish a territory. Create a sphere of Qi around you. Nothing else for now, just do that.”
  
 Chu Shen closed his eyes and held out his hands. Gray colored Qi floated out of his hands, creating what looked like fog. Soon, the fog was in the shape of a 10 foot sphere around him.
  
 Master Lang floated around it and nodded. “Good, good. A basic start, but a start nonetheless. Now, a domain is very important because it can weaken your opponent and protect you from their attacks. It is also important because you can deal with many people at once. You won’t be overwhelmed by numbers anymore.”
  
 “To train your domain you need to do only one thing. Continuously make it bigger. Let it grow and train yourself. For others, they also have to make the domain stronger and fiercer, like making a flame domain hotter,an earth domain firmer, or a sword domain sharper. For you, you don’t have to worry. Null Qi cannot be improved until you can turn it into Void Qi. You won’t be able to do that until you reach the Celestial Realm, so don’t concern yourself with it now.”
  
 Chu Shen absorbed all of this information and began training. He started expanding the fog, attempting to grow it. It grew to a diameter of 200 feet, but there was a pressure pouring down upon him. It was like gravity was increasing and his body was becoming heavier. He didn’t understand. He had enough Qi, so why was he feeling this force?
  
 Master Ti Wu grinned. “You feel that? That is the world rejecting you! Normally, when you use Qi, it is assimilated with the atmosphere, becoming one with the world. Now though, you are replacing the world’s Qi. It’s similar to a bubble forming underwater. If you can’t withstand that pressure, your domain pops. That is the reason you have to train. Train until you can withstand the force of the world.”
  
 Chu Shen gritted his teeth and continued pushing. Suddenly, his Qi swirled. It started dissipating, disappearing into the atmosphere. His domain was broken. Shocked, Chu Shen attempted to bring it back and it flowed back into his body. He couldn’t reform his domain though. This was Null Qi, absorber of all things! How could the world force it apart?
  
 When he asked Master Ti Wu, he gave Chu Shen a surprising answer. “Well yes, Null Qi can absorb a lot of things. However, it can’t absorb them all. Remember that Null Qi can’t absorb physical objects and the pressure of the world is one of these things. Even Void Qi can’t absorb it, I don’t know why.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. If his Qi really could ignore the pressure of the world, that would have really been overpowered. Imagine a domain that could expand to cover the whole world, one that could absorb Qi and become stronger. If one could do that, they would be unstoppable.
  
 The Void Sect would have never fallen if they could truly do that. No one would have been able to stop them.
  
 ………………………………………………
  
 Chu Shen went to his room after doing his daily training. He had already been able to increase his domain to 280 feet. To martial artists, this distance was nothing and could be covered in less than a second. It was still progress though, and progress was cumulative.
  
 He heard a knock at the door and went to answer it. Master Lang stood in front of the door, a letter in his hand. He held it out to Chu Shen. “This is a letter from your parents. I assumed you would want it as soon as possible. I had any mail that was sent for you directed to me five years ago, so the sect sent it to me instead.”
 
  
 Chu Shen hesitantly took the scroll from his master’s hand. “Thank you Master Lang. I suppose it has been long enough for my dad to send me another message. He did promise to meet in five years, after all.”
  
 Chu Shen opened the scroll.
  
 ‘Son, it has been five years. I can no longer talk to you as an immature boy but instead as a young man. I hope you have made me proud. I have not been able to hear about your exploits since I have been in hiding, but I am sure they are marvelous. I promised you that your mother and I would meet you and we shall. Please come to our old home in four days’ time. I hope you have grown strong enough, Son. We shall see you soon.’
  
 Chu Shen looked up at the ceiling. “It’s been five years. I wonder how you’ve been, Dad.”
 

  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 169 - Again?</h1>
  
 Using Master Lang’s influence, Chu Shen was easily able to borrow a Mountain Eagle to take him back home. He set out three days later with Master Lang, wanting to arrive early for his parents. Soon, he found himself flying home.
  
 BOOM!
  
 SCREEEE!
  
 The carriage that was mounted on the back of the Mountain Eagle was shaken by the explosion. Master Lang and Chu Shen both calmly exited the carriage, standing on the back of the eagle now. Outside, they both saw a horde of golden scaled birds carrying people on their backs. A large blood-red bird bore a man carrying a giant axe on its head.
  
 This man started to yell at them. “Honored sirs! I am sorry to ask this of you, but the Golden Eagle Sect has fallen on hard times! Since you are flying over our sect, I am afraid you will have to pay the toll!”
  
 Master Lang turned to the driver. “What is this ‘Golden Eagle Sect’ these men are talking about? I’ve never heard of it before.”
  
 The driver shook his head. “I’m afraid there is no sect. Instead, they are a bandit group that travel to and fro while calling themselves this name. Supposedly, the bandit leader wanted to make a sect once, but he liked robbing people too much so he called his gang a sect instead. He is very dangerous and is a Martial Emperor.”
  
 Master Lang nodded. “I see. So essentially, they just want to rob us.” He ignored the man’s level since he hadn’t reached the Nature stage yet. Without it, the man couldn’t challenge him.
  
 Chu Shen grinned. “Well Master Lang, I wanted to show you how I fight. Now is the perfect time, since they have provided us with some targets.”
 
  
 Master Lang shook his head. “How about I give you a lesson on what my powers are. If there are any left, you can show me your own. Elders first, after all.”
  
 Chu Shen sighed. “Fine master, go ahead.”
  
 Master Lang withdrew his mace from his spatial ring. “I guess it’s time.” Earth Qi covered his body, turning into earthen-colored armor. He tapped his armor. “This is simply condensed Qi to protect myself. By controlling the Qi, I can also fly. It is very taxing on my energy reserves and I have a maximum flight time of around an hour.”
  
 “Also, as I am sure you are aware by now, we must all create domains. There are many domains earth types can have, but I have the mountain element, a rare form of the earth element. If I had the sand element, my domain could be a sandstorm. A normal earth domain might be spikes of rock emerging from the ground. For me though, it is the gravity domain. I use the pressure of mountains to make my opponents heavier.” A faint mountain appeared behind Master Lang.
  
 Master Lang sighed. “Unfortunately, I never had much luck controlling my domain and couldn’t expand it beyond a hundred feet. Otherwise, I may have become a much better fighter.”
  
 The axe-wielding man was too far away to hear them talking. He could, however, see them. Upon seeing Master Lang pull out an axe, he immediately ordered his men to form six arrowhead formations. This was a formation that he had created that allowed them to create the energy projection of a spear. Using this, each formation would be on par with a late-stage Martial Emperor.
  
 It wouldn’t normally have been possible, but each of his men had soulbonded with their Golden Eagle mounts, allowing them to combine their Qi and the beasts’ Qi together. His men were all at the Martial Army stage and their beasts were at the Martial Scholar stage. He had 42 men with eagles and each formation had 7 men in it.
  
 The axe-wielding man had been lucky and had found a mountain cliff where several Golden Eagle couples had made their nest. He had killed the adults and stolen their eggs. These 47 eggs caused his ambitions to grow, allowing him to make an airborne bandit group. Luckily, he was at the Earth stage, which allowed him to gain some followers. After selling off 5 of the eggs, he was able to equip his men adequately and buy enough resources to advance their cultivation swiftly.
  
 Master Lang saw the bandits get into formation. “Hoh. I just might need your help, Chu Shen. It appears as though these bandits are more organized then I thought.”
  
 The axe-wielding man called out. “Sirs, I don’t believe I am being unreasonable. Pay us ten beast cores of the Martial King stage or their equivalent in spirit stones and we will let you leave unharmed.”
  
 Master Lang flew into the air. “I’m sorry, but any bandit attempting to rob me will have to pay the price.” He swung his mace at the bandit, a mountain flying at the man.
  
 The man waved his axe. “Forward, men! Activate the formation! This is an expert at the Nature Stage. Imagine the wealth he has on him! We still outnumber him and kill him easily enough!”
  
 The bandit leader was truly skilled. Warning his men of the dangers while reassuring them of their success and reminding them of their potential gain was impressive. Truly, he was a charismatic leader.
  
 Six spears formed around the arrowhead formations. Two of the spears charged forth, meeting the mountain. It split in two before crumbling apart. The two spears continued their charge towards Master Lang. The other four spears charged in behind the two spears with the bandit leader in front of them.
  
 The two spears suddenly fell downwards a hundred feet when they got close to Master Lang. They were in range of his gravity domain. 280 feet. The bandit leader paused their charge and called back the two formations that were affected by Master Lang’s domain. He talked with them for a second to see what had caused their sudden falling and determined it was a domain that pressured the opponent.
  
 “Alright men, his domain isn’t lethal and can only hinder us. Charge! Come in from above so that you fall on top of him and kill him that way!” The bandit leader led the way as he flew upwards above the Mountain Eagle. They suddenly dive bombed Master Lang, looking like giant arrows hurtling downwards.
  
 Master Lang swung his mace rapidly, throwing mountains of Qi at the enemy. He concentrated on one of the formations at the front and several mountains smashed into it. The formation easily defended itself against two. The third one caused it to dim, and the sixth caused cracks to appear. Then, the seventh one broke the formation and killed three of the golden eagles. The other four split up and broke out of their dive, clearing the way for the other ones that were following closely behind.
  
 Chu Shen had been watching his master fight and realized that his master’s domain was meant for fighting on the ground. With it active, his enemy couldn’t fly above him and would constantly have to fight the gravity and his master. It could be considered a strong supporting domain. For fights in the sky though, it was a severe disadvantage.
  
 Realizing this, he decided to help out a little bit. The bandits were only 150 feet away, too close for comfort, and they were now well in range of his domain. “Master Lang, I’ll activate my domain now.” Gray fog flowed forth from Chu Shen’s hands, billowing out. Suddenly, the fog expanded to two hundred feet.
  
 Master Lang let out a yelp. “What kind of domain is this, boy? My Qi is vanishing while I’m in it! Don’t tell me you don’t know how to choose who is affected by your domain!?”
  
 Chu Shen grinned sheepishly. The fog was dense, but it was still only energy. One could see through it, which allowed Master Lang to see his face. “I’m still working on it.” The domain had covered the five formations and the bandit leader.
  
 The formations started to dissolve, the energy keeping the formation working being absorbed by the domain. The bandit leader was shocked. “What? Another Nature Realm expert! Not only that, but they have the rare shadow element with a devouring domain!”
  
 Such an element was very rare, only ten people in the last thousand years had awakened the shadow element. Those with a devouring domain were even rarer, only two had ever been recorded in history. No one knew how a devouring domain was created, but those characters were always leading experts in their generation.
  
 Only one thought filled the bandit leader’s head. Flee! “We can’t face them. Hurry! Flee! Split up and separate!”
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 170 - Surprise!</h1>
  
 Chu Shen grinned. This one move had already broken their formations. This next move would kill them, though. The fog-like domain started to shudder. The bandits that were fleeing started shaking and stuttering. They looked as though they were being continuously hit by some invisible force.
  
 Many of them started to cough up blood. Their mounts were weaker than them and were also suffering. Their Golden Eagles all let out screeches almost simultaneously before going into free fall.
  
 Chu Shen smiled.  (Song of the Universe: Solar Vibrations) was far more effective then he had thought it could be. The bandit leader was affected by his attack, but he still managed to flee on his mount. He spat out a mouthful of blood before wiping his mouth. The red bird below him was barely hanging on, but it still lived, its fear allowing it to fly away swiftly. The bandit leader sighed. “That was too close. Such terrifying might.”
  
 A boom rang out behind him. Scared, the bandit leader turned to look at the Mountain Eagle that he had just attempted to rob. He saw Chu Shen charging towards him while stepping on Qi that solidified below him. It only took two seconds for Chu Shen to catch up to the bandit leader.
 
 Realizing he couldn’t escape, the bandit leader drew his axe. “Don’t look down on me! If you want to kill me, you will have to pay the price!” Qi surged on the man’s axe as Chu Shen got closer.
  
 Chu Shen sneered. He was finally going to get the chance to test out a technique he had just learned. His image shimmered, becoming indistinct. Suddenly, there was two of him. This was clearly (Stars Dance: Celestial Twin)!
  
 The bandit leader was confused but swung his axe horizontally, slashing out at both versions of Chu Shen. The two images both shot upwards, avoiding the blow. They were like mirror images, performing the exact same move in perfect synchronicity. A disk of Qi formed in front of the image on the right of the bandit leader.
  
 The disk drew the bandit leader’s attention. Immediately, he determined this was the real Chu Shen. The disk suddenly let out a flash of bright white light, blinding the man. Yet another move of the the Stars Dance set, (Stars Dance: Stars Light)!
  
 The man was blinded now and randomly waved his axe around. Chu Shen used this opportunity to dash in, his hammer held in his hands. With his immense strength and speed, the hammer had terrifying force. It smashed into the bandit leader’s axe, turning it into dust from the immense vibrations caused by Song of the Universe. It continued without hindrance and directly struck the bandit leader’s head, smashing it like a rock smashing an egg.
  
 Master Lang watched as his disciple single handedly took out the bandit group that had given him such trouble. Master Lang sighed. If the bandits had been on the ground, he would have easily been able to kill them. Instead, they had almost used his own domain to increase their killing power.
  
 Chu Shen dashed back and landed beside his master. “Heh heh. How did I do, Master? I’m pretty strong now, right?”
 
  
 A fist smashed into his head. “So dumb! You don’t even know how choose who is affected by your domain! I still have a lot to teach you, it seems.”
  
 Chu Shen rubbed his head sullenly. “It’s not my fault. You’ve been so busy with Lucas that you haven’t had time for me.”
  
 Master Lang shrugged. “That’s because he is an artificing genius. You can only encounter them by luck.”
  
 “Hey! You said I was an artificing genius too!”
  
 “But Lucas is more of a genius than you.”
 
  
 “Argh!”
  
 The Mountain Eagle continued on its way to the Chu branch Sect Misty Pass. The tamer guided the beast, ignoring the squabble of master and disciple. Inwardly, he was trembling with fright. Such might! Truly, one couldn’t judge by appearances.
  
 ……………………………………
  
 Chu Shen and Master Lang were dropped off at the entrance of the Chu branch Sect Misty Pass. They walked past stores and houses. Smoke rose from the old forge Master Lang had used. The town hadn’t changed at all.
  
 Some of the people recognized Master Lang and bowed, respectfully greeting him. As for Chu Shen, he had changed too much for those people to recognize him. Soon, they reached the Patriarch’s building. It was the same house that Chu Shen had grown up in under his dad.
  
 Guards stood at the gate, protecting it from intruders. Upon seeing Master Lang, the guards stiffened. One of them drew his spear. “Halt, this is-”
 
  
 Another guard quickly forced the spear downwards. “Shut up, you idiot.” He turned towards Master Lang. “Master Lang, I apologize, he is new and zealous in his duties. You may go in and see Chu Gui if you wish.”
  
 Chu Gui was a relative of Chu Shen’s and they weren’t very close. Chu Gui was his father’s right hand man and was very busy with the details of the sect, so he had never had time to bond with Chu Shen.
  
 Walking briskly, they went to the Patriarch’s office. Master Lang knocked on the door. “Patriarch Gui, it is Artificer Lang.”
 
  
 The door was opened by a graying man with black hair. He smiled and bowed to Master Lang. “Ah, Artificer Lang. It has been a while since our marvelous crafter visited us.”
  
 Master Lang bowed in return. “Indeed. Chu Shen received word from his father that he would meet us here tomorrow. I decided to ask if we could stay here for the night.”
  
 Chu Gui was startled, turning to look at Chu Shen. “Oh my. I am sorry Chu Shen, it has been a long time since I last saw you. My, how you’ve grown! This was your house before and I have no reason to deny your staying here now. Please, I can show you to your old chambers. Your dad insisted I keep them closed before he left on his journey around the continent.”
  
 As Chu Gui guided them to Chu Shen’s old room, he continued talking about his dad. “Honestly, I have no idea why Chu Bai decided to leave. It’s just like him though, free spirited as the wind. I’m actually quite relieved since I hadn’t seen that side of him since your mother died.”
 
  
 He remembered who he was talking to and stopped. “I’m sorry Chu Shen, I spoke without thinking.”
  
 Chu Shen waved his hand. “Don’t think much of it, Patriarch Gui. I didn’t know my mom very well, she died when I was too young to remember.” He chuckled internally. Very soon, he would be meeting his mom anyways.
  
 Chu Gui didn’t talk until he reached an old wooden door. “This is your room. Master Lang, I can guide you to your own if you want.”
 
  
 Master Lang nodded. “Thank you Chu Gui, you honor me.”
  
 They departed, leaving Chu Shen to his memories. He walked into the room and sat down on his bed, a cloud of dust billowing up as he plopped down. He coughed. “Man, has it really been that long?”
  
 A surge of Qi from the roof above him startled Chu Shen. The roof exploded as black Qi in the shape of a hand broke through the roof. A man dressed in black robes swooped downwards, landing in front of Chu Shen.
  
 His face was covered in shadows by his cloak. Sinister laughter rang out as he stared at Chu Shen. “Hehehe! To think the young master Chu Shen took the bait. It seems as though we can finally regain that wood element girl. Hehehe!”
 
 
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 171 - An Iron Plate</h1>
  
 The man stretched out his hand, inky black qi forming around it. The hand-shaped Qi grabbed Chu Shen, picking him up off the ground. The man then darted upwards, Chu Shen hauled behind him like a kite.
  
 Chu Shen was shocked. Just who was this person and who was this wood element girl he mentioned? Something else sunk in. The man said he took the bait and he was waiting at his old house. Did this mean that the letter he received from his dad was actually a fake?!
  
 This man seemed to have the shadow element and was an expert in ambushing. He was only a Martial Emperor yet Chu Shen hadn’t been able to detect him at all. Chu Shen’s Qi formed around him, instantly expanding over 200 feet, forming his domain.
  
 The black hand of Qi holding him started to dissolve as the man noticed something was wrong. “Dangit! Did that Master Lang already discover me?! Where is he?!” The man started looking around before realizing that Chu Shen was actually the one forming the domain.
  
 “What! This brat, he’s only 17 this year. How could he already be in the Natural Realm!” The man panicked and started to flee only to realize that the Qi he was using to fly was starting to disappear. The man’s speed naturally started to fall and soon he was barely able to hover.
  
 The bandit leader had only been able to escape because his mount had wings and could fly without the assistance of Qi. The man started to fall to the ground while Chu Shen followed, keeping the man in his domain while he fell.
  
 The man had carried him a little bit aways from his house and they were now in the medicinal gardens. Master Lang carrying Patriarch Gui flew out of the house. Both of them had sensed the surges of power shortly after they had left and immediately rushed to see what was happening.
  
 Patriarch Gui was panicked because he felt Chu Shen couldn’t deal with the power he felt. Master Lang, on the other hand, felt as though he wouldn’t be of much use. Chu Shen was just as strong, if not stronger, then him. If his disciple couldn’t handle this threat, then he wouldn’t be able to either.
  
 Chu Shen picked up the man he had captured by the throat. “Talk! Who are you, who sent you, why did you want me, and why did you say I took the bait?
  
 The man was choking now because of the tight grip Chu Shen had on him. Master Lang had just landed beside him and tapped his arm. “Uh, Chu Shen. I don’t think he can talk at all right now.”
  
 Getting the hint, Chu Shen dropped the man. The man went to his knees and coughing while one of his hands went to his throat. A red handprint could be seen where Chu Shen had grabbed him. The man slowly got to his feet after regaining his breath.
  
 The man looked at Chu Shen before he sighed. “If I knew how strong you were, I never would have accepted.”
  
 Chu Shen glared at him. “Speak.”
  
 The man flinched. He nervously looked around before he started talking.  “My name is Luo Yunpeng, core disciple of Blazing Tiger Sect. They apparently had someone related to you with a wood element that escaped some years ago. They have been pursuing her for almost five years and finally lost patience. They wanted to threaten you to get her back. I said you took the bait simply because I faked a letter from your dad to lure you here.”
  
 While Luo Yungpeng answered Chu Shen’s questions, he started cursing mentally. He had been given this assignment and hadn’t thought it would be difficult. This time around, he was supposed to abduct a 17 year old kid that had reached at least the Martial Army stage. To him, a late stage Martial Emperor, this would be child’s play. The only problem was that his teacher was at the Earth Stage.
  
 He had the shadow element and had just started refining his elemental Qi, making him a half-step Earth Stage cultivator. Because of his shadow element, he was perfect for ambushes and could hide from Nature Stage cultivators. Because of this, he thought he simply needed to observe the kid for awhile until his master left and then snatch him.
  
 He had been observing the patriarch’s house because he figured they would at least pay their respects when they arrived. Of course, he was only paying it some attention since they were only supposed to arrive tomorrow but unexpectedly the were a day early.
  
 Oh how lucky he thought he was when the kid’s master left him. Quickly swooping in, he snatched the kid and started to flee. If the kid hadn’t been this strong, he would have undoubtedly left without his master being able to pursue him. He had truly kicked an iron plate this time.
  
 When he heard that someone related to him had escaped, Chu Shen immediately thought of his mom. Upon hearing they had been chasing her for five years he became excited. This was definitely his mom! All the signs pointed to it!
  
 Chu Shen grabbed Luo  Yungpeng’s shoulders. “Her name! Tell me her name!”
  
 Luo Yungpeng had relaxed slightly after telling them he was a core disciple of the Blazing Tiger sect. They wouldn’t dare do anything to him after that, right? It had appeared as though he had been right since they hadn’t touched him afterwards. Now though, he was frightened out of his wits. These people could easily kill him and he wouldn’t have a chance to fight back.
  
 “H-her name is Chu Lai.”
  
 Master Lang grabbed Chu Shen and pulled him off Yungpeng. “Stop that! Chu Shen, do you know anything about the Blazing Tiger sect?”
  
 Chu Shen shook his head and glanced back to make sure Luo Yungpeng wasn’t attempting to runaway. Master Lang nodded and sighed. “Well, then you might not understand but I will attempt to tell you. The Blazing Tiger sect is a sect equal to our sect. They are one of the four major powers under the empire. We can’t fight with them and we also can’t accuse them of anything.”
  
 Chu Shen frowned. “I understand that they’re powerful, but that is my mom we are talking about! That was my mom’s name! My dad should also be caught up in this.” He glared at Luo Yungpeng. “I should’ve known that it was a fake message when it didn’t have the blood seal like the last message my dad sent. The blood seal is impossible to fake and requires someone directly related to the sender.”
  
 Chu Shen sighed. “Help me Master Lang. I don’t know what to do.”
  
 Master Lang scratched his head. “Well, I can at least tell you why they would want your mom if she truly does have the wood element. It would at least explain why they captured her but didn’t kill her.”
  
 
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 172 - Wood Element</h1>
  
 Master Lang started to speak. “The wood element is very rare and not many can awaken it. For every element, there are unique fighting styles. Each one is different and adapted to the specific element.”
  
 “Fire’s fighting style is oriented towards explosiveness, suddenly lashing out at full force. Wind is excellent for speed and quick attacks. Earth is meant for defense or overwhelming might. However, elements are not just useful for fighting.”
  
 “Take the water element. It can be used to end droughts or heal. The earth element can be used to stop volcanoes or revitalize farming land. The fire element can purify objects and be used to forge. Every element has many uses, but wood is one that surpasses all of them in terms of importance.”
  
 “What is required for pills? Rare herbs that have grown with Qi are necessary ingredients. Many sects have herb gardens where they grow these herbs for the pills. However, they need time to grow. Often a hundred years will pass before a herb reaches maturity and the rarest herbs can require a thousand years.”
  
 “However, there is one instance in which herbs that should take hundreds of years can mature in months. Rare herbs can be cultivated when they shouldn’t grow and dead herbs can be revitalized. That is the mysteriousness of the wood element.”
 
  
 “If your mom has the wood element, then they most likely kidnapped her to help cultivate their herb gardens. In order to support their geniuses and raise the prowess of their sect, they would do anything to capture someone with the wood element.”
  
 Chu Shen was stunned at this revelation. Just how strong was the wood element? A Natural realm cultivator was the powerhouse of a sect. However, a wood element cultivator at the Natural realm could allow dozens of disciples to reach the Natural realm. How terrifying was that?!
  
 It is said that what one fears the most is not one sharp spear, but a storm of dull blades. Raising disciples’ levels through pills would make them weaker than genuine Natural realm geniuses. With the wood element though, they would be able to create many dozens of Natural realm experts. They would be able to overwhelm the cultivating world with numbers alone!
  
 Of course, this was based upon there being an alchemist to create the pills. Without such an alchemist, the herbs would be next to useless. As Chu Shen was lost in thought, Master Ti Wu appeared in front of him.
  
 “What your master spoke is the truth. The wood element is a very rare element indeed. Even in my dimension, it would appear every thousand years. Any sect that could gain such a genius would be destined for greatness.”
  
 “There was a time when one of the major sects was able to gain a wood element genius. This sect later became the hegemony of my cultivation world for over a millennia because of the wood element genius. They had over a hundred times the amount of people at all power levels any other sect had at the time and was able to rule because of this. If your mom truly is a wood element genius, then I can only say that she is both fortunate and unfortunate.”
  
 Master Lang had been studying Chu Shen and saw how his face had changed as he realized all of the implications this had. “Chu Shen. I am sure you are aware now just how desperate all of the sects will be because of your mom. The Blazing Tiger sect will never stop until your mom is imprisoned and all who have heard of her ability are dead.”
  
 Chu Shen sighed. “I know, Master Lang. I am aware of how impossible this task will be. However, she is my mom. I cannot stop just because of how important she is.”
  
 Master Lang nodded. “Good. In that case, this old man will support you no matter what.” He turned towards Luo Yungpeng. “So, what should we do with this person?”
  
 Chu Shen shrugged. “I don’t know.”
  
 Master Lang shook his head. “I expected a little more from my disciple.” As he said that, he got closer to Luo Yungpeng. His gravity domain suddenly activated.
 
 “Ugh.” Luo Yungpeng grunted. “Wha-what are you doing?! I’m a disciple of the Blazing Tiger sect!”
  
 “Oh I know very well what sect you belong to.” Master Lang swung his hand downwards at Luo Yungpeng. His mace appeared in his hand, smashing into Luo Yungpeng’s skull. It crushed his skull, blood splattering everywhere.
  
 Chu Shen was flabbergasted at this. “Why did you do that? He surrendered!”
  
 Master Lang sighed. “I had no choice. If we let him go, then they would’ve known how strong you are. We can’t have that, but we also can’t imprison him. He’s too strong and his element is the shadow element; he would have been able to escape from anywhere we tried to imprison him.”
  
 Chu Shen stared at the corpse of Luo Yungpeng. “It still seems wrong though.”
  
 Master Lang shrugged. “Right and wrong, good and evil. I wish everything was as black and white as those terms but nothing is truly simple. Those terms can only be used in storybooks. What I did was not right, but it wasn’t evil either. It was necessary, however.”
  
 After this lesson, Chu Shen helped Master Lang and Chu Gui clean up the corpse and the mess caused by their fight. He found a different room so that the workers could fix his room’s roof. They rested before departing back to the Majestic Sword Academy.
  
 Upon arriving, Chu Shen received a letter. This time it had a blood seal on it. Dripping his blood on the black square, he waited as the words started to appear on the sheet.
  
 ‘Chu Shen. It has been a while, I hope you have been well, my son. Remember our promise that you would reach the World Stage. I hope you have done so because it is now time. I will be on the path to Majestic Sword Academy. Come meet me and I will take you to see your mother.’
  
 Chu Shen grinned. The letter had a blood seal, which meant someone related to him by blood had written the message. It also mentioned the five-year promise between him and his dad. No one besides them had been informed of that promise, not even Master Lang.
  
 “I don’t believe anyone could copy this. It has to be my dad, it has to be!”
 
 
 
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 173 - Old Man</h1>
  
 Chu Shen walked down the mountain path, passing through the jade gate that lead to the Majestic Sword Academy. Soon, he came to the foot of the mountains. He saw an old man at the foot of the mountains, walking towards the stairway.
  
 His hair was gray, his robe was dirty with tears in it. He was stooped over and would have fit in with the beggars on the side of a road. This old man though, he had a familiar aura to him. Chu Shen was struck with a thought. Could this be his father?
  
 Upon hearing Chu Shen’s footsteps, the man glanced upwards. His face had wrinkles on it and a long scar could be seen across his right eye. The eye was clouded and blind. Chu Shen sighed. It wasn’t his dad.
  
 The old man stumbled and fell. Chu Shen hurriedly came over. “Are you alright, old man? Anything broken?”
  
 The man shook his head and used Chu Shen’s outstretched arm to pick himself up. “No, I’m fine. You know, I have a son about your age in the academy. I was just going to visit him.”
  
 “Oh?” Chu Shen became curious. “Well, would you like me escort you up the mountain?” He was supposed to meet his dad here but he didn’t specify a time. He was already at the foot of the mountain and his dad wasn’t here, so escorting this old man wouldn’t waste too much time.
  
 The man smiled and nodded. “Yes, that would be wonderful.”
  
 Chu Shen held the old man’s elbow as they slowly walked up the mountain. They were halfway up when the old man started to talk. “I always raised my boy to respect his elders, to look after those who couldn’t look after themselves. It’s nice to see someone else doing so in his stead.”
  
 Chu Shen smiled. “It’s nothing. My dad taught me that as well. Actually, I wanted to ask you something, if you don’t mind.”
  
 The old man smiled kindly at him. “Go ahead, I won’t mind.”
  
 “What is the name of your son?”
  
 The old man grinned. “Well now, that is something I wish to keep a secret for a while longer.”
  
 Chu Shen smiled. “Then I guess I’ll have to keep you company for a while longer. Could you tell me a little more about your son? Maybe I’ll recognize him then.”
  
 The old man smiled softly before he started talking. “Well, my son is very kind. Maybe he has changed since then, the martial path does tend to harden the hearts of many. But I believe that he still the same innocent boy.”
  
 “He went through some hard times as a boy. More than most others would have. I believe it gave him the character he needs to stay true to my teachings. He is talented though, very talented. But he had a poor constitution which would have limited him in the future.”
  
 “Luckily, a traveling expert was able to heal him and fix his constitution. Thanks to that expert, my boy reached a decent cultivation level and was the strongest in our village. That was how he was able to enter the Majestic Sword Academy.”
  
 “He’s hard-working and loved crafting. I remember those days when he would come home, blisters on his hands from forging all day. His face would be cracked and dry from the heat of the forge. Oh, how he made me proud with his determination.”
  
 Chu Shen slowed as the old man spoke, until both of them were standing on the mountain path. The old man turned to him with tears in his eyes. “I wasn’t able to visit my son, but I can imagine that he grew up well these years. That he is strong yet kind to those who are weak. That son of mine, Chu Shen.”
  
 A teardrop formed in Chu Shen’s eyes. “Don’t worry. I know how he turned out, dad.”
  
 Both of them hugged each other, tears freely flowing down their faces. After some time, they both recovered their composure. Chu Shen’s father wiped his face before smiling at him. “So? What do you think of your father’s disguise techniques?”
  
 Chu Shen grinned. “You really do resemble an old man; you are truly good at disguises.”
  
 Chu Bai laughed. “The world is dangerous, everyone needs some sort of survival skill. I had lots of time to practice it over the past five years.” His face became grim. “Son, I will take you to your mom now.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded solemnly. “I understand. I had an encounter with the Blazing Tiger sect already. Is it true that mother has the wood element?”
  
 Chu Bai was shocked. “Son, did you truly encounter the Blazing Tiger sect?”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “Yes. They sent a Martial Emperor to kidnap me. Apparently they wanted to force Mom out.”
  
 Chu Bai nodded. “Yes, your mom does have the wood element. Since you know that, I assume you also know why the wood element is so precious?”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “I do, but I don’t understand. Why did you not go to the Chu Sect? They would certainly protect mom and they are on par with the Blazing Tiger sect in power. “
  
 Chu Bai sighed. “That is true, but your mother just wishes to live a quiet life. That was actually the reason she cultivated to begin with. She never would have cultivated except her family was almost killed by bandits. In order to protect herself and her family, she cultivated to become strong. She never did it to gain fame but simply out of love for her family.”
  
 “If we went to the Chu Sect, she would be placed under constant surveillance. They would never stop bothering her and she would have to work constantly on the herb gardens, exhausting her mental and physical state every day.”
  
 A sad look came over Chu Bai’s face. “She... She has aged, son. She used to be so vibrant, so full of life. The stress of draining her Qi from her body every day has harmed her life force. If the Blazing Tiger sect hadn’t given her breaks occasionally, I am sure she would have started losing some of her lifespan.”
  
 Chu Shen grimly watched his father before nodding. “I understand. Before benefits, even brothers are tempted.”
  
 Chu Bai grinned. “I see you have matured on your martial path. It is good to see that my son will not be fooled by some smooth-talking charlatan. Enough of that though, it is time to go see your mom.”
 
 
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 174 - Hi Mom</h1>
  
 Chu Bai led Chu Shen down the mountain. For the next three days they walked through the forests, not following any specific path. As they did, Chu Shen informed his dad of all the wondrous things he had seen and done. He revealed his cultivation level which surprised his dad, especially when he found out that he’d only had 3 years instead of 5. Another thing he had been surprised about was the abduction attempt, but Chu Shen downplayed it so he wasn’t worried.
  
 They talked and talked, sharing their stories. His dad had found out that his mom was being transported to a secret area to recover. He had ambushed the convoy, grabbing his mother and escaping. He had only been able to do this since his element was the space element.
  
 He teleported his mother and himself away from the convoy before the guards could stop him. Since then, they had been on the run constantly. Chu Bai had learned some facial disguise techniques along with an aura masking technique when he was younger which helped them escape.
  
 They had hidden themselves in the woods and built a small hut. Chu Bai would go out with his disguise on and purchase medicine. He would also go out to forage and hunt. Considering his cultivation level, he had no problem with killing the local wild beasts.
  
 Chu Shen smiled while his dad shared his own adventures with him. While not as exciting as his own, they held a certain charm to them. On the third day, they reached a wooden cabin.
  
 Chu Bai laughed and waved his hands. “Welcome to me and your mother's humble abode. I hope you enjoy it! Come, your mother must be anxious to meet you.”
  
 By this time, Chu Bai had removed his disguise, returning to his youthful self. He appeared to be in his mid-thirties, still in his prime. He swung open the door to the house. “Honey, I’m home!”
  
 Sitting there in the middle of the small room was a lovely lady. She had black hair with smooth white skin. She was nearly flawless except for the streak of white that ran down the side of her hair. She smiled as she saw Chu Bai come in.
  
 Then, she saw Chu Shen. She slowly stood up. With carefully measured steps she walked over. She reached a hand up and brushed a lock of Chu Shen’s hair out of his face. “Son. Is that really you?” She whispered softly.
  
 Chu Shen smiled at her, tears starting to form. He engulfed her in a hug. “It’s really me, Mom, it’s really me.”
  
 The woman smiled over his shoulder, tears glistening in her eyes. “Oh, Son.”
  
 Chu Bai watched from the side for a while before coming over, joining them in the hug. He leaned over and whispered in her ear. “I told you I would bring our son home, Lai’er.”
  
 Chu Lai smiled at him through her tears. “I never doubted you.”
  
 After they hugged, they separated and sat down on some chairs. Because they only had two chairs, Chu Lai made another one using her wood domain. A green glow covered her palms before a piece of wood emerged from them. The wood started to expand rapidly before forming a chair identical to the other ones in the room.
  
 Chu Shen had watched open mouthed as it formed. To think the wood element was this magical! Chu Shen marveled at the chair as he sat down. “I wonder just how I was able to have two parents with such rare elements,” he asked as he sat down.
  
 Chu Lai smiled. “Well, elements can be inherited. Sometimes, if the elements of the parents are compatible, one can gain a mixed element. Like me, my parents’ elements were water and earth. Somehow they combined to create me, a wood element.”
  
 Chu Shen was stunned at this. “I had no idea that could happen.”
  
 Chu Bai nodded. “It is the reason why rare elements are sought after and some sects only accept disciples with certain elements. They are either hoping that element would be passed down or that they could create a rare element through breeding.”
  
 Chu Shen shrugged. “Well, that’s all well and good. So Dad, what do you want me to do? What can I do to let you live lives of peace like you want?”
  
 Chu Bai sighed. “There is no easy answer, Son. No matter who it is, so long as anyone knows she has the wood element, they will not rest until she is under their control.”
  
 “There are only three solutions that I can think of. One, we can fend off all the sects so that they can’t harm us. I know we can’t do that though, we aren’t strong enough. Two, we can kill everyone that knows. Again, we aren’t strong enough. Or three, we can continue to hide.”
  
 Chu Shen suddenly realized something. “Dad, you remember I told you about the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion right? That it can travel to different dimensions? Well, what if I took you to one of the other dimensions?”
  
 The more Chu Shen thought of it, the better the idea became. “The Pavilion leaves in the next four days, we can hitch a ride with it when it does.”
  
 Chu Bai shook his head. “No, we can’t. We can’t risk being spotted by the Blazing Tiger sect. You told me they attacked you, they know you’re a student of the Majestic Sword Academy. They are surely staking out the school by now. We’d be found out for sure.”
  
 Chu Shen smiled. “I have the Chains of Transportation. You can use those to go with the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. That way you won’t be spotted.”
  
 Chu Lai smiled softly. “Honey, we can go. Let us experience what our son has gone through to become stronger. It will be a wonderful time, I’m sure.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “Yes, it’ll be perfect.”
 
  
 Chu Bai threw up his hands. “I give, I give. We’ll go. Anyways Son, since you’re here, let’s go ahead and have a feast. I’ll go hunt a deer and we can enjoy ourselves.”
 
  
 Chu Shen grinned. “Alright then. Maybe I can join you?”
  
 Chu Bai shook his head. “Nah. We spent twelve years together, spend some time bonding with your mother. She hasn’t seen you all this time, so get to know her.”
  
 Chu Bai opened the door waving back at them. His smile froze before he suddenly coughed, a mouthful of blood coming out. He looked down at his chest where a sword was now sticking out.
  
 “Heh. Finally caught you.”
 
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 175 - Run</h1>
  
 Chu Bai stared down at his chest, dumbfounded at the sight of the sword sticking out. “DAAAADDD!!!!!” Chu Shen yelled.
  
 The sword in Chu Bai’s chest was flung sideways, ripping open a gaping wound in his chest as it did so. Chu Bai slowly fell, crumpling to the floor. Behind him stood a man in black robes, a bloodied sword held in his hand. He flicked the sword, splattering blood on the ground.
  
 He bowed. “I am very sorry about the mess, Chu Lai. I didn’t want to hurt your husband, truly, I didn’t.” The man became upright again. “Unfortunately though, you needed to be punished. Of course, we still need something to threaten you with. Luckily, we now have your son.”
  
 He turned towards Chu Shen. “Surrender boy, and you can avoid your father’s fate.”
  
 Chu Shen had his hands balled up, his body trembling with rage. “Who is this, Mom?” He forced out of clenched teeth.
  
 Chu Lai had tears streaming down her face but managed to answer Chu Shen, her voice choked up. “He is Gu Don, an elder of the Blazing Tiger Sect. Wind element, World stage.”
  
 Chu Shen relaxed his fists. “Alright then, I should be able to kill him.”
  
 Gu Don stared at Chu Shen. “What? Boy, didn’t you hear your mother? I’m at the World stage.” Qi swirled around him, creating a vortex of wind. It blew the furniture up against the wall and forced his mom backwards. Chu Shen’s hair swirled with the wind but his body didn’t move an inch.
  
 Chu Shen grinned ferociously. “Hehe. World stage? Who cares? I’m also at the World stage.”
  
 Gu Don sighed. “Why does everyone like to boast? Fine, boy. I just need you alive, it doesn’t matter in what condition I drag you back to the sect. I’m sure they can keep you alive even if you are missing a few limbs.”
  
 The wind suddenly surged in power. The wooden house was ripped to shreds. Chu Bai’s body was flung with the wind, disappearing from sight. A huge tornado formed with Gu Don at the center. “You see this, boy? This is the true power of the World stage!”
  
 Gu Don formed miniature wind blades inside his wind domain. With a slash of his sword, the wind blades surged outwards towards Chu Shen. By using only ten percent of my power, I should be able to disable him and not kill him. Hmph. That arrogant brat, daring to claim he was my equal.
  
 Chu Shen glared at Gu Don, his body standing ramrod straight. He wasn’t moved at all even though his body was buffeted by the strong winds summoned by Gu Don’s wind domain. The wind blades flew straight at Chu Shen.
  
 He didn’t move, allowing the wind blades to hit him. The wind blades struck Chu Shen, smashing into his body. They cut his clothes to ribbons but his body was unharmed. Gu Don was stunned. How could the human body withstand such power? He didn’t even use Qi to protect his body!
  
 Gray Qi surged forth from Chu Shen’s body. When it touched Gu Don’s domain, the tornado started to collapse. When that happened, Gu Don started to realize that Chu Shen hadn’t been bragging.
  
 ‘This brat. He really is at the World stage. I could probably take him on, but it would be hard to subdue him without killing him. It looks like I’ll have to get reinforcements.’
  
 Gu Don used his wind element to quickly fly next to Chu Lai. He slapped her on the back, a round marking appearing on it. “Hehe. It seems you weren’t lying brat, you really could kill me. Unfortunately, I won’t give you the chance. With this wind-seeking rune, no matter how far your mom runs, I can find you.”
  
 Gu Don flew upwards. He waved at Chu Shen. “I’ll see you shortly, very shortly.”
  
 Chu Shen shot forward, a sonic boom echoing behind him. Gu Don, who had thought he had escaped, looked backwards when he heard the noise. He saw Chu Shen hurtling through the air towards him.
  
 A small sliver of fear wormed its way into Gu Don’s mind. This brat was even faster than him. To be faster than someone with the wind element, what kind of monster was this? He swooped downwards, attempting to lose Chu Shen.
  
 A circle of light appeared under Chu Shen’s feet. Pushing off it, he flipped himself upside down. Pushing off another circle of light, Chu Shen shot downwards, straight at Gu Don. His hammer appeared in his hand, swinging straight at Gu Don’s head.
  
 Gu Don was now frightened. His domain formed around him in an instant, buffeting Chu Shen with strong winds and flinging him off course. He still attempted to hit Gu Don, lashing out with his hammer. A humming sound could be heard as the hammer vibrated millions of times in a second.
  
 Gu Don hurriedly dodged and continued to flee. Chu Shen projected his own domain around himself and once again started running after him. Gu Don slowed significantly when Chu Shen’s domain covered him.
  
 Realizing that he couldn’t flee anymore with his speed so drastically reduced, Gu Don turned back to face Chu Shen. Swinging his sword, a vast windblade shot forward at Chu Shen. Before it could reach him, however, the windblade wavered and then dissolved.
  
 Gu Don was now panicking. None of his moves were working! A hammer swung at his body, forcing Gu Don to block with his sword. The blow flung Gu Don away. The vibrations numbed his arm and disintegrated his sword. Shaking his hand, Gu Don realized he was now out of the domain of Chu Shen.
  
 He now realized his mistake. Coating himself in wind, Gu Don raised his speed to the maximum. Several booms echoed out behind him as he flew quickly away. Chu Shen started to chase after him but realized quickly that he couldn’t reach him.
  
 Turning back, he landed beside his mom. His mom had reached Chu Bai’s body and was kneeling beside it. Chu Shen kneeled beside him as well. Crying, he placed his head on his dad’s bloody chest.
  
 His mom placed a hand on his shoulder reassuringly as she cried as well. After a couple minutes, Chu Shen turned towards her. “Why? Why didn’t you help? Aren’t you also at the World stage?” He angrily asked.
  
 Chu Lai shook her head as she answered bitterly. “No, son. Unfortunately, they placed a seal on me. Unless the Blazing Tiger Sect allows it, I am restricted to the Martial Warrior stage. I can fight, but I am useless when it reaches fights of this level.”
  
 Chu Shen sighed before sobbing. “I’m sorry, Mom. I’m just, I’m just so lost, so angry. “
  
 Chu Lai nodded and cradled him. “I understand, baby. I understand.”

  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 176 - Hiding</h1>
  
 After Chu Shen and his mom grieved, they buried Chu Bai. Together they spent an entire day before Chu Bai’s grave. Chu Lai sighed before slowly getting up from her pose on the ground. “Remember to always be vigilant, son. Even the strongest warrior can be ambushed. If your father wasn’t taken by surprise, that man wouldn’t have been able to hurt him at all.”
 
  
 Chu Shen got up as well. “I know, Mom. Anyway, let me take you back to the Majestic Sword Academy. The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion will be disappearing in three days. I believe I can hide you at the school until then. Go ahead and put this on.” He handed her a Chain of Transportation.
  
 Chu Lai put it on. “I believe that the Blazing Tiger sect shouldn’t be able to find us in three days. Let’s go then.”
  
 Chu Shen pulled out a communication device. “Hey Lucas, mind teleporting over here? I’ve got my mom here and we need a fast ride to the academy.”
  
 Lucas’ voice came from the coin sized communicator with a slight metallic tinge to it. “Don’t worry, Chu Shen. I’ll be there in about five minutes. I’ve got to stop forging a weapon here so I can get you.”
  
 Chu Lai looked puzzled. “How is he going to get here so fast?”
  
 Chu Shen smiled. “Don’t worry Mom, you’ll understand soon enough.”
  
 After a little while, Lucas appeared in front of them. He looked at Chu Lai with surprise. “Oh? Is this your mother Chu Shen?”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “Yep. Mind taking us back to the Majestic Sword Academy?”
  
 Chu Lai was surprised but she wasn’t shocked. Finally, she asked curiously. “You can teleport, so you must have the space element. However, I wasn’t aware that one could teleport another person as well. My husband never could, at least. Also, the Majestic Sword Academy has a spatial barrier. If I remember correctly, you should be able to teleport out but not in without the proper authorization.”
  
 Lucas smiled. “Well, my ‘element’ is a bit unique. It’s the first I’ve heard of a spatial barrier, but I also haven’t tried to teleport straight to Majestic Sword Academy. Just to be on the safe side, we’ll teleport where we first did, right outside the academy.”
  
 They disappeared right after Lucas finished and then reappeared at the bottom of the mountain. Chu Lai gasped, now truly shocked at the change. “H-h-how?! How strong are you?!”
 
  
 Lucas grinned. “I’m definitely stronger than you can imagine.”
  
 Lucas turned towards Chu Shen. “So, did you get to meet your Dad?”
  
 Chu Shen shook his head sadly. “The Blazing Tiger Sect killed him. They were going to capture me and threaten to kill me to force my mom to work for them. Fortunately they didn’t realize how strong I was. They managed to escape so they’re going to be coming after us soon.”
  
 Lucas grimaced. “I’m sorry Chu Shen, I didn’t know.”
  
 Chu Shen sighed before shaking his head. “Don’t worry, I don’t blame you for anything. So, we know that the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion will be going to your dimension next. I was thinking that we could hide my mom there somewhere to protect her.”
  
 Lucas adopted a thoughtful look and started to slowly nod. “Yeah, I think we can arrange that. At the very least, she can live on a spaceship for a little while.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “Thanks, that’ll be really helpful.” He turned towards his mom. “I’ll take you to my house and you can stay there for the next three days. After that, you can depart with the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.”
  
 …………………………………….
  
 Gu Don quickly fled away from Chu Shen. After two hours of continuous flying, he finally slowed. Looking back, he realized that no one was following him. Sighing, he landed and braced himself against a tree.
  
 This situation is getting out of control. That brat is at the World stage and has an element that allows him to disperse other people's domains. I don’t know what it is, but this is serious. We need that wood element woman, we must have her! If we can’t, then we must at least make sure no one else can.
  
 Thinking along these lines, Gu Don grit his teeth and flew off again.
  
 ………………………………………..
  
 Three days later, Chu Shen stood outside with his mom. “Alright Mom, we’ll be surrounded by a transparent barrier. Then we’ll disappear and reappear in a different dimension. Lucas will be able to help us get to a place for you to stay. That way you’ll be safe. Then I’ll train until I can come back and kill the Blazing Tiger Sect.”
  
 Chu Lai nodded. “Okay, Son. I trust you.”
  
 They had spent the last three days simply talking with each other and enjoying each other’s presence. Chu Shen had made sure that Chu Lai created a charm for the Chains of Transportation.
  
 He didn’t want his mom to be stuck like he had been. He also told her about how the charms worked and told her to make sure to create one whenever she went to different dimensions, not that he believed that she would be there long enough. Now it was time for the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion to leave.
  
 A barrier appeared once again around Chu Shen and then around Chu Lai. They disappeared from this dimension. Aslo suddenly woke up as the barrier appeared around him. Chrissa stopped eating her lunch as her barrier appeared. Lucas though, he was expecting it.
  
 He looked up at the sky as the barrier appeared. “Dad. I’m finally coming home.”
  
 With Lucas’ thoughts filled with seeing Xentus Viri again[...?]
  
 …………………………………………
  
 Gu Don was traveling swiftly with three elders of the Blazing Tiger Sect when he suddenly paused. The elder on the left frowned. He carried a greatsword as big as he was. “What is it, Gu Don?”
  
 Gu Don looked puzzled. “I, I’m not sure, Great Elder. My connection with the wind-seeking rune has disappeared.”
  
 “What!? I thought you said nothing could break the connection! Only someone who was in the Universe realm would be able to forcefully destroy it.”
  
 Gu Don shook his head. “No, it was not destroyed. I would have been able to sense it. The connection was lost. The only way I can think of this happening would be if the wood element woman entered a pocket dimension. Only in this way would she be able to lose my wind-seeking rune. Even if she was killed, the wind-seeking rune would still guide us to her body.”
  
 The great elder sighed. “Tell me that you can at least find out her last known location.”
 
  
 Gu Don shook his head. “No. I only know in what direction to head. Finding out the exact location is beyond my capabilities.”
  
 The great elder looked out at the sky. “We can only hope to find her later. If we do not, then the balance of power will shift in the martial world.”
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 177 - Back Again</h1>
  
 Chu Shen appeared suddenly in the middle of downtown. Apparently they had rebuilt the town after the bug invasion. Luckily it was in the middle of the business day so no one was around. His mom, Lucas, Aslo, and Chrissa had appeared with him and were looking around.
  
 Lucas suddenly grinned. “Hey, Chu Shen. I’ve connected with the tachyon comm system from Sparta. This is indeed my dimension.”
  
 Chu Shen grinned as well. “Welcome home, Lucas.”
  
 Lucas shook his head. “I still have a way to go before I actually get home. Alright, let’s get to the edge of town where I can summon the spaceship. Then we can make our way to the nearest jump gate and teleport to Sparta.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. He turned to face everyone. “Alright guys, you heard Lucas. We’re going to the edge of town before we go to Lucas’ hometown. Come on, follow us.” He grabbed his mom’s hand. “Don’t worry Mom, just stick with us and we’ll keep you safe.”
  
 Chu Lai nodded and then followed Chu Shen as they ran towards the edge of town. The crowded buildings started to give way to trees and grass until soon there were no houses for a mile either way on the road. Lucas surveyed the area quickly with his cybernetic eyes before giving it the go ahead.
  
 He teleported his spaceship out of his pocket dimension. Chu Lai looked at the metal spaceship in awe. “What is this thing? I’ve never seen anything like it before.”
 
  
 Chu Shen smiled. “Lucas is a dear friend of mine, but he also comes from a unique dimension. Here, the people do not cultivate. Instead, they use artifacts to manipulate Qi and fight. They’re masters in the creation of tools and Lucas’ body is actually an artifact.”
  
 Chu Lai looked at Lucas stunned. “Is this true?”
  
 Lucas smiled and popped open a panel on his arm, revealing the internal mechanisms. “It’s true. We call people like me cyborgs; we’re people that augment our body with artifacts. We even create artifacts that mimic humans that we call androids.”
 
  
 Chu Lai shook her head. “What a weird place this is.”
 
  
 Chu Lai followed everyone as they entered Lucas’ ship. “It really is weird, Mom. Remember that no one in this dimension knows how to cultivate, they don’t have the strength we do. Just try and act like a mortal for now.” Chu Shen tried to guide his mom as they strapped themselves into the chairs in the command center.
  
 The viewscreen showed the ground outside. With a rumble, the spaceship lifted off the ground and flew up into space. Chu Lai gasped as she saw the viewscreen transition between the blue sky to starry space. “What is this? I’ve never heard of anything like it.”
  
 Chu Shen grinned. “There are planets that contain continents. We actually live on a planet ourselves. Between the planets is vast amounts of space and stars. The artifact we’re on can travel in the space between planets, allowing us to visit other worlds. We’re actually going to Lucas’ home planet right now.”
  
 Lucas started searching the GalacticNet, the universe's version of the Internet. Finding the coordinates he needed, he activated the hyperdrive. With a flash, they disappeared and reappeared some distance from a transfer station.
  
 Upon arrival, Lucas activated the comm system. “This is Lucas, the captain of the spaceship Rogue. I would like to request usage of the transfer station, medium-ship size to Sparta please.”
 
  
 A bored voice came from the comm system. “That will be 300 credits. Please send over the authorization code and join the line.”
  
 Lucas smirked. “Authorization code is QX-102-LUC-WEB-SPA.”
  
 There was a pause. “I’m sorry if I offended you in anyway sir. Would you like priority service sir?”
 
  
 Lucas nodded triumphantly. “Of course, please allow us through the transfer portal as soon as possible.”
  
 “You can go through immediately. Pleasant journey, sir.”
  
 “Thank you.”
  
 The station operator let out a breath of relief  and took off his headphones. The man next to him had overheard his conversation and raised an eyebrow. “Why did you let them through like that? Even if they are your friends, breaking regulation like that can get you fired.”
  
 The station operator said nothing and only swiveled his screen to face his coworker. Displayed on the screen was Lucas’ activation code. Bright red letters were in the middle of the screen flashing. The man gasped as he saw the what the letters said.
  
 Those bright red letters flashed once more on the screen, revealing their message. ‘Executive Authorization: Level 10.’
  
 The spaceship appeared in front of the magnificent planet that was Sparta.  Lucas grinned as he saw his homeworld once more. “I’m home. I’m really home.” He piloted the spaceship towards the moon where he had lived with Xentus Viri and Chu Shen.
  
 Using his authorization codes, he bypassed Sparta’s security codes and the installation. Landing his ship on the moon, Lucas took a deep breath. He smirked after he did though. He didn’t need to breathe, but it still relaxed him. Guess there was no escaping the fact that he was truly human at one point in time.
  
 Lucas disembarked from the ship before slowly walking towards the facility. Chu Shen understood his friend’s feelings and blocked everyone else from getting off the ship.
  
 Aslo spoke angrily. “Why aren’t we getting off? I thought we were going to stay here with Lucas for a while.”
  
 Chu Shen shook his head. “We can’t get off now. Lucas has been gone from his home for years and his father must think him dead by now.”
  
 He looked over his shoulder as Lucas walked into the research facility. “This is a private moment for Lucas. We need to respect his wishes for a while longer. He’ll come get us when he’s ready.”
 
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 178 - Xentus Viri… Again</h1>
  
 Xentus Viri pounded down on the control panel in front of him. Sparks flew as he easily crushed the reinforced metal supporting the panel. “ARRGGHHH!!! WHY CAN’T I FIGURE IT OUT!!!!”
 
  
 A calm synthetic voice came from the speaker nearby. “That is because the data of the anomaly is insufficient for research purposes.”
  
 He picked up a piece of metal and threw it at the speaker. With a loud crash, it made a hole in the wall where the speaker had previously been attached. “I DON’T NEED SOME STUPID COMPUTER TO TELL ME THAT!!”
  
 Xentus Viri frustratedly threw himself down in a nearby chair. Covering his mouth, he looked at a complicated diagram in front of him. As he stared, a tear trickled down his cheek.
  
 It had been six years since Lucas had disappeared from his laboratory. When he found out they were missing, Xentus Viri went on a rampage. He immediately gathered as much data as he could from the various scientific instruments that had been active when they disappeared.
 
 Unfortunately, the data collected was far from enough to even attempt recreating the anomaly. The only thing he could make out was the fact that it was some kind of controlled wormhole that had opened up in his shop.
  
 Based on the fact that it couldn’t be a natural phenomena, Xentus Viri desperately searched throughout the entire known universe for some clue. He tried looking for various enemy powerhouses or terrorist organizations, hoping beyond hope that they had kidnapped Lucas somehow.
  
 For three years he attempted this. Finally, he had to conclude that Lucas wasn’t being held hostage and that something else had happened. That whoever took him had some other purpose.
  
 Xentus Viri had been avoiding another possibility for some time and he was finally forced to believe that it was true. That his experiments with black holes had caused the phenomena that had taken Lucas away from him. Upon coming to this conclusion, he was devoured by the guilt that he had been the one to cause this.
  
 For the next four years, he attempted to recreate everything that he had done. He tried and tried and tried to create another phenomena just like the one that had taken Lucas away. Again and again he faced failure.
  
 In one of the failures, the black hole suddenly expanded by a tenth of an inch. The increase in gravity exceeded his shields and caused half his lab to be destroyed. Luckily, he had failsafes that included shutting down the black hole and teleporting himself to Sparta.
  
 Ignoring the risk though, Xentus Viri continued working. If he had been called a madman before, he had truly become a madman now. Due to his eccentric personality, the Spartan council members hadn’t realized anything was wrong yet. Rumors had started though, and they were becoming suspicious.
  
 If he was right, then he was working on borrowed time. Already Xentus Viri had heard of a proposal by one of the council members to ask for a record of all the experiments that he had done for the past couple years. Luckily, the other council members rejected the proposal, but the fact that some were doubting him was impossible to ignore now.
  
 Xentus Viri had truly fallen into despair. He had tried everything he could think of to get his son back and nothing had worked so far. He had failed. He failed his adopted son. He truly was the worst father possible.
  
 As he laid in his chair, tears pouring from his eyes, he heard a sound. Tap, tap, tap. Tap, tap, tap. It was the sound of someone walking down the hallway. Upon hearing it, Xentus Viri straightened up and wiped the tears from his eyes. In a matter of seconds, he was back to the gruff inventor everyone came to expect.
  
 The door to his lab opened, revealing a large muscular man. Xentus Viri glared at the man. “What is the meaning of this!? Out, get out, you oversized monkey!”
  
 The muscular man looked at Xentus Viri with tender eyes. “Dad.”
  
 Xentus Viri, who had started pushing the overgrown ape out of his lab stopped. He looked up at the man. “That’s Lucas’ voice.” He said in a calm voice. “Where did you get the code for it? I designed it myself.”
  
 The man paused before grabbing Xentus Viri in a bearhug. “I missed you so much, Dad!”
 
  
 Xentus Viri struggled but couldn’t break out of the man’s arms. “Let GO of me, you monkey!”
  
 After a little while the man put Xentus Viri down. He glared at the man. “Lucas has been gone for seven years. Why would I believe that you are him? You don’t even look like him.”
  
 The man looked down at his body before laughing. “Sorry Dad, I just forgot. My original body was destroyed but I built my own afterwards. Here, you can check out my brainbox, that should prove it.”
  
 The man’s chest split open, revealing a black box. Xentus Viri gasped as he saw the familiar piece of hardware. Reaching down he took the black box, gently unplugging some of the wires that lead out of the back of the black box. Hooking it up to a console, he ran some diagnostics.
  
 After a minute, Xentus Viri calmly plugged the brainbox back into the hulking shell. The robotic body that had slumped over stood upright now that it had someone back in control. Xentus Viri took two steps forward before wrapping the man in a bear hug.
  
 “Lucas, oh, Lucas. I missed you so much. I missed you, Son.” Tears trickled down his face. Lucas merely smiled sadly. Once more, he cursed himself for not putting tear ducts in his body.
  
 After some time, Xentus Viri calmed down. “What happened, Lucas?! Where did you go, what have you been doing? Are you alright, did anything happen? You said your original body was destroyed, how did that happen?”
  
 Lucas smiled. “Just as curious. I guess we both have that in common, huh? Anyways Dad, let me explain quickly.”
  
 “Chu Shen is from a different dimension. He gained a mysterious artifact that randomly takes him to other dimensions. He came to ours on accident and when he disappeared from ours he took me along on accident. He knows how to control it better now so I can stay here instead of going off again.”
  
 “The other dimensions are so weird, and the people in almost every other dimension can manipulate energy with their minds. While I was there, I got into a fight that destroyed my original body. Luckily, Chu Shen took a fabricator and I was able to make another body using that.”
  
 Xentus Viri rocked backwards at the immense info Lucas gave him. His eyes narrowed as he focused on the important part of the story.
  
 “So, Chu Shen is the one to blame for taking you away?”
  
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 179 - Rest</h1>
  
 Lucas paused. “Well, uh, no. Not exactly. Anyways. I had so much fun exploring and I’ve had so many new ideas. I also brought my friends over. Chu Shen is trying to hide his mother from a very powerful organization that is trying to kidnap her.”
  
 Xentus Viri sneered. “Serves him right. Kidnapping my son, only to have his mother kidnapped. Good for him.”
  
 Lucas stared. “He’s my friend, a good friend. He’s saved my life before and stuck with me through thick and thin.”
  
 Xentus Viri shrugged. “That doesn’t make him my friend.”
  
 Lucas groaned. “Daadd!”
  
 Xentus Viri sighed. “Alright fine. I won’t make things difficult for him while he’s here, okay?”
  
 Lucas nodded. “Thanks, Dad.”
  
 Xentus Viri blushed before looking away. “Shut up. Go bring them in so I can get back to work. Right now I’m trying to run experiments on manipulating black holes at range.”
  
 Lucas grinned. “Same old thing, huh? Anyways, I’ll show them to some spare rooms we have.”
 
  
 He immediately ran out of the room, eager to show his friends around the base. Xentus Viri sighed and fell into his chair. He stared up at the ceiling. “How much you’ve grown over the years, Lucas. How much you’ve grown.” A tear trickled slowly down his cheek.
  
 ……………………………………………..
  
 Meanwhile, Chu Shen came out of the ship coughing. He bent over, gasping for breath. Smoke billowed out of the ship’s hatch behind him. Everyone else was also desperately trying to breath.
  
 Whirling, Chu Shen grabbed Aslo by his shirt. “What the heck!”
  
 Aslo threw up his hands. “I’m sorry, okay? It wasn’t my fault the fireball fell. I was just juggling to keep from being bored.”
 
  
 “Being bored is not an excuse to juggle fireballs! Those things are dangerous! You’re abusing your power! Don’t you know that plastic emits noxious and poisonous fumes when caught on fire?” Chu Shen was about ready to strangle Aslo right now.
  
 Chrissa sighed before closing her eyes. The wind slowly picked up before blowing into the ship. The smoke slowly withdrew from the ship, causing a huge column of smoke to billow upwards. “I’ve put out the fire and it shouldn’t smell bad anymore.”
  
 Chu Shen sighed before putting Aslo down. “Fine. You have to explain to Lucas though.”
  
 “Explain what to me?” Chu Shen jumped and turned around. Right behind him was Lucas. “Someone want to explain why there’s smoke coming from my ship?”
  
 Chu Shen pushed Aslo forward. “He does.”
  
 Aslo glared at Chu Shen before facing Lucas. “Well, you see... I might have accidentally dropped a fireball I was juggling onto your chair. Then it caught on fire and filled the whole plane with smoke and then- Ugh!”
  
 Aslo was looking around, studying the surroundings as he spoke. That was the reason he missed Lucas’ move as he punched Aslo right in the gut. He fell to the ground wheezing. “Hmph. I’ll replace the chair afterwards. Anyways, come on in everyone. I’ll show you to your rooms.”
 
  
 He left Aslo on the ground before taking everyone inside. Xentus Viri was an eccentric scientist that didn’t enjoy having company. However, one must not forget his identity as the head scientist of Sparta.
  
 While it wouldn’t happen often, sometimes important visitors would come to his lab, like the Admiral or different council members. As a result, several luxurious guest bedrooms were kept on base and maintained by robots. During his stay, Chu Shen had slept in one of these rooms before.
  
 Chu Shen resettled into his old room while everyone else was shown to their new bedrooms. Afterwards, he went to go find Xentus Viri. He found him staring off into space. Literally. He had a hand-held telescope out and was looking up at one of the stars trying to study it.
  
 Chu Shen tapped the wall nearby. Xentus Viri lowered the telescope before turning to look at Chu Shen. He threw the telescope at him. Reaching up, Chu Shen grabbed the telescope easily.
  
 “Tch.” Xentus Viri turned back to the viewing window. “I have mixed feelings about you. You became the first friend Lucas ever had, and allowed him to make two new friends as well. You took him away from me for eight years, and then you brought him back. I don’t know how to treat you.”
  
 Chu Shen shrugged. “I took him away on accident, during a moment of forgetfulness. I’m sorry about that. To me and Lucas, it has barely been three years since we left you, so don’t think he’s been missing you for a long time because he hasn’t been away that long at all.”
  
 Xentus Viri nodded. “I know that. He told me all about it. He introduced me to that power of yours, the power of the soul. Lucas gave me a beast core and I’ve looked over it many times. I believe it belongs to a power in some sort of other dimension, not unlike the hyperspace we use to travel.”
  
 He pointed at Chu Shen. “I’m actually quite irritated at you. You called these places you to go to dimensions when that’s not true. They’re actually alternate universes, from the string theory. I would have thought that being here you would have learned that, but I guess not.”
  
 Chu Shen shrugged. “Well, I never got to the theoretical parts of the education modules. I was busy learning the things you’d proven true, the facts instead of the theories. I wasn’t sure how long I had here after all.”
  
 Xentus Viri sighed. “It makes sense, I guess. Anyways, Lucas informed me about the different power levels of your worlds. I assume you’ll be training so you can protect your mom when you go back to your universe?”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “Yeah.”
  
 Xentus Viri nodded. “Alright. In order to get you out of my hair right away, I’ll give you my antimatter reactor. I’ve been using it to open up the black hole generator for a while now. Since I’ll be studying those beast cores for awhile, I won’t need it and I heard having energy available increases your training speed.”
  
 Chu Shen smiled. “Thanks, Xentus Viri. You’ve really helped me out a lot.”

  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 180 - Star Formation</h1>
  
 Chu Shen did not start training right away. Instead, he did what he promised Aslo. He helped Aslo and Chrissa reach the Nature stage. Once Chu Shen helped them form their domains, they started to work on controlling their domains with Chu Shen.
  
 They all focused on expanding their domains and not affecting each other when they expanded their domains. For the next two weeks they worked hard until Chu Shen was finally able to not absorb the Qi from his friends. For the next week, Chu Shen increased his control over his domain.
  
 Finally, both Chu Shen and Master Ti Wu were satisfied with the level he had reached. “Alright, stop training, you brat. You’ve done enough. Now it is time for you to reach the Universe realm.”
  
 Chu Shen shrugged. “I don’t see how I’m ready. I mean, what does reaching the Universe realm mean, anyways?”
  
 Master Ti Wu grinned. “Well, I guess we should review the other levels of power first. The Martial realm was all about collecting more energy inside your dantian and opening up your meridians. The Natural realm was about unlocking your element and creating a domain.”
  
 “These are all logical steps, but the Universe realm is not logical. The next step is called soul-searching. The soul is a mysterious thing that can only be grown with unique skills, learning, or fighting. It is directly related to how strong one can become because it allows us to control our Qi.”
  
 “When one reaches the Universe realm though, one evolves their soul to the cosmic level. Upon doing so, one can use their spiritual sense to scan hundreds of miles at a time. One can also observe Qi on the lowest levels, seeing each individual part of Qi.”
  
 “The final part is that one can then assimilate Qi into their soul. When that happens, you can attack another person’s soul. You can interfere with their control of Qi, disabling their abilities if they are weaker than you. At the same time, your ability to control Qi will increase exponentially.”
  
 Chu Shen sighed. “Great, so do we have to do something weird?”
  
 Master Ti Wu shook his head. “Nope. Remember the Void’s Hand? It allowed you to go into your soul a long time ago. Now it is time to go back.”
  
 “Alright, Master. Just let me get to my bed so I don’t have anyone freaking out this time.” Chu Shen ate some lunch before heading to his bedroom. Informing everyone that he was going to be busy for a while and not to disturb him, Chu Shen prepared for his training.
  
 He sat down on his bed in the lotus position. “Master, I’m ready.” After he spoke, his body became limp as his soul left his body.
  
 …………………………….
  
 Chu Shen appeared floating. In front of him was a large sphere of gray energy and all around him was blackness. “W-what? What’s going on!”
  
 Maser Ti Wu appeared beside him. “This is your soul, I told you that.”
 
  
 “It’s so different than the last time I was here. It was just a cave with some materials. Why did it turn into this!”
  
 Master Ti Wu sighed. “Because your soul changes. When you create your domain, your soul takes on its appearance. Right now that is the current size of your domain inside your soul.”
  
 “Our goal right now is to create a synthetic star. To become a Cosmic Level cultivator, you must create a galaxy from your energy. To officially do so, create a star in your soul.”
  
 “Condense your domain, make it solid. Right now it is in a gaseous form and very large. Make it smaller.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded and stretched his hand out. The gaseous sphere started to condense. The gray energy slowly started turning darker and darker as it became smaller and smaller.
  
 Chu Shen continued until finally he couldn’t force the sphere to condense any more. Now it was pure black and starting to become hot under the immense pressure. Suddenly the entire thing started to catch on fire.
  
 Master Ti Wu grinned. “This part is called soul blaze. Your soul has finally started to evolve. Try not to pass out.”
  
 As Chu Shen turned towards him in confusion, the star exploded. A wave of immense heat burst outwards. A fierce, scorching pain filled his mind as though his brain was on fire.
  
 Chu Shen collapsed to his knees and clutched his head. Throwing his head back he screamed. “AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!
 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!”
  
 What Chu Shen didn’t see was his soul. When the black sphere exploded, small black dust flew everywhere. A huge black fog covered his entire soul in a thin cloud. The cloud was covered in a black fire, giving off a sinister glow.
  
 Because of the fire, one could barely make out the dust when compared to the blackness of his soul. The fires slowly diminished as did the pain Chu Shen was feeling. Soon, the fires were completely gone.
  
 Chu Shen stood up, his hands on his knees, panting. He finally recovered his breath after a few minutes. Standing up, he whirled around to face Master Ti Wu. “What the heck! What was that?!”
  
 Master Ti Wu shrugged. “Well, it’s called tempering. Just like what you would have gone through when tempering your body. Using pain, you can temper your soul and reach the Celestial realm.”
  
 Chu Shen sighed and rubbed his temple. “I really do hate you. Not even a warning.”
  
 Master Ti Wu knocked him upside the head. “Is that anyway to treat your master?”
  
 Chu Shen shook his head. “I’m grateful, but a warning would be nice.”
 
  
 Master Ti Wu sighed. “No respect these days. Anyways, you haven’t even become a Cosmic Level cultivator yet. You would be considered a half-step at most.”
  
 “In order to become a Cosmic Level cultivator, you must form a black hole. That will be the center of your galaxy. In order to do so, you must continuously create stars and explode them as you just did. You may not have noticed since it’s now scattered, but the energy from your domain has expanded to two times its size.”
  
 “What you need to do now is create another star and then explode it to create more energy. The more times you do so, the stronger your soul becomes. Eventually you will be able to condense your star one step further, creating a black hole. There needs to be some energy left over to create more stars though, so don’t try and rush things.”
  
 Chu Shen sighed. “So I just have to experience a lot of pain, huh.”
  
 Master Ti Wu nodded. “Precisely.”
  
 “This is going to be awful.”
 
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 181 - Black Hole</h1>
  
 “AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!” Chu Shen yelled as twenty stars exploded at once. The flames raged in his soul for the next ten minutes before finally calming down. The entire space was thick with gray dust.
  
 Master Ti Wu observed the phenomenon before nodding. “Alright, you brat. This should be good enough to start your black hole.”
  
 “Go ahead and start condensing the energy in your body right in the center of your soul. Use at least half of the star dust to create a huge star. When it starts to explode, contain the explosion and condense it further into an even smaller state. When it does, the star will collapse into itself and turn into a black hole.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded, panting as he tried to recover. Master Ti Wu glanced at him before sighing. “I guess you can wait until you’re feeling better. You need to do this in top condition, otherwise you could suffer backlash.”
  
 Chu Shen sighed. “Thanks, Master.” For the next thirty minutes, Chu Shen simply relaxed and brought himself up to full strength. Finally, he decided that he was ready.
  
 Holding out his hand, Chu Shen concentrated. The gray mist-like energy particles vibrated before slowly moving. They started to move faster and faster towards the center of Chu Shen’s soul. The energy swirled around a growing ball in the center.
  
 All of the energy compressed before suddenly catching on fire. It formed a huge ball more than fifty times the size of a normal star. After a couple seconds, Chu Shen could sense that the huge star was becoming unstable. It was about to explode.
  
 Chu Shen started to concentrate. The star trembled before it suddenly exploded. What was curious though was that the explosion did not spread. Instead, an invisible sphere seemed to trap the explosion inside it. Slowly the sphere contracted.
  
 The gray energy started becoming darker and darker as it became smaller and smaller. Soon, it was a tenth the size of a normal star. Chu Shen was grimacing as sweat trickled down his brow. A splitting headache threatened to distract him from his mission. Suddenly, the dark energy disappeared.
  
 Chu Shen didn’t see this as his eyes were closed in concentration. He could now sense that the explosion was contained. It was starting to find a balance. After a few seconds more, he relaxed. The energy had finally stabilized
  
 Opening his eyes, he looked at the stabilized energy. There was nothing there. Panicked, he desperately looked around but saw nothing. He closed his eyes and concentrated. The mass of energy was still there. Confused, Chu Shen started thinking. Then he remembered something.
  
 A black hole could not be seen visibly because light couldn’t escape its gravity well. There would simply be an absence of light, pure blackness, where the black hole was. Since his soul was already black in color, it was invisible.  
  
 Chu Shen sighed in relief. At least all the effort wasn’t useless. Master Ti Wu spoke up. “Nice job. Now you have the center of your galaxy. The next step is to create the rest of it.”
  
 “A galaxy is simply a collection of stars. You can think of it as a solar system with stars as planets and the black hole as the sun for a normal solar system. So your next job is to create stars and then put them in orbit around the black hole.”
  
 Chu Shen frowned. “I don’t know how to do that. So far, all the stars have blown up after I made them.”
 
  
 Ti Wu shrugged. “You just have to experiment with them until they’re stable then. I never said it would be easy.”
  
 Chu Shen sighed before getting to work. The energy clumped together in the now familiar process of making a star. Slowly the flames burned but the energy was still chaotic. Chu Shen controlled the energy, not allowing it to explode.
  
 He was forcefully stopping the chances of an explosion but now he was stumped. Then, he recalled the astrophysics lessons that he took on Sparta. He started controlling the inside of the star, making it burn even brighter. The force of the energy burning meant the star started to bulge outwards.
  
 Gathering more energy together, Chu Shen forced it into the outer edge of the star. This increased the star’s mass and gravity. The star started to pull itself towards the center of its body. He added more and more until finally, there was equilibrium.
  
 Letting go of his mental grip on the star, Chu Shen observed it for a while. The star burned bright, not even flickering. It showed no sign of exploding. Master Ti Wu watched dumbfounded.
  
 ‘This brat! How did he discover the principles of Yin and Yang! Using the soft pull of Yin energy that is produced by large objects and the forceful push of Yang energy that stars produce. Just how how did he know about them! It takes geniuses years to learn this principle!’
  
 Master Ti Wu had been looking forward to his disciple bitterly training for at least a year before grasping the basic concept. He was really going to use this to temper his disciple’s will and strength of character, yet he was completely thwarted!
  
 Master Ti Wu finally decided to ask. “You brat. How did you know what to do? Just how did you find a balance for the star to exist?”
  
 Chu Shen turned to Master Ti Wu. “Well master, my time on Sparta helped. They’ve recorded the creation of stars before and using the data from their experiments, I knew what to do.”
  
 “Stars are fueled by nuclear fusion. The energy produced from this pushes the layers of the star outward. At the same time, the star’s internal gravity pulls the layers of the star inward. The denser a star gets, the stronger the nuclear fusion reaction. This causes the star to become hotter and create more energy, pushing the layers of the star outward.”
  
 “When this happens, the star becomes less dense and the nuclear fusion reaction becomes weaker. This causes the star to become cooler and create less energy, allowing the star’s internal gravity to overpower the push of energy and to increase the density of the star. This process is called the solar cycle and the star becomes hotter or cooler depending on what part of the solar cycle it is in.”
  
 Master Ti Wu just stared openmouthed. This was exactly what he had been planning on teaching his disciple! Every person had to learn how do it for himself, there were no shortcuts. There had even been a senior that had recorded the birth of a star in a jade slip so that the disciples of the Void sect could gain inspiration from it. It was one of the prized possessions of the Void Sect, a secret that many would have killed to gain. Yet, his disciple was saying this was taught in Sparta? A place where no one cultivated?
  
 Master Ti Wu was practically spitting up blood. This was unfair!
  
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 182 - Cosmic Stage</h1>
  
 After Chu Shen made the star, he had to put it into a stable orbit around the black hole. Calculating the trajectory of the star relative to the black hole, Chu Shen was able to easily put it into a synchronous orbit. Learning all those physics equations wasn’t a waste after all.
  
 However, Chu Shen quickly realized an issue. He took fifteen minutes to create and place 1 star in orbit. Master Ti Wu told Chu Shen that he needed to make at a minimum 1 billion stars in a stable orbit around the black hole. If he could, 1 trillion stars would be preferable.
  
 Chu Shen recognized why, since 1 billion stars was the minimum to be considered a medium-size galaxy and 1 trillion was the minimum for a large-size galaxy.
  
 He did the math. It would take him over 15 million years to create 1 trillion stars. There had to be some trick that he hadn’t figured out yet. Chu Shen started making stars as fast as possible and was soon able to decrease the time to 7 minutes. It still wasn’t good enough.
  
 Chu Shen decided to take a gamble. He attempted to create 2 stars at once. Surprisingly, it worked. Taking it one step further, Chu Shen made 3 stars the next time. While it was more strenuous to make multiple stars at once, it took the same amount of time it took to make one.
  
 When he started to run low on energy, he would explode a couple dozen stars before continuing. Through constant experimentation, Chu Shen found his limit was 32 stars in 7 minutes.
  
 The more stars he made, the faster his soul grew. As a result of this, the limit was constantly increasing at an exponential rate. Within a week, Chu Shen had formed close to 2 million stars. A month later, the stars reached 60 billion. Exactly 1 month and 5 days after Chu Shen came to Sparta, the stars reached 1 trillion.
  
 Chu Shen admired the marvelous view. Billions of stars slowly circled around an invisible point. An entire galaxy simply hanging in the void right in front of him. A massive star floated past his vision, the heat faintly impacting Chu Shen’s face.
  
 Master Ti Wu grinned. “Very impressive, for a brat. Now it’s time for you to learn how to control your powers. First, we have to leave the Void’s Hand. Then we can start training you.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “Okay, Master. I’m sure the others are concerned by now.”
  
 “Enough, brat. Don’t get sappy on me.” Master Ti Wu waved his hand. Immediately, they disappeared from Chu Shen’s soul.
  
 ……………………………..
  
 Chu Shen freaked everyone out on the base by not emerging from the room containing the antimatter reactor for an entire month. Xentus Viri was surprised because the energy from the reactor was being drained at a visible rate the entire time Chu Shen was in the room.
  
 Chu Lai was the only one that wasn’t worried. To break through required long periods of closed door cultivation. To be isolated from the world for years was a common thing. To her, this was normal and she tried to explain this to everyone else.
  
 Unfortunately, Aslo and Chrissa came from a world where there was no closed door cultivation. Because they couldn’t advance their cultivation stages, they had no concept of why Chu Shen needed to cultivate so long. Ironically, Lucas was the one that understood it best. He compared it to studying for a test. The one that couldn’t cultivate could understand better than the ones that could.
  
 Aslo and Chrissa focused on controlling their domains while Chu Shen was busy. Lucas and Xentus Viri focused on dissecting the beast core and discovering how it worked. They made much progress on discovering how the energy was stored inside it, allowing them to increase the capacity of the power cells by 500%! How the beast core was able to control energy was still a mystery.
  
 The biggest thing was that Xentus Viri sat down with Lucas and started creating a much more powerful body for him. By placing an antimatter reactor inside a subspace, Xentus Viri gave Lucas an almost infinite power source.
  
 Then Xentus Viri put a power transmitter on the antimatter plant and the receiver on the robotic body of Lucas. This way his body didn’t need to contain the energy sources but simply control the energy. The amount of energy he now had available to him was more than 100 times the raw energy Chu Shen had had at the Natural Realm.
  
 As for how he would fare in a fight, that remained to be seen. Undoubtedly, the raw destructive power Lucas now had at is disposal would surely be overwhelming.
  
 Chu Shen stretched as he finally came out of his coma-like state. Going over to the wall, Chu Shen ordered some food from the food synthesizer. Eating a couple hamburgers, Chu Shen calmed down his growling stomach.
  
 Sighing, he leaned backwards. “Alright. Guess it’s time for more training.”
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 183 - Training</h1>
  
 Chu Shen sat down in the lotus position. Right now he was currently on Sparta, in the middle of a forest preserve. People were forbidden from coming here unless they were a researcher.
  
 It was the perfect place to practice without being bothered. Thanks to Xentus Viri pulling some strings, he had been temporarily allowed to enter the preserve. Both him and Aslo had been sent down here, since Master Ti Wu said he would need a partner for his training.
  
 Master Ti Wu appeared above him in his soul form. “Alright, Chu Shen. It’s time for you to start your training. Now, here’s the important thing for you to know. Both Natural and Universe realm cultivators use domains as a basis for power. However, the nature of the domains for these two realms are completely different.
  
 “Natural Realm cultivators use elemental domains. They create a sphere of energy that is made up of their element, such as a sphere of gravity from the earth element, or a sphere of freezing snow for the ice element.
  
 “Universe Realm cultivators use soul domains. Projecting their soul universe into the real world, they can directly attack other cultivator’s souls in this manner.
  
 “In order to do this, you need to concentrate. Focus on your soul, imagine that galaxy you just created. Then, attempt to bring it out. Manifest it into the real world. Make it come to life.”
  
 Chu Shen kept his eyes shut and focused. He recalled the feeling of the stars he had made. How they looked. How they interacted with his Qi. As he recalled these sensations, he felt a connection form, deep inside his mind.
  
 There was a sense of pressure on his brain. Focusing in on that, Chu Shen gave it a mental yank. He felt a resistance. Frustrated, Chu Shen ignored it and continuously pulled on that sense of pressure.
  
 Without warning, the resistance stopped. That sense of pressure flew out of his mind and into the world around him.  Chu Shen opened his eyes as he felt his success. He gasped as he saw the marvelous sight in front of him.
  
 Numerous stars floated in front of him. They rotated slowly as he watched. He recognized the shape of the galaxy floating in front of him. He had spent the last month creating it, after all.
  
 Master Ti Wu frowned as he saw Chu Shen staring at his galaxy. “Alright, brat, that’s enough.” The galaxy disappeared as Chu Shen lost concentration. “You’ve seen your soul domain, so don’t act impressed.
  
 “Now, the next step is to learn how use this in combat. If you can’t use it, then it’s of no use to you at all. First, try and extend your spiritual sense as far as possible.”
  
 Chu Shen closed his eyes and did as he was told. Images of trees and animals appeared in his mind. Then large buildings, people, hover cars, spaceships, oceans, and large rock formations. All of them were picked up his scan.
  
 Chu Shen gasped. “I, I can see! I can see everything! The closest city should be twenty miles away, and yet I can sense it from here!”
  
 Ti Wu shrugged. “Only twenty miles? That’s not impressive at all.”
  
 Chu Shen finally paid attention to Master Ti Wu. “Well. I don’t know how far I can see. It’s just that I know I can see a lot farther than the city I mentioned.”
 
  
 Master Ti Wu nodded. “That’s better. Alright, now it’s Aslo’s turn.”
  
 Aslo had been uncharacteristically quiet, probably because he was warned that if he interrupted them he would be teleported back to the moon. He had been fed up with just training day in and day out. He couldn’t bear to go back to the stuffy facility.
  
 Aslo perked up when he heard his name. “What do you need me to do?”
  
 Master Ti Wu sighed. “When I tell you, just manipulate some Qi. Turn it into a fireball or something.” He turned to Chu Shen. “Now, I want you to see if you can detect anything when he forms the fireball. Go ahead, Aslo.”
  
 Chu Shen stared at Aslo’s hand as fire emerged from his palm, forming a ball of flames. “Did you sense anything?”
 
 Chu Shen shook his head. “No. Nothing seemed different. All I saw was him forming the fireball.”
  
 Master Ti Wu came up behind Chu Shen, and smacked him upside the head. “Stupid brat! You were supposed to use spiritual sense, not your actual eyes! Go again!”
  
 This time, Chu Shen used his spiritual sense. Before the fireball formed, he could sense a thread of energy surging from Aslo. It originated from his head and went into his stomach. Then the energy seemed to grab the mana from his dantian and pushed along an invisible pathway before finally reaching his hand. All of this happened in a millisecond, so fast that you could miss it even if you were looking right at it.
  
 Chu Shen wasn’t an idiot. He immediately realized exactly what it had been. It was Aslo’s soul retrieving Qi from his dantian and then forming a fireball using that Qi.
  
 Master Ti Wu was observing Chu Shen’s face and saw the enlightened look appear on his face. “Good. Alright brat, it seems as though you saw the soul strand like I thought. Now, Aslo, try and do something more powerful.”
  
 Chu Shen had just seen the fireball supplied with energy, but hadn’t seen the spell actually take form. The fireball was simply too small to demonstrate such a thing properly, which was why Master Ti Wu needed it to be more powerful, because it would take more time to prepare.
  
 Aslo nodded, and started chanting the spell for the Apocalypse Flame. The huge ball of fire energy formed in front of him, but Chu Shen saw a different sight. Multiple strands of soul energy flowed from his brain. The strands twined around each other, forming a thick rope.
  
 This thick rope reached Aslo’s dantian and attached itself to a large amount of Qi. It took roughly ten times the amount of Qi as the fireball had. This time, though, the Qi appeared to slow down the rope. It took longer for the Qi to travel and the rope actually separated into its individual strands.
  
 These strands exited Aslo’s body from his arms, chest, and legs. The strands formed a ball shape and deposited their mana into the middle of the rope ball. The strands contained the ball while still remaining attached to Aslo.
  
 Master Ti Wu decided to test Chu Shen. “Alright Aslo, I need you to make your small fireball one more time. Chu Shen, you just need to observe the creation. Tell me when you can see all the parts.”
  
 
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 184 - Soul Jamming</h1>
  
 For the next three hours, Chu Shen practiced looking at fine threads of soul power. He did this by having Aslo create small amounts of fire such as the fireball or a tiny flame. It was similar to trying to watch a fly as it flew past.
  
 The soul threads whizzed through the body. Chu Shen had to concentrate intensely in order to see the soul power. They were also very small. Before, Chu Shen had likened them to a rope. However, their real size was more like a hair. It was exceedingly tedious to look for the hairs without stopping and staring.
  
 Unfortunately, Master Ti Wu didn’t give him time to stop and look. Instead, Chu Shen had to find the threads while running or sparring with Aslo. “The point of this is to train you to find the soul threads even while fighting. Otherwise, it’s meaningless to teach you anything else.”
  
 Finally, Chu Shen had learned how to find even the smallest thread of soul power while fighting Aslo. When that happened, Master Ti Wu decided to move to the second part of the training. “Now, you need to learn how to disrupt the flow of soul energy. First, bring out your soul domain. Find the soul energy inside it.”
  
 Ch Shen concentrated a moment before a galaxy appeared in front of him. Now that he knew what he was looking for, Chu Shen attempted to find it. What he saw astonished him. Each star was filled with soul power! “This, this is incredible!” Chu Shen exclaimed as he came to this realization.
  
 Master Ti Wu nodded. “That is why I had you form so many stars. Each star is a condensed form of soul energy. Only Universe realm cultivators can temper their soul energy in this manner. Now, try and use your soul energy to interfere with Aslo’s. Aslo, go ahead and form a fireball.”
  
 Aslo nodded as he started creating one. Soul energy collected his mana and flowed to his palms. His soul energy created a spherical cage with the mana inside.
  
 Chu Shen didn’t know what to do and panicked. Remembering that the stars were bundles of spirit energy, Chu Shen tried to move one towards Lucas. The star blew up and turned into the grey mist that he had first created the star out of.
  
 Using the grey mist like he used his Qi, Chu Shen created a hammer out of the energy. Manipulating the hammer, Chu Shen was able to fling it at the spherical cage right as it was forming. The spherical cage broke and the mana inside flew out of control.
  
 Aslo had a grin on his face as he started to create a fireball. He could feel the warmth of his mana surging on his hand. For a brief instant, his fire flickered into being. Then, it all went wrong.
  
 The fireball had just formed when Aslo felt his control suddenly slip. The entire mass of energy exploded right above his hand. If it wasn’t for his strong body from being a fighter, he would have burned his hand off. A weak spell such as this fireball wasn’t capable of hurting him, but it did scare him.
  
 He stared at Chu Shen. “Just how did you do that?”
  
 Chu Shen stared back. “Haven’t you been listening? This is the whole point of my training, to interfere with other people’s abilities.”
  
 Aslo shook his head. “I’ve been admiring the view honestly. You two have been talking for so long and it’s been so boring. I just tuned you both out.”
  
 Chu Shen facepalmed. “Well I’m not going to explain it. Just do what Master Ti Wu tells you, alright?”
  
 “Fine.”
  
 Master Ti Wu shook his head. “Listen, brat. You are on the right track, but you’re wrong. The soul energy emitted by your entire galaxy is enough to disrupt any low level attack. If you concentrate that soul energy you can disperse some strong attacks. Blowing up a star isn’t the answer. It’ll be important later, but not now. ”
  
 Chu Shen looked down, ashamed. Master Ti Wu sighed. “Use the energy from the star to recreate it. This should be fairly easy.” Chu Shen did as he was told and the star soon flared back to life.
  
 Chu Shen went back to his training. This time, he tried to sense the energy being emitted from his galaxy. When Aslo tried to form his fireball, he moved his galaxy over Aslo. The mere presence of his soul energy disrupted Aslo’s own. It was like trying to use a squirt gun while being in a whirlpool. It would simply dissolve into the whirlpool’s power.
  
 For the next four hours, Chu Shen constantly disrupted various levels of spells as Lucas went to cast them. Chu Shen learned how to manipulate his galaxy’s energy into concentrated fields that disrupted stronger spells.
  
 By the end of the training, Aslo looked like a mess. His clothes had holes in them, his hair was smoldering and charred. The constant explosions of his spells backfiring had taken a toll on him.
  
 Aslo threw up his hands. “That’s it! I’m not doing this anymore! If you want a punching bag, then ask Lucas! He can’t feel anything anyways!”
  
 Chu Shen shook his head. “Lucas can feel things. Besides, you already helped me this much. The next thing is me disrupting your domain. When I’ve done that, then Master Ti Wu said I’ll have accomplished my training for today.”
  
 Aslo sighed. “Fine, but you owe me.”
  
 Aslo concentrated, releasing a surge of heat from his body. The air around him shimmered as flames appeared around him. From all appearances, Aslo had turned into a giant fireball.
  
 To Chu Shen, there was a different look. Like an explosion, threads of soul energy shot out of Aslo’s body. They carried  with them Aslo’s fire attribute Qi. These threads criss-crossed throughout  his entire domain before seeming to hit an invisible barrier.
  
 Upon hitting this barrier, the threads spread out, creating a wall of threads. An insane amount of soul threads were densely packed along the inside of the barrier. Chu Shen didn’t even know where to begin. Before, he had merely destroyed the containment of Aslo’s spells. This time, he wasn’t sure if it would work.
  
 Chu Shen attempted to use his soul energy to disrupt Lucas’ domain like before. Unfortunately, it didn’t have the desired effect. The soul energy dimmed and lost control over some of the fire Qi. The flames that composed Aslo’s domain light up for a second before dimming. Clearly his universe suppressed Aslo’s domain, but it wasn’t enough to extinguish it.
 
 Chu Shen then recalled what Master Ti Wu had said before. Taking another approach, Chu Shen manipulated the entire galaxy into the middle of Aslo’s domain. He immediately blew up over a million stars at once, causing a massive explosion. This explosion only affected the soul threads and the explosion ripped through them like wooden boards in front of a black belt.
  
 An invisible wind seemed to originate around Aslo. The flames comprising his domain disappeared in a small circle around him. The circle grew rapidly until his entire domain was gone.
  
 The fire energy hadn’t just disappeared, though. Instead, the heat energy shot upwards like smoke from a fire, creating a pillar of fire. Aslo was standing in the middle of his domain, his skin gray from the fire. Chu Shen then started to reform his million stars
  
 Master Ti Wu shook his head. “Using the energy from your destroyed stars is the only way to break a domain. However, only using ten thousand stars would have been enough. You wasted a lot of energy from that move.”
  
 “It appears as though you still need more training.”
 
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 185 - Foundation</h1>
  
 Chu Shen trained for another two hours before calling it quits. During that time, he learned how to properly utilize and control his soul energy. By detonating only one star at a time, Chu Shen learned how big the explosion was.
  
 When the star exploded, a gray energy shot outwards in a sphere around the star. This gray energy was just like acid, corroding the strands of soul energy that composed the domain. It only covered a small part of the domain, though.
  
 Chu Shen exploded one star at a time until he had finally destroyed a thousand stars. The domain slowly dissolved as the stars exploded one after another. The point of this exercise was to discover just how many stars it would take to destroy a domain.
  
 It appeared very weird. The fireball around Aslo slowly disappeared, giving the illusion of a fiery ice cube melting. It was a very confusing image, but an apt one to describe the situation.
  
 Chu Shen found that exploding 2,309 stars one after another destroyed Aslo’s domain. Exploding 1,481 stars at once also destroyed the domain. By having Aslo create domains of varying strength and intensity, Chu Shen was able experiment with how many stars were needed to fully destroy domains.
  
 At the end of the two hours, Chu Shen had advanced a lot. He had made huge strides in learning how much soul energy was needed to dispel domains of various levels. While it wasn’t perfect, Chu Shen was definitely making progress and only made a few low-level mistakes.
  
 Master Ti Wu deemed his efforts acceptable and told him to retire for the rest of the day. Aslo was all too happy to stop being his punching bag and instead decided to stay in the forest, sleeping under the stars.
  
 Chu Shen teleported back to his bedroom and slept. He could have continued on without sleeping, but that would always result in poor results. Meditating was different, since the mind would be in a state similar to sleepwalking, and didn’t require rest.
  
 The next day, it was back to the grinding wheel. For the next couple of hours, Chu Shen continuously trained until he was able to instantly determine the strength of a domain based upon the soul strands present inside it. Then he would use the appropriate amount of stars to destroy it.
  
 In Master Ti Wu’s words, this was training the foundation! What was a foundation? Something that everything to come after would be based on. Even if Chu Shen became a hundred times stronger, with hundreds of galaxies, he would still need to learn how to control his soul energy.
  
 It would be better to learn such things now when he had a guinea pig, er, sparring partner’ of the appropriate strength. If he became too strong, then simply the presence of his universes would cause Aslo’s domain to dissolve.
  
 After five hours, Chu Shen was finally able to master this technique to Master Ti Wu’s standards. “Alright brat, you’ve done enough. Aslo, you’re dismissed. We won’t need you again, so go back to training.”
 
  
 Aslo shook his head. “I think I’ll stay down here for a bit and go back when you’re done training. I just want to explore for a bit longer.”
 
 Master Ti Wu sighed before waving his hand. “Fine, but don’t blame me when you’re lagging behind your own sister.”
  
 He turned to face Chu Shen. “This is the next step for you. I suspect you have guessed it, since I had you training in how to disrupt an elemental domain. Now you must learn how to prevent your own Void Domain from collapsing from a soul attack.
  
 “Recall that the domain is made up of soul strands. When you create your domain, look at the strands in your own domain. Try and fuse soul energy into it and strengthen the bonds. I will disrupt your domain for you.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded before doing as he was told. His domain formed a black fog around him, carried by his soul strands. These strands covered the ground before seeming to hit an invisible barrier.
  
 Chu Shen didn’t spend much time looking at the soul strands that composed his domain. They were just like Asloo’s, only thicker. It must be because he had advanced in his cultivation, while Aslo was still at the Natural Realm.
  
 Chu Shen then saw something spectacular. Multiple galaxies in the shapes of spirals, ellipticals, and abstract images formed in the sky around him. The mere presence of this universe forced Chu Shen to his knees. Aslo, who had run off into the forest nearby, was also affected.
  
 Chu Shen fell to his knees and started shivering. Cold, clammy sweat dripped down his back. It was like he was trying to carry a mountain on his back. The presence of Master Ti Wu’s soul universe, for that was what it was, truly dominated everything around him.
  
 Without question, Chu Shen’s domain broke instantly. Master Ti Wu saw this and frowned. “That’s it? Wow, is your domain weak. I only manifested a million galaxies and this happened. I should have manifested all fifty million and be done with it if you are so weak right now.
 
  
 “You didn’t even do as I asked. You just observed your domain for five minutes without trying to infuse your soul domain into your elemental domain. Go ahead and try to fuse them together to strengthen the soul strands in your domain like I told you a couple minutes ago.”
  
 Chu Shen slowly picked himself off the ground. “I’m sorry, Master. I will not fail you a second time.”
  
 “You better not, brat.”
  
 This time, Chu Shen was prepared. Upon activating his domain, Chu Shen dispersed his entire galaxy of stars. Taking the gray mist, Chu Shen used his mind to make the mist flow and bond to each strand of soul energy that formed his domain.  
  
 This required excellent control over soul energy to attempt, which was exactly what Master Ti Wu had been training Chu Shen in. Since he was able to fully utilize his soul energy, it only took a minute for his domain to be strengthened.
  
 In the physical world, it looked like nothing had happened to his domain. It was still the same gray mist that it was before, even after Chu Shen reinforced the domain’s soul strands. The reason for this was because soul energy was intangible.
  
 Unless one was in the Universe Realm, one would not be able to see soul energy. Instead one would have to rely upon mana. Since Chu Shen didn’t draw more mana, but instead strengthened the soul strands, nothing would be visible.
  
 It was similar to reinforcing the skeleton of a person. While it would undoubtedly make them more resilient to damage, their muscle strength would not increase, and there would be no outward sign.
  
 Master Ti Wu had dismissed his domain in order to let Chu Shen explore his own. Now that he had finally finished his own domain, Master Ti Wu thought it was time to test Chu Shen’s domain out once more.
 
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 186 - Advance!</h1>
  
 Master Ti Wu stood up. “Chu Shen!” he called out.
  
 Chu Shen immediately perked up. “Yes, Master Ti Wu?”
  
 “I believe you’ve lazed around enough. I’m going to test your domain again, get ready.”
  
 Chu Shen became serious. Reinforcing the soul strands that made up his domain, Chu Shen prepared for the immense Universe that Master Ti Wu had summoned last time.
  
 Master Ti Wu closed his eyes before lifting his hands. Chu Shen saw the soul energy emerge from Master Ti Wu’s forehead before condensing into multiple galaxies around him. As Chu Shen watched, the galaxies suddenly enveloped his domain.
  
 Once again the immense pressure came over him. It was similar to being in a heavy gravity, the soul force pressed down on his body. Chu Shen fell to his knees as sweat dripped down his head. The soul strands of his domain shuddered ominously as the pressure threatened to snap them despite Chu Shen’s reinforcements.
  
 Gritting his teeth, Chu Shen forcibly withstood the pressure and kept his composure. His moves were exaggerated and painfully slow, yet he was able to get back on his feet.
  
 Chu Shen simply stood there, sweat dripping from his forehead into his eyes. His hands were clenched and the veins on his neck bulged outwards.  Chu Shen tilted his head back before letting out an aggressive yell, “AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!”
  
 Who, or what, this yell was directed at was unknown. When Chu Shen let out this tremendous sound, he felt as though something had broken inside him. There was a burst of blackness from his body that quickly infested his soul strands.
  
 Suddenly, the pressure disappeared. Instead, Chu Shen felt as though he was being refreshed. It was like he had suddenly been dunked into ice cold water. Everything became crisp and slower. The entire world seemed to finally come into focus.
  
 Chu Shen looked around in awe as Master Ti Wu started to smile. ‘Finally! He has unleashed the true power of the Void.’ He frowned as he felt the energy from his galaxies being drained. ‘Guess I have to teach him how to control it or I’ll be completely absorbed by this brat.’
  
 “Chu Shen! Dismiss your domain, and recall your soul energy. You need to reform your galaxy.”
  
 Chu Shen woke up from his reverie. “Yes, Master.” Chu Shen’s domain was no longer gray, but had turned into a sinister-looking black fog. This fog made others feel as if they would lose their soul if they gazed into it for too long, making them feel like they were looking into a bottomless abyss. It floated towards Chu Shen before being sucked into his dantian.
  
 While Chu Shen was curious about the change, he still needed to reform his galaxy. Composing himself, Chu Shen started to recreate his galaxy. One thing was important to remember, the black hole at the center of his galaxy was the only thing that didn’t dissolve into soul energy.
  
 The reason for this was because the black hole was the foundation of Chu Shen’s domain. The black hole was simply too strong and sturdy. When he tried to dissolve it, the gravity of the black hole would force the energy to remain inside it.
  
 His soul energy was now black as well, making the stars Chu Shen reformed black, as well. Normally the stars were bright points of light set in the darkness of space. Now it was flip-flopped. The stars formed the abyss while the vibrant green of the forest was the backdrop for Chu Shen’s galaxy.
  
 It took thirty minutes for Chu Shen to reform his galaxy. The last time he had reformed it, it had taken fifty minutes so he knew he was improving. When he finished the last star, Chu Shen realized he had some energy left over. Confused, he looked at Master Ti Wu.
  
 Master Ti Wu sighed. “The extra energy is from when your soul just grew as a result of the pressure I put on it.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “I see. So, do you know why my soul energy and Qi turned black?”
  
 Master Ti Wu nodded. “It is what I told you last time. Upon forming a galaxy, one enters the Celestial stage, where you have formed a celestial phenomena. I remember telling you that only upon entering the Celestial stage would you be able to unleash the Void Qi in your body.” He pointed towards Chu Shen. “Well, now you finally have Void Qi.”
  
 Chu Shen just nodded. Then his eyes widened. “What? I, I truly have Void Qi now?!”
  
 Master Ti Wu grinned. “Yes. You see, when I pressured your domain with my soul domain, you pushed back. You tried to withstand my attack with everything you had. This evolved your soul to the next level, causing the dormant Void Qi inside your body to finally be unleashed. The Void Qi quickly expanded and absorbed the Null Qi in your domain, and your soul energy was converted to void energy.”
  
 Chu Shen sat down and simply stared upwards. Finally, he turned back to Master Ti Wu. “So, what does this mean exactly? How does this change my powers.”
  
 Master Ti Wu smirked. “Everything changes, yet everything remains the same. That is how I would describe it. With Void Qi, you can now absorb physical objects and impacts with your void Qi.
  
 “I remember from your time on Sparta that you told me that matter can be turned into energy in a process called nuclear fission, and the opposite through nuclear fusion. Well, Void Qi can initiate nuclear fission and turn the resulting energy into Void Qi.
  
 “Just this alone causes a massive increase in your fighting power. You can now use a simple boulder to replenish a large amount of your power. Your physical body can also be tempered again, increasing your body’s strength ten-fold.
  
 “The devouring power of your Qi has also increased, allowing faster absorption and increased resistance against the world's pressure, allowing your domain to increase in size again. Finally, and most importantly, your soul can now absorb soul energy as a result of the void energy contained inside it.”
  
 “To sum it up, all of your powers will advance to another tier. Yet, the only additional power will be the ability to absorb soul energy. Like I said, everything changes, yet remains the same.”
  
 Chu Shen’s face was practically split in two by this time. “This is great! I can’t wait to start training.”
  
 Master Ti Wu grinned. “Good. You can start by creating another galaxy. You need to create at least fifty million of them with just as many stars as this one has.”
  
 Chu Shen sighed. “I guess I could wait a little longer on training.”
  
 “What was that, you brat!!!”

  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 187 - Cultivate!</h1>
  
 Chu Shen spent the next three months simply advancing his cultivation. He found out from Master Ti Wu that creating more soul energy by exploding stars only worked inside his soul.
  
 That was why when he destroyed his soul domain to reinforce his elemental domain, his soul energy didn’t increase. Master Ti Wu pointed out the reason and afterwards Chu Shen felt incredibly stupid.
  
 When he destroyed a star inside his soul, his soul would have to take the impact of the explosion. That was what caused the pain he felt every time he destroyed a star inside his soul. This tempered his soul, thereby increasing his soul energy.
  
 He hadn’t noticed until Master Ti Wu pointed it out, but he hadn’t felt any pain when he destroyed his galaxy to reinforce his elemental domain. That lack of pain was because the explosion wasn’t inside his soul, and his soul wasn’t tempered as a result of it.
  
 The reasoning behind this was incredibly simple, and Chu Shen was kicking himself for not comprehending it sooner. The lack of pain was a clear clue, yet he had missed it.
  
 With that question out of the way, Chu Shen was able to focus completely on his training. He went back to the base and informed everyone that he was going to be in closed-door cultivation for a long time.
  
 At first, everyone was simply impatient while Chu Shen trained. They simply wanted him to hurry up and finish his training. Yet, when two weeks turned into a month, a month into two, and two months into three, everyone became concerned. Last time, his training only required one month. Yet this time he had already been in training for three times as long.
  
 Chrissa had gotten tips from Master Ti Wu while Chu Shen was training. Her disembodied soul would float around the base occasionally and observe everyone’s progress.
  
 Master Ti Wu was quite satisfied with Chrissa’s progress, as she had mastered her elemental domain and was able to enter her soul through meditation. Under his guidance, Chrissa was able to form a black hole inside her soul. She was finally considered a Cosmic Stage cultivator.
  
 She closed up on the second month of Chu Shen’s training to form her stars. Meditation was inferior in every way to using Void’s Hand to train. She would have to enter a state of intense meditation without interference from the outside world.
  
 If something woke her from the meditation, then she could suffer from backlash and lose control of her budding galaxy as a result. It was also harder to control her soul energy, due to the shallowness of the connection that meditation allowed.
  
 It was similar to comparing the different sleep levels. In REM sleep, one would have deep and realistic dreams while in the other sleep cycles, one would have shallow, unrealistic dreams.
  
 The soul would be a dream, and meditation would be the other sleep cycles. The connection with one's soul would be faint and ghostly when one was in meditation.
  
 As one’s soul energy became stronger, the connection to the soul would become stronger as well. This would eventually create a state similar to the Void’s Hand inflicted upon Chu Shen currently. Unfortunately, Chrissa would have to establish multiple galaxies for such a phenomenon to occur.
  
 Aslo was a hopeless case when it came to meditation. He was simply too energetic and distracted to sit still for the necessary time needed to enter into meditation to begin with.
  
 As a result, Aslo focused on strengthening his domain and perfecting his control over it. Soon, he was able to expand his domain out to a mile. This was far greater than what Chu Shen or Chrissa were able to accomplish, allowing Aslo to gain a somewhat superior attitude when it came to domains.
  
 Lucas, on the other hand, was spending time doing what he loved the most: Inventing.  Xentus Viri had been too busy researching the black holes and searching for Lucas. He didn’t have any time left for the councilors back on Sparta.
  
 As a result, there was an ample amount of projects for him to work on to pass the time. Xentus Viri, for his part, was overjoyed at being able to work with his son once again. It just wasn’t the same if Lucas wasn’t beside him, bothering him with millions of questions.
  
 He could tell that Lucas had changed, though. The designs he came up with were now focused upon practical use. Previously, Lucas designed weird and wondrous creations such as the nanite mech that could transform into anything that one could imagine.
  
 However, the practicality of such a mech was questionable, as nanites were not very sturdy, and the power source for nanites were extremely inefficient. It was simply something that was only suitable to be used in a movie, or to play around in the lab with.
  
 Now Lucas considered if the invention was applicable for warfare and daily use before creating it. If it didn’t meet these criteria, Lucas directly abandoned the project. Over half the projects he previously had worked on were discarded by the revitalized Lucas.
  
 Clearly, Lucas’ trip had matured him. Xentus Viri was both pleased and sad at this discovery. He was glad that Lucas was finally maturing, yet saddened that he missed those moments that had caused Lucas to become the man he was now.
 Chu Shen was able to form all fifty million galaxies, with 1 trillion stars in each one. The exact number of stars was beyond comprehension, and even Chu Shen felt the number of stars was daunting.
  
 Once he finished the fifty millionth galaxy, Chu Shen tried to form another black hole, but he ran into a problem. There wasn’t enough space for another one. In reality, galaxies were trillions upon trillions of miles apart from one another.
  
 This was a result of distribution of stellar mass. One galaxy would hog all the mass around it, leaving a vacuum of stellar dust and junk from previous stars. Without that cosmic junk to form new stars, there would be no galaxies. So a new galaxy would form where there were higher densities of stellar dust and there wasn’t any competition around.
  
 However, that situation did not apply in Chu Shen’s soul. He controlled the galaxies, and he created them, as well. He could create two galaxies less than a mile apart inside his soul. As a result, his internal universe was densely crowded with galaxies.
  
 He found that when he released his soul domain outside his body, the distances between the galaxies and stars increased, making them appear as actual galaxies and not just blobs of light, as they appeared inside his soul currently.
  
 The main point was that Chu Shen’s soul was so packed full of stars that he just didn’t have room for another galaxy.

  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 188 - Return</h1>
  
 Chu Shen turned to Master Ti Wu. “What am I supposed to do now. My soul is stuffed full of galaxies, I can’t fit even a single one inside anymore.”
  
 Master Ti Wu grinned. “Great. You have now recreated the entirety of the heavens inside your soul. In other words, you have become a Heavenly Cultivator. For the next step in your cultivation, you need to do some other things, but that is unimportant right now.
  
 “The current you has enough strength to take revenge on the Blazing Tiger sect. When you first had a conflict with them, I used my spiritual sense to look for them. According to what I could sense, they only have one old man at the Heavens stage, and a couple dozen men at the World stage. There was one or two at the Celestial stage, as well.”
  
 Chu Shen frowned as he realized that this wasn’t going to be easy. Finally, he shrugged. “Alright. With my Void Qi, I should have nothing to fear from a simple Blazing Tiger sect.”
  
 Master Ti Wu grinned. “That’s the spirit! Now, you have the Chains of Transportation, so you should be able to travel back to your own dimension in a matter of seconds. All you need to decide is when you want to go back, and who you wish to take with you.”
  
 Chu Shen grimaced. “Yeah, I guess my friends would want to come. I don’t know if bringing Aslo would be a good idea. Lucas would be nice to have, and Chrissa is actually coming along quite nicely with her training so far.”
  
 Master Ti Wu grimaced as well. “Aslo is a bit of a problem. Anyways, when are you going to travel back?”
  
 Chu Shen frowned. “I don’t know. Let me talk with the rest of the team before we decide what to do.”
  
 Master Ti Wu sighed. “Alright, I guess that’s fair. Anyways, after you wipe out the Blazing Tiger sect, we can move onto revenge for me. You now have the minimum power required for you to be able to go to the Void Sect’s dimension.”
  
 Chu Shen stared at Master Ti Wu.  “Wait, what? What do you mean that I have the minimum power. Plus, how are we going to get to the Void Sect’s dimension? We haven’t been to any of it so far!”
  
 The look of disdain Master Ti Wu sent towards him froze Chu Shen’s blood. “How confused you are. I was worried for your safety previously because of how low your cultivation was. Now I would say you would be able to at least defend yourself if someone tried to rob you.
  
 “In my world, the cultivation levels of everyone are very high. Most commoners are at the Martial Warrior stage, and most outer disciples are at the Martial Emperor stage. As for elders, they are usually at the stage you are in now, the Heavens Stage. So now, you are finally equal to the elders of second-rate sects. Your opponent, however, is a first-rate sect, and you would only be able to match some of their inner disciples.”
  
 Chu Shen’s mouth fell wide open. This, this-! The stage he had reached was already considered miraculous. One must remember that the Heavens Stage was practically considered a myth.
  
 Each of the powerful sects in his world only had one Heavens Stage cultivator, and they were considered the pinnacle. Yet, such peak experts would only be considered disciples!
  
 Chu Shen shook his head to clear his thoughts. “Okay, I understand that. But you still haven’t answered how I will get there.”
  
 Master Ti Wu grinned. “Oh disciple, how dare you doubt your master. I am still an expert, after all! I can change the spatial coordinates on the charm for the Chains of Transportation. Essentially, I can teleport you wherever I need to, using your bracelet as a medium. Getting there isn’t an issue.”
  
 Chu Shen sighed. “Okay. I did promise you, Master, so I will help you get revenge. Just wait a little longer until I am powerful enough to actually achieve your request.”
  
 Master Ti Wu frowned. “Of course I know that! I just wanted you to find out some news about the Five Heavenly Mountains Sect. I want you to learn what kind of power they have at their disposal, and what you are going to be facing in your future.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “I understand. Anyways, I need to talk to everyone else.”
  
 …………………………………
  
 Chu Shen gathered his group together and informed them that he was going back to his own dimension the next day. There were varied reactions to that statement.
  
 Aslo appeared as though he wanted to charge in right now. He had always been hot-headed, and now he knew there was going to be a fight. He was ready to show off his domain to anyone he was fighting.
  
 Chrissa was sad that they were going to have to destroy the Blazing Tiger sect, but she knew this was required for Chu Shen to gain some semblance of solace. She was still a kind-hearted girl, and while she was ready to kill if needed, she wasn’t comfortable with killing quite yet.
  
 Lucas simply nodded grimly. He had experienced the feeling of losing a parent. When his parents were killed, he wanted to blame the world for their deaths, but he was eventually able to come to terms with the fact that no one was to blame. Chu Shen’s dad was murdered, though, and he had a clear target to exact revenge upon.
  
 He wouldn’t stop until Chu Shen’s dad was avenged and the murderer held accountable. That included the Blazing Tiger sect, because they were the ones that sent that murderer after his friend in the first place.
  
 All three of them agreed to follow Chu Shen back to his world the next day. Lucas took the opportunity to prepare his gear for the trip back. Lucas’ body had returned to his normal look of a teenage boy.
  
 It would be unwise to be fooled by his looks, however. Xentus Viri and Lucas had spent the past two months revising different projects, and this had been their top priority. The number one thing they had to keep in mind was to mimic the skills of martial artists.
  
 An interesting fact was that Lucas was not affected by soul attacks. Normally soul energy was used to disrupt the soul strands that control the user’s Qi. Lucas, on the other hand, did not use soul strands. He simply blasted the energy outwards.
  
 This caused him to be less flexible when fighting, but he made up for it with the sheer amount of power that was granted by the antimatter reactor. Because he didn’t use soul strands to control his energy, soul energy had no effect on him.
  
 The next day, the group, including Chu Lai, was all standing together in the dining hall. Xentus Viri stood in front of them. He had hugged Lucas goodbye a few moments before. While he was willing to go to Chu Shen’s dimension, Chu Shen had refused. His reasoning was that Xentus Viri was a scientist. He would be of no help to them when their mission this time was to kill.
  
 Also, he would be sorely missed back in his own dimension. He was a prominent figure on Sparta, and the council was already worried about him. Leaving without an explanation or trace would only hurt his status with them.
  
 Chu Shen turned towards everyone. “Thank you everyone for coming with me. It means a lot that you all would be willing to risk your lives in order to avenge my father. Thank you. Well, I’ll see you all in my dimension.” With that, he disappeared.
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 189 - Captured!</h1>
  
 Chu Shen and his friends appeared where they had first arrived in Chu Shen’s world. They were on a dirt road with a walled city visible in the distance.
  
 “We’re back, mom. Now, it is time to get revenge on the Blazing Tiger Sect.” Chu Shen turned toward his mom to reassure her. Or at least, he tried to. When he turned around, his mom wasn’t there.
  
 Immediately Chu Shen panicked. He knew that his mom had used the Chains of Transportation, so why wasn’t she here! “Guys! My mom isn’t here!”
  
 “What!” Lucas looked around frantically. “She must be here!”
  
 Chu Shen calmed down after a couple seconds. “Let’s not panic, otherwise we won’t get anywhere. I’m sure she’s fine. How about you go back to your dimension, Lucas, to make sure she isn’t there. Master Ti Wu, I’ll have to trouble you to look for her here.”
  
 Master Ti Wu nodded. “Very mature, you brat. I’ll go ahead and scan once you give me some of your Qi.”
  
 Lucas nodded. “Alright Chu Shen, I’ll do it.” He disappeared right afterwards.
  
 Chu Shen stared up into the sky, ”Where could you be, mom?”
  
 ……………………………
  
 Gu Don sighed as sat down in the luxurious chair. For the past four months, he had been staying at a hotel in a nearby town. When he had lost the connection to his wind seeking rune, he had been ordered by the great elder to stay in the this vicinity.
  
 With their help, he set-up a thousand mile transmission formation so that they could join him if the wind-seeking rune appeared again. So far, the wind-seeking rune had remained silent. He sighed again. When was this boring wait going to end?
  
 Suddenly, he stood up. The wind-seeking rune had finally awoken! The wood element girl was now out of the pocket dimension. He could feel that she was only a couple miles away. It would only take him a couple minutes to get where she was, especially with his speed.
  
 He instantly activated the message talisman. He was only to activate it if the wood element girl appeared. The great elder would appear soon through the formation, so he immediately started preparing to great him.
  
 In less than five minutes, the formation had activated. The great elder appeared with four elders flanking him. Including Gu Don, 5 elders and one great elder were now here to bring back the wood element girl. From this alone, one could tell the importance they placed on Chu Lai.
  
 The great elder looked at Gu Don. “Gu Don, the wood element girl has appeared?”
  
 Gu Don bowed. “Yes great elder. She is not far from here, either. I believe it should only take a few minutes to catch up to her.”
  
 The great elder nodded. “Good. Then we should immediately depart. We wouldn’t want her to go back into the pocket dimension now that we have found her.”
  
 They all swiftly left the hotel before flying into the air. The townspeople were all shocked at the flying cultivators. Why would someone so strong visit their town? Rumors appeared and a local legend was born about a treasure that attracted powerful cultivators to their little town.
  
 ………………………………………….
  
 Chu Lai appeared at the foot of a mountain. Looking around she realized that no one was around her. She was confused since Chu Shen had made it sound as though all of them would be together.
  
 She discovered that she was actually at the foot of the mountain leading to the Majestic Sword Academy. She realized what had happened at that moment. The area she created the charm in was right here, to avoid disturbing the spatial barrier around the academy. When she teleported back home, it must have taken her to where she created the charm.
  
 Chu Lai was about to go up to the academy when she realized that she didn’t have an identification token. Without it, she couldn’t enter. Sighing, she instead went to the town nearby. She was just about to enter the gates when she felt something behind her. Turning around, she gasped.
  
 It was Gu Don, the murderer of her husband!
  
 Gu Don grinned. “Why hello, Chu Lai, we meet again.” He looked around. “Where is that arrogant boy of yours. You see, I brought a few more elders from the Blazing Tiger Sect. I imagine they would like to teach him a lesson or two.”
  
 Chu Lai angrily stared at him. “If he appears here, I am afraid that all of you will be dead.”
  
 Gu Don sighed. “How unfortunate. I was hoping he would be here so that we could gain some leverage over you. No matter. I am sure we can find some other means of persuading you to cooperate with us. Wiping out that branch sect your husband came from, perhaps?”
  
 Chu Lai gasped. “You, you wouldn’t! That would start a war between you and the Chu Sect! They would never let you get away with it!”
  
 Gu Don smiled. “Oh my. We wouldn’t want to fight the Chu Sect, after all. However, I did hear that beast tides were quite common in that area. I am sure that no one would blame us if the branch sect was wiped out by some beasts randomly rampaging in the area, hmm?”
  
 Chu Lai was shaking with rage. Suddenly, two hands grabbed her arms from behind. Twisting her head, she saw a man had appeared behind her. An enormous greatsword was strapped to his back. He grinned at her.
  
 “Hello, Chu Lai. Time to come back to the sect with us.” He yanked her into the air by her wrists. Chu Lai struggled and cried out, but the man ignored her. The other elders fell into formation behind her and the great elder flew in front.
  
 The great elder glanced back at Chu Lai, a grin evident on his face. “It looks as though we have finally captured the wood element for ourselves. Soon, the Blazing Tiger Sect will be unstoppable.”
 
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 190 - Discovered</h1>
  
 Master Ti Wu let out a pulse of spiritual energy. Unlike last time, Chu Shen was able to feel Master Ti Wu’s scan. The Void Qi he had given Master Ti Wu had been infused into his spiritual energy, making it even more powerful.
  
 This allowed him to scan distances that would have been considered impossible beforehand. Of course, it was not to the point of omniscience. Master Ti Wu could only scan a thousand mile radius. Considering the fact that his planet had a circumference of almost twenty five thousand miles, it wasn’t a whole lot.
  
 Master Ti Wu floated above the ground in the lotus position before closing his eyes a few minutes later. He smiled at Chu Shen. “Don’t worry, your mother is safe. She’s at the gate of the Majestic Sword Academy.”
  
 Chu Shen let out a sigh of relief. “Whew. She almost gave me a heart attack.”
  
 He frowned. “Why did she appear at the Majestic Sword Acade-” He facepalmed. “I forgot. She created the charm on her Chains of Transportation there. That must be why we were separated.”
  
 Master Ti Wu nodded. “That would explain it. Anyway, you might want to go get Lucas before he tears up the entire base looking for your mom.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “Thanks for reminding me.”
  
 He disappeared as he activated his charm. Lucas was indeed tearing up the entire base looking for her. First he activated the cameras in the base, checking to make sure that she wasn’t in hiding somewhere.
  
 Then he went over the footage of the dining room. She had disappeared along with everyone else and Xentus Viri confirmed it as well. Then they started looking at the scanners records as well.
  
 Chu Shen appeared before they could delve into them too deeply. “Lucas! We found my mom!”
 
  
 Lucas appeared in front of him. “Where was she?”
 
  
 Chu Shen grinned. “Well, I forgot that we made our charms in different locations. She’s in front of my school, no big deal. Come on, we need you to teleport us there.”
  
 Lucas nodded. He turned to wave at Xentus Viri behind him. “Bye dad, I’ll see you soon.”
  
 Xentus Viri waved as well. “Be careful Lucas, don’t get killed. Or if you do get killed, keep your brainbox in a different body, just like we talked about.”
  
 Lucas rolled his eyes. “I know, dad. Bye.” With that, they disappeared.
  
 …………………………………
  
 Scarcely five minutes had gone by back on Chu Shen’s world. Master Ti Wu appeared once again. He was bound to the Voids Hand that was in Chu Shen’s possession. Unless Chu Shen was in the same dimension as him, Master Ti Wu couldn’t appear. Seperating from Chu Shen by a mile or two was doable, but not a whole dimension.
  
 Chu Shen turned to Lucas. “You mind teleporting us to the Majestic Sword Academy? She should be there.”
  
 Lucas nodded. “Give me a second to lock the coordinates in.” He closed his eyes for a few seconds before nodding. “Alright, let's go.” They all disappeared before reappearing at the foot of the mountain.
  
 Chu Shen looked around, but didn’t see his mom.  He turned towards Master Ti Wu “Where’d she go? I thought you said she would be here?”
  
 Master Ti Wu frowned. “I’m not sure. Maybe she decided to go into the school?” He suddenly smiled. “How about you go ahead and look for her yourself? This should be a good training exercise.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “Alright, what should I do?”
  
 Master Ti Wu sighed. “Just use your soul sense. It should have a much greater range than before.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded before closing his eyes. A burst of invisible soul energy lanced out of him before spreading throughout the entire area. Every blade of grass, every bird in the sky, everything within two miles was encompassed by his soul sense.
  
 Chu Shen searched for his mom. A mile and a half away, his mom had just been grabbed by the elder of the Blazing Tiger Sect. Chu Shen’s eyes snapped open. There was a sonic boom as he stomped on the ground, accelerating towards where his mom was being abducted.
  
 As everyone looked around in confusion, Chu Shen’s voice echoed around them. “MY MOM IS BEING KIDNAPPED!”
  
 Immediately, everyone rushed off in the same direction Chu Shen had just left in. A breeze of wind carried Chrissa off as flames emerged from below Lucas and Aslo, propelling them forward like rockets.
  
 Chu Shen rushed forward, the wind slicing at his body. His clothes were being torn to ribbons, yet he ignored it. He was travelling at twice the speed of sound. That meant it would take him 3.5 seconds to get to his mom.
  
 At the speed that cultivators worked at this point, who knew what would happen in that short time. He kept his soul sense on his mom in order to know what exactly was going on.
  
 His mom was grabbed and hauled into the air. Several people surrounded the one that had grabbed his mom. Two of them stiffened as they realized that someone’s soul sense had locked onto them.
  
 Before they could go far, Chu Shen had reached them. He took out his hammer and lashed out at the one at the back.
  
 ………………………….
  
 The Great Elder had realized that someone was following them. Their immense soul energy immediately alerted him that they were a force to be reckoned with. He turned towards the group. “Prepare for attack! Launch your domains, now!”
  
 The elders were all very experienced and trusted the great elder immensely. Without hesitation, they unleashed their domains. Many different elements sprang to life as their domains came into being.
  
 Cu Shen ignored these domains and continued with his strike towards the one at the back that had unleashed a lightning domain. The lightning lashed out at Chu Shen’s skin but only left smudges of black ash where it struck.
  
 The hammer smashed into the elder’s back. The inscription on Chu Shen’s hammer flared and its weight increased by over one thousand times. The elder turned into a mist of blood from the impact and the shockwave from the blow actually destroyed many of the domains launched by the other elders.
  
 Chu Shen turned to face the great elder. He pointed his hammer at him. “PUT MY MOM DOWN!”
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 191 - Taken</h1>
  
 The great elder frowned. “You are Chu Shen, I take it?” Chu Shen simply stared at him. The great elder nodded. “I will presume your silence is confirmation. This is actually quite an opportunity. You see, we were planning on capturing you. Surrender, boy.”
 
  
 Chu Shen simply stared at him. “I just killed one of your people, yet you think you can take me on?”
  
 The great elder looked confused. “Why would I not be able to take you on? Is it because of the expert you brought along? He must be at the Celestial stage for him to have such a strong soul energy. Don’t think you can take us on with just that.”
  
 Chu Shen was stunned before he suddenly grinned. This guy didn’t realize how strong he was. Maybe with that, he would be able to kill them and rescue his mom. To be honest, the guy did have a right to be arrogant if he hadn’t reached the Universe stage.
  
 If he was still at the World stage and was facing someone that was at the Heaven or Universe stage, he would be completely useless. Based simply on common sense, Chu Shen had only been at the world stage 3 months ago. It was impossible that he had advanced very far, if at all.
  
 “Don’t worry mom, I’ll rescue you in a second.”
  
 The great elder frowned. “Planning on resisting?” He waved his hand at the other elders. “Back off, you’re not match for him. Only soul energy would be useful against him.” The elders bowed before retreating. The one with the greatsword holding his mom also nodded.
  
 A universe descended upon Chu Shen. A total of twenty galaxies with a million stars in each one appeared above him. The great elder smiled as he saw this. With his universe suppressing Chu Shen, it would be a piece of cake to capture him.
  
 What happened next scared the great elder. A universe containing fifty million galaxies with 1 trillion stars in each galaxy appeared around Chu Shen. The sheer amount of stars made the elder want to turn around and flee.
  
 Chu Shen grinned. “How do you like my soul domain?” As he spoke, the domain flew outwards. The domain that the great elder had summoned disappeared as its soul energy was drained into Chu Shen’s universe.
  
 The great elder paled as his soul energy disappeared. He became mentally fatigued as a headache immediately enveloped him. The great elder suddenly turned towards the other elders behind him. “Run! Get the wood element girl to the sect! Tell the sect leader to close the sect and launch the Blazing Tiger Flaming Mirror formation! Do it now, while I stall him!”
  
 Lightning wrapped around the man that was holding Chu Shen’s mother. He turned into a streak of light as he shot into the distance. The sheer speed he was using was more than twice the speed that Gu Don had previously used to escape Chu Shen.
  
 Chu Shen panicked. “NO! MOTHER!” He tried to rush forward, but multiple blades of ice shot at him. “OUT OF THE WAY!”
  
 Chu Shen didn’t dodge the ice blades but simply let them strike his body. There was no way such weak strikes could hurt him. That was a mistake. The ice blades struck his body and the spread. They started coating him in ice. The ice quickly engulfed his body, causing him to freeze in midair.
  
 A chain composed if ice lead back to one of the other elders. He swung his hand, causing the cocoon of ice containing Chu Shen to swing into the ground with a boom. The great elder flew down and placed his hands on the earth surrounding the crater Chu Shen had formed.
  
 Black armor appeared around Chu Sen as he activated the (Cancellation Armor: Reality). The ice that trapped him dissolved instantly as his armor absorbed it. Chu Shen furiously looked up right as the earth suddenly closed in around him.
  
 The great elder had the element of earth! The earth enclosed Chu Shen entirely, before forcing him down deeper underground. When that happened, the great elder relaxed slightly. He had planned it all out with the other elder, using his Qi to communicate unnoticed. That was what had allowed them to ambush Chu Shen.
  
 He turned towards the elders, diverting his focus from the earth that trapped Chu Shen. “I won’t be able to trap him for long. Leave, use the transmission array to get away!”
  
 The elders didn’t hesitate. When Chu Shen destroyed the great elder’s soul domain, Gu Don had immediately fled. The other elders had hoped they could be of some help, but even the most powerful of them had fled with Chu Shen’s mother. What was the point of them sticking around then?
  
 Chu Shen was trapped by the enormous weight of the earth. It squeezed down on his body. Because it was physical rock and not Qi, Chu Shen couldn’t absorb it with his Void Qi. Or he could, but it would take too long. Chu Shen channeled his Qi into the palm of his hand. Then he released the burst energy.
  
 The Qi punched a hole through the ground beside him, but not completely through. He now had enough room to swing his arm. He let out a tremendous punch at the earth around him, causing it to shatter. The shockwave from his punch freed his body from the earthen prison. A hammer appeared in his hand as he swung it upwards at the ceiling.
  
 Above him, the great elder realized that Chu Shen was breaking free. Gritting his teeth, he prepared to channel his Qi into the ground. Before he could do so, there was a loud explosion as the ground ripped apart and exploded below his feet.
  
 Dirt and sand flew upwards into the Qi protecting the great elder. The force of Chu Shen’s blow had pulverized the rock, turning it into sand. Chu Shen jumped out of the hole in the ground as the great elder stumbled backwards.
  
 Upon exiting the hole, Chu Shen didn’t even look at the great elder, but immediately took off. He didn’t have the time to waste killing the elder, not when he still had to rescue his mom.
  
 He sent out his spiritual sense as he flew in the direction the man that had been holding his mom had fled in before. His spiritual sense locked onto the man. The man had changed direction and was flying extremely fast. Chu Shen grit his teeth and raised his speed to the max. At this time, his friends had caught up with him and were actually already in pursuit of some elders.
  
 Chu Shen blasted by the elders and his friends who were fighting. He was only concerned with his mom. The gap between them was slowly closing. The distance closed from 20 miles. To ten, then five. By the time the distance was down to two miles, the elder had appeared next to a transmission array.
  
 During the elder’s flight, he had knocked out Chu Lai to prevent her from struggling. He activated the formation as Chu Shen looked on from two miles away. The elder activated a secondary formation before stepping into the gate that the transmission array had activated. His mom, and the elder, had disappeared.
 
 Chu Shen didn’t give up. Maybe he could still activate the formation and rescue his mom. Then the secondary formation activated right as Chu Shen landed. The array exploded as the self-destruction formation that the transmission array had been built upon activated.
  
 Chu Shen blinked as the explosion occurred. He ignored the flames as they engulfed his body for a couple seconds. The searing heat awakened Chu Shen. “NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!” he yelled out in pain.
  
 He had lost his dad and now his mother, all in a couple months. He gritted his teeth. “Blazing...Tiger...Sect!” he forced out from his clenched teeth. Killing intent filled his soul. An elder that he had passed before suddenly appeared at the array. The elder was stunned to see Chu Shen and immediately tried to flee.
  
 Chu Shen saw him and appeared beside the elder, his hammer already in motion. The elder dissolved into blood as the hammer made contact. Chu Shen let out a harsh wail before charging forward. The only way he could feel better was if he killed! Killed! KILLED!
 
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 192 - Friends</h1>
  
 Chrissa flew forward at her fastest speed. When Chu Shen had yelled that his mom was being kidnapped, her heart sank. She had seen how badly it had hurt Chu Shen when he lost his father. She didn’t want any of her friends to experience such a loss, especially not Chu Shen, when he still hadn’t recovered from the last time.
  
 The wind surrounded Chrissa, pushing her forward at startling speeds, allowing her to outpace Lucas and Aslo. She saw three people starting to flee, though she couldn’t see Chu Shen anywhere. Chrissa immediately assumed that the people trying to flee were the ones that had kidnapped Chu Shen’s mom.
  
 She took off in pursuit. Thanks to her wind element, she quickly caught up with a few of them. She then yelled at them. “STOP! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?” Chrissa wanted to make sure that they were the people she was looking for. She’d feel awful if she accidentally hurt some innocent people.
  
 One of the men turned towards her. “You should mind your own business! We are from the Blazing Tiger Sect! Go away if you know what’s good for you!”
  
 Chrissa’s eyes turned red with fury. Indeed these were the men she was looking for. “You’re from the Blazing Tiger Sect? Good!” A blade of wind shot forward from above her, soaring straight at the man that had spoken.
  
 Stunned at the violent reaction, the man didn’t react in time and the blade struck him in the back. He wasn’t killed, his Qi protecting him from the slicing power of the wind scythe. The impact still threw him to the ground however, making a decent-sized crater.
  
 The other two elders were stunned, but didn’t stop. They didn’t have the time. Chu Shen would soon be free, and they would be lucky if they didn’t die here. The elders simply tried to fly faster.
  
 Chrissa created a vortex of wind that sucked one of the other elders back towards her. The last elder was about to be sucked backwards as well, but a large sword appeared in his hand. The elder stood on top of the sword as though it was a skateboard.
  
 The sword lit up blue before shooting off, escaping Chrissa’s range. It was a flying sword! Chrissa realized she couldn’t keep up and decided to detain the two she had already captured.
  
 The elder that had been slammed into the ground was furious. How could he have been ambushed? By a girl, no less! Snowflakes started to appear around him as frost spread on the ground. His ice domain had activated.
  
 “Little girl! You shouldn’t have done that! Now you’re going to pay!” As the elder spoke, swords of ice appeared around him and then shot towards Chrissa.
  
 Chrissa waved her hand, causing a gust of wind to surge forth. The swords hit the wind and slowed dramatically. Small flakes of ice flew off the swords, causing a powdery snow to trail behind it. The swords still pressed onwards, even as they became smaller and smaller.
  
 The air around the elder that had been trapped in the tornado started to shimmer as he released a domain of pure heat. The air around him distorted as it heated up, causing the hurricane to dissipate.
  
 Upon escaping the whirlwind, he immediately resumed fleeing. The elder that was fighting with Chrissa was stunned at this. “Fu Shen!” The elder bellowed. “Come back here! You can’t escape unless she is dead! Fu Shen!”
  
 The elder called Fu Shen didn’t hesitate or turn back. He simply kept fleeing. Suddenly, a beam of bright red light struck his back. The beam hesitated for a second before piercing through the elder’s shoulder. “ARGH!” Fu Shen screamed as his flesh burned.
  
 Chrissa turned around and saw Aslo and Lucas coming up behind her. The red beam was a laser that Lucas had shot from his palm. Lucas flew up beside her.
 “Sorry for being late, Chrissa. You’re pretty fast now.”
  
 Chrissa smiled softly. “I used my soul energy to increase the power of my flight spell. That’s why you couldn’t keep up with me.”
  
 The two elders were now worried. Even when they outnumbered the girl before, they had been at a disadvantage. Now they were the ones outnumbered. Fu Shen, in particular, was extremely scared. He had no idea what that red light was, but he knew that he would have died if it had been aimed at his head instead.
  
 The elder with the frost domain suddenly raised his hands. His domain of frost suddenly exploded in range. It covered Lucas, Aslo, and Chrissa in one fell sweep. Frost crept over their skin and layers of ice appeared over their bodies. In a matter of seconds, all of them had been turned into ice statues.
  
 The elder knew he was only buying some time. He and Fu Shen both started to flee. Before they could get travel farther than a quarter mile, a surge of heat behind them let them know that the frost domain had been dispelled.
  
 Chrissa, Aslo, and Lucas were all in pursuit and were catching up fast. When they caught up, Aslo caused his domain to expand, covering everyone in a domain of fire. The elder with the frost domain was sweating, as this domain was far more powerful than his, and directly countered his own element. All of them suddenly heard a sonic boom. A blur of color passed by them as though they were standing still.
  
 Lucas’ cybernetic eyes swiftly took in the sight of the blur. It was Chu Shen. A desperate look was on his face as he swiftly shot past them. Lucas frowned. They hadn’t seen his mother yet. Apparently, she wasn’t out of danger.
  
 Lucas turned back to the elders. “Don’t you know who we are!? We belong to the Blazing Tiger Sect!” Fu Shen desperately shouted out.
  
 Aslo decided to speak up. “Oh, we know exactly who you are.”
  
 Fu Shen seemed shocked. “Then why attack us? Aren’t you scared of the sect retaliating? The Blazing Tiger Sect is one of the top 3 sects in the entire empire. Even those at the Universe realm would be hard-pressed to survive the sect’s wrath, much less you World-Stage cultivators!”
  
 Aslo grinned. “Well you see, we have a friend of ours called Chu Shen. It just so happens that you all killed his dad and kidnapped his mom. So unfortunately, we don’t have a choice. Sorry, but it’s time for you to die.”
  
 With that, Aslo leapt forward. A sword appeared in his hand as he charged at the elder with the frost domain. Chrissa made her wind blades shoot at the elder with the fire domain. The elder with the fire domain forced his to come to life.
  
 The wind blades caused his domain to flare up with power. Chrissa frowned. Lucas stepped forward. “Chrissa, do you want me to take him on?”
  
 Chrissa shook her head. “I need experience fighting those whose elements counter mine. Let me take this person on.”
  
 Lucas nodded. “Alright then.”
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 193 - Kill</h1>
  
 Aslo decided to clash head-on with the elder that had the frost domain. A sword was held in the elder’s hand, opposing the sword in Aslo’s hand. Sparks flew as their swords met, clashing fiercely in midair. They locked their swords together for a brief second, before flying apart.
  
 Aslo dashed right back at the elder, his sword held off to the side. As he got close, he swung his sword in a horizontal slash, which the elder dodged. He returned the blow with a thrust at Aslo’s chest, but his sword was batted aside by the flat of Aslo’s blade.
  
 The elder spun in a circle backwards, using the force to escape from Aslo’s range. He stood in midair, panting. Both him and Aslo were aware that Aslo was simply toying with him. Anytime he tried to use ice with his attacks, it was evaporated by the heat of Aslo’s domain.
  
 If Aslo really wanted to end this fight, all he had to do was simply activate his domain, and turn the elder  into ashes. The elder realized that this was an opportunity.
  
 ‘A brat who just advanced. His arrogance will let me get the opportunity to kill him. No, don’t kill him. Only wound. That way while Fu Shen is distracting one, the other will be taking care of this arrogant brat. Then I can escape to the teleportation portal.’ The elder recognized that Aslo was indeed skilled with the sword. Compared to him though, Aslo still seemed wet behind the ears.
  
 Aslo stared at the elder, a maniacal grin on his face. The only reason Aslo hadn’t used his domain to kill the elder was to enjoy a nice fight. He loved fighting, and being able to finally let loose was far different than the torture Chu Shen had called sparring.
  
 Now he wasn’t cooped up inside a building cultivating and his brain didn’t feel like it was exploding from having to meditate all day long. He was finally able to express himself completely with the sword in his hand. Flame exploded beneath Aslo’s feet, causing him to surge forward with frightening speed, once again engaging the elder.
  
 Chrissa, on the other hand, wasn’t as happy for a fight. She approached the fight methodically, exploring one way to fight before moving onto another. Chrissa infused a large of amount of Qi into her wind blade before shooting it out.
  
 This simply caused the man’s flames to flare even higher. She then tried forming a hurricane, but the wind simply increased the man’s power. Seeing Chrissa struggling, Aslo decided to help out. “Chrissa, try sucking the air away from the fire. Fire uses air to burn, so by taking it away, the fire should go out.”
  
 Chrissa nodded before creating another vortex of wind. Unlike the hurricane before, she did not try to use the strong wind to destroy Fu Shen’s domain, instead using the wind to suck the air away from the domain. The fire spluttered before suddenly going out, as though an invisible giant had gone over and blown it out.
  
 Chrissa nodded. Now she knew how to face fire domains. Fu Shen paled. “What witchcraft is this! Everyone knows that wind strengthens fire, it could never put it out!”
 (Ed. Note: She just took away all the air, how is he talking and not suffocating? He should be choking to death in the vortex. And how is she hearing him over the howl of the vortex?)
  
 Lucas laughed. “Everyone knows? How silly. You simply don’t understand what fire truly is. By understanding the laws of nature, you would have known why your fire was put out. Since you don’t, you are now helpless.”
  
 Chrissa frowned. “Don’t talk so much, Lucas.”
  
 Lucas sulked. “Can’t I look smart in front of the villains?” he mumbled to himself.
  
 “I don’t believe, I don’t believe, I DON’T BELIEVE IT!” Fu Shen roared as he sent an enormous fireball at Chrissa.
  
 A wind blade formed in front of her, slicing through the fireball that was soaring towards her. The fireball wasn’t as strong as Fu Shen’s domain, allowing Chrissa’s wind blade to blow the fireball out.
  
 Fu Shen created more fireballs, launching them continuously at Chrissa. Just as he launched his twentieth fireball, a sonic boom rang out from behind him. Fu Shen turned around to see what had made the noise before a hammer smashed into his face.
  
 His entire body vibrated from an impact that was the equivalent of a nuclear bomb. With a loud BOOM, his body turned into a mist of blood. Chu Shen stood where the elder had previously been. His face was twisted into an angry mask. A dense killing intent emanated from his body.
  
 Chu Shen glanced up and saw the elder that was fighting with Aslo. He disappeared before re-appearing before the elder. His hammer was already smashing into the elders back, once again causing a mist of blood to rain down.
  
 Aslo opened his mouth to complain about Chu Shen interrupting his fight. However, once he noticed Chu Shen’s expression, he shut up. While he was brash and arrogant, Aslo wasn’t stupid.
  
 Chu Shen merely floated in midair, silent without saying a word. Lucas came over. “Chu Shen,” he asked quietly, “Did you rescue your mom?”
  
 Chu Shen didn’t say anything for a long time, but his friends didn’t rush him. Finally, Chu Shen said something. “No.” His voice was filled with rage and self-loathing. “I-I couldn't save her.” He looked down at his hands before clenching them together. “All my power, and I couldn’t save her. Because of one mistake.”
  
 Lucas and Chrissa glanced at each other, recognizing the fact that Chu Shen was in a delicate state at the moment. “Chu Shen, is she dead?”
 
 Chu Shen froze before violently shaking his head. “No, no, no… She, she isn’t dead. Simply captured.”
  
 Aslo let out a sigh. “Good, that just means we have to rescue her. No big deal. Let’s find out where the Blazing Tiger Sect is and get your mom from there before killing them all. Simple.”
  
 Lucas and Chrissa both stared daggers at Aslo. Aslo froze. What did he do wrong this time? He thought it was a good solution.
  
 Chu Shen nodded slowly after hearing Aslo’s proposal. “It is possible. Master Ti Wu?”
  
 Master Ti Wu’s figure appeared before Chu Shen. “What, disciple?” Even Master Ti Wu recognized what a delicate state Chu Shen was in right now. He didn’t speak in his normal abrasive tone, rather like one would to a brother.
  
 Chu Shen didn’t talk respectful at all. “You said that you knew where the Blazing Tiger Sect is. Guide us.”
  
 Master Ti Wu didn’t say anything. He simply nodded. He closed his eyes as a pulse of invisible soul energy lanced outwards. A few minutes later he opened his eyes. “Your mom is being held behind a barrier, it’s not too strong. Teleporting directly there is impossible though. However, we can arrive on the outskirts of the sect. It’s two hundred miles from here, to the east."
  
 Chu Shen turned towards Lucas. “Can you teleport us there?”
  
 Lucas nodded. “Anything for you, Chu Shen.” He closed his eyes as he connected to the satellite he had launched into space. A few seconds later he opened his eyes. “Coordinates locked. Teleporting, now.”
 
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 194 - Blazing Tiger Sect</h1>
  
 Chu Shen and his friends reappeared in the middle of a stone road. The road lead towards a valley between two large mountains. In that valley lay the Blazing Tiger Sect. A large wall made of jade surrounded magnificent pagodas. A large sign with the words “Blazing Tiger Sect” stood outside the gates made of solid gold.
  
 A red semi-transparent barrier covered the entire Blazing Tiger Sect. A terrifying amount of energy seemed to be emanating from the barrier. Chu Shen realized this must have been the barrier that Master Ti Wu had been talking about. A determined look came over his face. All he needed to do was smash through the barrier, and then he could rescue his mom.
  
 ………………………………………………………………………………………...
  
 Inside the Blazing Tiger Sect, the sect master was facing the elder with the greatsword. The elder had appeared outside the sect due to the spatial restrictions imposed by the barrier.
  
 Upon entering, he first sent Chu Lai to the prison cells, and then he went straight to the sect master. The sect master frowned as he listened to the tale of the man with the greatsword. “Are you sure he said to activate the Blazing Tiger Flaming Mirror formation? Not just the Flaming Mirror formation?”
  
 The elder nodded. “Yes. He also said for you to close the sect down.”
  
 The sect master sighed. “Unless you can give me a reason, then I can’t activate the formation the Great elder requested.” It wasn’t that the sect master didn’t trust the great elder, he simply couldn’t activate such a precious formation based on word alone.
  
 One must understand, the Blazing Tiger Flaming Mirror formation was a legend of the sect. It was a treasure that had taken fifteen years  for multiple five star array masters to make.
  
 It had taken over 90% of the sect’s resources to hire the array masters and buy the materials needed, before it was completed five hundred years ago. The end result was the trump card of the Blazing Tiger Sect.
  
 The formation was mostly meant for defense. It used soul energy, allowing it to withstand Universe Realm cultivators, though if more then two attacked it would be destroyed.
  
 Upon activating the formation, over a thousand Rank 7 Beast Cores would be consumed every month just keeping it active. The cost of activating it was something the Blazing Tiger Sect could afford, but not for long.
  
 At most they could withstand the cost for three years. After that, they would run out of resources. The fact that they could keep it activated for three years was proof of how powerful the Blazing Tiger Sect truly was.
  
 Of course, this cost was only for keeping it activated. If the formation was under attack, the consumption rate would increase exponentially. How long it could truly keep up was something that no one had looked into.
  
 The elder nodded. “I understand, sect master. Please be prepared, though. I believe that the great elder wouldn’t have requested such a thing without due reason.”
  
 The sect master sighed. “I know. I have faith in the great elder. No need to wor-.” He suddenly frowned. “Someone just teleported in.”
  
 The sect master flew out of the hall and towards the gate where he had sensed the teleportation. Before he had reached there, he heard a tremendous BOOM and the entire barrier surrounding the sect shuddered. A man with a hammer had appeared before the barrier.
  
 The hammer was embedded into the barrier and cracks spread throughout the entire barrier. The barrier was still standing, however. The sheer destructive force caused the sect master to pale. Even he would have to go all out in order to cause such damage to the barrier. To think that a casual blow with a hammer could cause such destruction….
  
 The elder beside the sect master pointed at the man. “That is Chu Shen, the one the great elder was warning you about.”
  
 The sect master master nodded gravely. “I understand now.” A jade token appeared in his hand and was crushed. A signal was sent throughout the sect.
  
 Surrounding the sect was a jade wall. This jade wall was actually the foundation for the different formations that protected the sect and was hollow on the inside. Many of the elders stayed here cultivating, ready to activate any formation required and provide their energy to the formations.
  
 The elder in charge for this month was in a state of panic as the barrier was under attack. Over 60% of the energy had been consumed in less than a second. He had no idea what to do, and had called the other elders already.
  
 Suddenly, a loud gong sounded. The elder calmed down. He sat down on the ground in the lotus position. More elders ran into the room before sitting down. A total of thirteen elders appeared in the room. Twelve elders sat in a circle around the great elder, who controlled the formation.
  
 Qi flowed from the elders into black lines inscribed into the floor. The Qi activated bundles of Rank 7 fire element beast cores that were in the walls. A total of one thousand beast cores distributed evenly across the jade wall were activated. More and more Qi gathered until it suddenly shot upwards, enclosing the entire Blazing Tiger Sect in a dense red shield of light.
  
 The Blazing Tiger Flaming Mirror formation was activated!
  
 …………………………………………………………………….
  
 Chu Shen saw the barrier surrounding the Blazing Tiger Sect. Dense killing intent came from his body. Without a second though, he charged at the school. Flying into the air, he withdrew his hammer.
  
 With a mighty blow, he smashed into the barrier. A loud BOOM rang out as the barrier shuddered. Cracks spread as the impact started to destroy the barrier. Chu Shen stood in midair and hauled his hammer over his head.
  
 A second blow rained down on the barrier. Even more cracks spread. Then a third blow came. Then a fourth. After the barrier was hit a fifth time, it finally collapsed into shards of translucent red energy.
  
 Chu Shen stared at it for a second, almost disbelieving that the barrier was so weak. Chu Shen then started to go forward, but a new, huge red barrier suddenly shot out of the wall below. It stopped Chu Shen from entering the Blazing Tiger Sect.
  
 A person appeared on the other side of the barrier. Chu Shen had no idea who it was.
  
 The man opened his mouth. “I am the Sect Master. Who are you to be attacking the Blazing Tiger Sect?”
  
 “My name is Chu Shen.”
  
 The Sect Master sighed. “I see. So there is no chance of talking you down. I guess the Blazing Tiger Flaming Mirror formation will have to be activated completely then, in order to kill you.”
  
 A white jade token appeared in his hand before being crushed. “For someone so talented, it is a shame that you will have to die from this fiery inferno.”
  
 The red barrier started to glow ominously. Chu Shen gripped his hammer tightly, his knuckles turning white. His head went backwards as he roared out fiercely. “GO AHEAD! I’LL SMASH WHATEVER I NEED TO UNTIL I RESCUE MY MOM!”
  

 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 195 - Elders</h1>
  
 The Sect Master frowned as Chu Shen’s roar echoed out across the Blazing Tiger Sect. “Nice spirit. But this barrier is over a thousand times stronger than the one you smashed before. Not only that, but it has offensive capabilities! It will take more than spirit to survive.”
  
 After he spoke, a red beam of light shot outwards from the formation. Chu Shen activated his armor in expectation of the blow, but none came. The red beam split apart. Multiple red tinted mirrors surrounded Chu Shen, creating a sphere around him.
  
 Chu Shen felt a suppressive force pushing down on him. Deep down inside, he marveled at the power of the artificers that had created this formation. This formation actually simulated the power of a domain!
  
 It was not just an elemental domain, Chu Shen could feel soul energy was also a part of the formation. Such prowess in formations! Clearly, whoever
 had made the formation was also in the Universe Realm. They must have been, in order to understand and assimilate soul energy into the formation.
 
  
 The sect master grinned. “Now there is no chance of escape. This is the Blazing Mirror domain. It uses fire Qi and soul energy to suppress whatever is caught inside. It also has the ability to reflect force back at whatever attacks it. Surrender, and we will only trap you. Resist and die!”
  
 Chu Shen had an ominous look on his face. “You think you’re so smart. You think that you have me trapped? Look again! Let me prove to you that nothing you try will keep me from my mom!”
  
 The heat from the domain had previously caused the air to shimmer. Now the air was filled with a black mist. Void Qi billowed out from Chu Shen, dissolving the Blazing Mirror domain. Everywhere the darkness touched, the red light was snuffed out.
  
 The sect master looked on, stunned. ‘H-how is this possible! Is it the darkness element? No, it can’t be! This is too strong an effect for it to be the darkness element alone! Maybe a mutation?!’
  
 The blackness suddenly imploded as Chu Shen absorbed the Void Qi back into his body, forming a black armor. The brilliant red mirrors were gone without a trace. Upon seeing Chu Shen again, the sect master recovered his composure.
  
 “Congratulations, it looks like you do have some power, after all! Unfortunately for you, you still can’t get to us! The Blazing Tiger Flaming Mirror formation only has a minimum amount of offensive capabilities. There is no way that you could possibly break the defenses of the formation!”
  
 The sect master sighed. It looked as though they wouldn’t be able to capture Chu Shen after all. Oh, well. They could keep the formation activated for three years, but he doubted that Chu Shen would wait outside the sect for that long. Their allies and the imperial majesty would hear about their situation. With the imperial forces, Chu Shen wouldn’t stand a chance.
  
 Chu Shen raised his hand. Black Qi billowed out of his palms as his Void Domain came into being. Chu Shen took a few steps forward. When he did, his Void Domain followed and overlapped with the barrier.
  
 There wasn’t any flashy clash. Instead, the red barrier dissolved like snow. Energy inside the barrier surged forth, attempting to fix the hole in the barrier. Chu Shen was constantly absorbing the energy, but he soon realized that there was actually too much energy for him to absorb.
  
 He had never faced this problem. Yet, Chu Shen instantly realized what he needed to do. Multiple large black shields appeared around him. They didn’t serve a purpose except to waste Qi. If he didn’t, than it was possible that his meridians would burst from the excess energy.
  
 Chu Shen dashed forward, passing through the hole he had created. His hammer was fiercely swung at the sect master. The sect master was stunned at this new development, but the intense feeling of danger he felt allowed him to recover.
  
 A shield of water appeared in front of him. Chu Shen’s hammer smashed into it. The liquid wrapped around his hammer, slowing it down. Surprisingly, that fierce hammer was actually stopped by the thin shield of water.
  
 Chu Shen frowned. His domain flared to life, causing the water shield to disappear. The sect master pedaled backwards. He crushed a jade token in his hands, ordering the other elders to come to his aid.
  
 Lucas, Aslo, and Chrissa were all observing from where they had first arrived. This was a private matter of Chu Shen, and all of them knew instinctively to not interfere.
  
 The elders that were previously in charge of controlling the barrier had realized someone managed to break through. They were continuing to keep the barrier up since they didn’t know how many people were out there besides the one they could detect. Than the order came from the sect master.
  
 The elders all hastened over, and were stunned upon leaving the wall. The sect master was currently fleeing from a young man surrounded by black mist. It was almost comical until they noticed that the shockwave from a single blow of the man’s hammer destroyed a building below them.
  
 Different domains came into being as they rushed at the hammer-wielding man. As they flew into the black mist, their domains dissolved like snow before a fire.
  
 Chu Shen turned his attention towards them. He appeared beside one of the elders, his hammer already in motion. With a BOOM, the elder disappeared. Chu Shen appeared again and again in front of the various elders. Each time marked the death of an elder.
  
 The only reason Chu Shen hadn’t been able to kill the sect master thus far was because of his soul energy. By infusing it into his Qi, the sect master was fast enough to escape from Chu Shen.
  
 By the time Chu Shen had killed ten of the elders, the last two were finally reacting. It didn’t help them, however. One of them slashed at Chu Shen with his sword, but his hammer destroyed the sword and its wielder together with one blow.
  
 Chu Shen thrust his hammer backwards behind him. His hammer was vibrating and the wind caused by his hammer was also vibrating. This was the Song of the Universe! The vibrating air struck the last elder.
  
 The force of the vibrations traveled into his body and dissolved his internal organs. The elder coughed up blood as his eyes turned lifeless. His corpse slowly fell from the air.
  
 Chu Shen turned towards the sect master. “Your elders are gone. Your barrier is useless. Even you are of no use against me. Just what are you going to do now, to keep my mother from me?”
  
 The sect master opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He didn’t have a response. He just didn’t know what to say.
  
 Than a loud booming voice sounded. “Junior, I do not know what my descendants have done, but don’t you think it’s dishonorable to bully weaklings like them?
  
 
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 196 - Safe</h1>
  
 The sect master heaved a sigh of relief. When he had crushed the token to summon the elders, it had also sent a signal to the ancestor. He hadn’t been sure if the ancestor was in the middle of cultivating.
  
 If the ancestor was busy, then he wouldn’t have been able to summon him no matter how hard he tried. Luckily, the ancestor wasn’t busy. Maybe he would survive long enough for the distress signal to reach the imperial forces.
  
 Chu Shen could sense the enormous amount of soul energy flowing from behind the sect master. In that direction was a man standing in midair. A platform of earth was floating beneath him.
  
 “They kidnapped my mom. I don’t care if it is honorable or not, I’m killing them.” Chu Shen answered the man, his voice cold.
  
 The ancestor turned towards the sect master. “Is this true?” His voice showed his anger.
  
 The sect master bowed. “I’m sorry, sir. I myself wouldn’t fall to such despicable acts, but there were circumstances. His mom has the wood element. There is no way we could possibly miss this opportunity.”
  
 The ancestor frowned. “If she has the wood element, then why didn’t you convince her to come? Use our resources and wealth to tempt her, not kidnap her.”
  
 The sect master shook his head. “Her name is Chu Lai and she belongs to the Chu Sect.”
  
 The ancestor sighed. “I see. Then you really did have no choice.” He turned towards Chu Shen. “I’m sorry, young man, but I can’t release your mom. I can promise you that she will not be mistreated though, and she will receive the best care possible.”
  
 Chu Shen didn’t say anything for a while. “You know, I don’t hate you as much. I think I’ll spare you if you move now. However, everyone that kidnapped my mom MUST DIE!”
  
 Chu Shen dashed forward towards the sect master,  his hammer raised. “IMPUDENT!” The thunderous voice rang out as a universe appeared in front of Chu Shen. The soul energy from the universe pressed down on his body and soul, or at least, it tried.
  
 Chu Shen’s domain exploded outwards, absorbing the soul energy of the ancestor. His hammer was unleashed on the sect master. Streams of water shot at Chu Shen from the sect master and multiple shields of water appeared in front of him.
  
 Chu Shen’s hammer started vibrating. The water streams and shields of water started to dissolve from the void Qi. The water shields were stacked upon one another, allowing two of the twelve to survive long enough to impact the hammer.
  
 The hammer smashed through the shields but it slowed down noticeably. Using that, the sect master lunged forward, a rapier appearing in his hand. Black armor appeared around Chu Shen and started vibrating.
  
 The rapier stabbed Chu Shen’s armor. The sect master grinned fiercely, but then he paled. A vibrational force traveled from the rapier into his body, destroying his internal organs. Just like the elder from before, he coughed up blood before dying, his corpse falling to the ground.
  
 Chu Shen turned towards the ancestor. His universe appeared around the ancestor, causing him to fall to his knees. Chu Shen dashed up beside him, his hammer falling down.
  
 The ancestor took a deep breath before a gravity field manifested around him. Chu Shen dipped downwards, his hammer missing the ancestor. Adjusting to the gravity, Chu Shen took off the ancestor again. Suddenly, the gravity disappeared, causing Chu Shen to completely miss the ancestor and fly up into the air uncontrollably.
  
 Gravity fluctuated rapidly, sometimes light, sometimes heavy. Chu Shen tried to adjust, but he simply couldn’t do it. His domain had been activated, but there appeared to nothing to absorb.
  
 Frustrated, Chu Shen managed to face the ancestor who was still kneeling from the pressure of Chu Shen’s soul domain. He unleashed a blast of pure Qi, not forgetting to cause the Qi to vibrate as he did so.
  
 The ancestor paled. He tried to form a shield of earth, but the pressure from the soul domain interrupted him. The ancestor tried to use soul energy, but it was absorbed by the universe surrounding him. There was no way for him to survive this.
  
 Just like the past three victims of Chu Shen, the ancestor’s internal organs were turned to liquid. His body fell as blood streamed from his mouth. Chu Shen stared at the body as it fell.
  
 Below him, many students of the Blazing Tiger Sect stared upwards. Horrified expressions were on their faces. A couple of them were desperately trying to flee, but most of them understood that they couldn’t possibly escape if Chu Shen didn’t want them to.
  
 The Blazing Tiger Flaming Mirror formation had been taken down when the elders left the wall. Chrissa, Lucas, and Aslo all appeared beside Chu Shen. Lucas looked down at the people below them. “What will you do Chu Shen?”
  
 Chu Shen sighed. “I can’t kill the innocent. The elders, the sect master, and everyone else that knew about the plot to kidnap my mom are dead. Now I just need to rescue her. Besides, the Blazing Tiger Sect doesn’t have any powerhouses now. It is destined to disappear from this world.”
  
 Lucas nodded. “Good. Let us help you get your mom, then. If we don’t kill the guards right away, the might try to threaten your mom. My lasers make it easier for us to kill them instantly without alerting anyone else.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “I’ll leave it to you, Lucas.”
 
  
 The prison had only a few guards, and a series of formations. The security was lax due to the prisoners always being sealed. Also, who would attack the prison?
  
 The guards didn’t even know what had happened when focused beams of red light shot silently into their skulls. Lasers were very inefficient in the atmosphere due to the scattering of photons. However, the one thing Lucas wasn’t lacking in was power, and that made up the difference.
  
 Chu Shen flew into the prison, casually shattering the metal bars that held his mother. Chu Lai had tears streaming down her face as Chu Shen walked into the cell. She hugged him, desperately clinging to him. She knew how tough it must have been to rescue her, yet he didn’t hesitate.
  
 “Don’t worry, mom.” Chu Shen whispered in her ear. “You’re safe now. Dad’s been avenged, and they won’t be hunting you down anymore.”
  
 He pulled away from her embrace. “Come on, mom. Let’s go home.”
  
 
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 197 - Aftermath</h1>
  
 Chu Shen tuned to Lucas. “You mind teleporting us back to the sect? I wanna get my mom home.”
  
 Lucas nodded. “Sure. I have something to take care of on my own though, so I won’t be going back with you.”
  
 Chu Shen was puzzled by this, but nodded. They disappeared as Lucas activated his teleporter. Then Lucas disappeared as well. He reappeared back where he had fought the elders when they had first captured Chu Shen’s mom.
  
 His eyes extended, becoming miniature telescopes, scanning the area around him. Lucas locked onto one area in particular. His arm glowed before a red beam shot outwards.
  
 He shook his head sadly. “Chu Shen, you careless fool. Allow me to do this for you at least.”
  
 Afterwards he disappeared, reappearing where he had teleported Chu Shen. They hadn’t gone far and he rejoined them shortly.
  
 …………………………………………………
  
 The great elder was exhausted. His soul energy was gone, absorbed by that brat. He was incredibly tired, as though he had stayed up for an entire night. The great elder fought through the exhaustion though, continuing to flee.
  
 After Chu Shen escaped from his earth prison, he’d actually ignored him to pursue his mom. He’d passed out afterwards, but woke up when the sect master sent out a distress signal ordering the elders to assemble.
  
 Upon receiving the signal, the great elder started to flee. He had experienced Chu Shen’s power; that shocking soul domain, and the ability to cancel out elemental domains.
  
 That brat was unstoppable. If the sect master was being pressured enough to sound the alarm like that, then no one would be able to stop Chu Shen, not even the ancestor. The Blazing Tiger Sect was finished. Rather than attempt to save a dying sect, it would be better to flee now.
  
 All these thoughts swirled through the great elders head as he flew away. Then, his mind went blank. It was understandable. After all, a laser had just burned away any capability of higher thought as it lanced through his skull, leaving a smoldering hole where a living being used to be.
  
 …………………………………………………………….
  
 Fu Hai was an outer disciple of the Blazing Tiger Sect. He was training at the martial arts field when he heard the explosion. Believing it was just a fight going on behind him, he ignored it.
  
 Multiple explosions went off soon after. Fu Hai became concerned after that. There was no reason for anyone to be using that much force. He started looking around when something fell from the sky. With a THUD, it landed beside him.
  
 Fu Hai was stunned by what he saw. The fifth elder was laying on the ground, his face contorted in pain. His eyes stared lifelessly off into space and blood trickled out of his mouth.
  
 The elder was dead.
  
 Fu Hai freaked out. “AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!”
  
 A booming voice rang out. “IMPUDENT!” The voice, combined with another loud boom, made him come back to reality. Looking up at the sky, he saw the sect master falling as well. An old man he had never seen before exploded into a mist of blood as a hammer smashed into him.
  
 A young man stood in midair. Blood covered his body and in his hand was a silvery-metal hammer. Three more young people flew over. They appeared to talk in mid air before disappearing.
  
 Fu Hai fell onto the ground. He stayed there for the next hour. Finally, he managed to get up. He ran. He ran and ran and ran, until he reached the gate of the sect.
  
 His friend, Kon Ba, saw him running. “Fu Hai! Where are you going?!”
  
 Fu Hai stopped and turned towards his friend. “I’m abandoning the sect.”
  
 Kon Ba was stunned. “Abandoning the sect? Why? Don’t you know you could be taken to the discipline hall for talking like that?”
  
 Fu Hai shook his head. “The fifth elder and sect master are dead. I saw their bodies. The Blazing Tiger sect is finished.”
  
 Kon Ba stared at him. “What are you talking about, Fu Hai? No one could kill the sect master, no one would dare to.”
  
 Fu Hai sighed. “I’m not asking you to believe me now. Just go the training field. The fifth elder’s body is there. Spread the word. Without the sect master or the elders, the Blazing Tiger sect is finished.”
 
  
 Fu Hai continued running. Kon Ba stared after him, feeling a little frightened. He’d known Fu Hai for a while now and he’d always been cool headed. To see him panicking now… was disturbing, to say the least.
  
 Kon Ba still didn’t believe that the sect master was dead. It was unthinkable. Yet, he also believed that Fu Hai wouldn’t say such a thing if it wasn’t true. Caught between believing two unbelievable things, Kon Ba decided to go see if the fifth elder’s body really was at the training field.
  
 Fu Hai ran outside the gates of the sect. His Qi enhanced his body, allowing him to run very fast. Where would he go? He didn’t know yet. All he knew was that whoever had killed the sect master was unbelievably strong. If they had wanted to kill him, it would be no different than crushing an ant.
  
 It was a massive threat to stick around when such a powerful force was attacking. Fu Hai ran into the forest. ‘I hope you can survive, Kon Ba.’
  
 …………………………………..
  
 Kon Ba soon found the dead elder’s body. He spread the word to the rest of the sect. Soon after, many disciples left the sect, desperately fleeing from the powerful force that had killed their elders.
  
 The masters that were still alive in the Blazing Tiger sect were only moderately powerful. Upon hearing the news, they also decided to leave. As a matter of fact, they left even faster than the disciples.
  
 Soon, the entire Blazing Tiger Sect was practically empty except for one or two stubborn disciples. The halls that once contained the martial art scrolls, weapons, and pills were empty, their contents carried away by the fleeing students. Not a single resource was left. The Blazing Tiger Sect had transformed into a ghost sect overnight.
  
 The Blazing Tiger Sect would vanish from existence. Their tragic story would remain a mystery and a hotly debated topic by historians. The unknown cause of this ruin was a young man, named Chu Shen.
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 198 -Travel</h1>

 Chu Shen went into the Majestic Sword Academy with his mother. Master Lang heard, and came out to greet them. “Ah, disciple. You’ve decided to return. So, what have you decided to do about the Blazing Tiger Sect?”
  
 Chu Shen shook his head. “The Blazing Tiger Sect is no more. I killed the sect master and their ancestor. Their elders are gone, too. Quite frankly, I doubt they will survive past a week.”
  
 Master Lang was shocked, and couldn’t think of anything to say. Finally, he rubbed his neck. “I am sorry I couldn’t be there to support you, Chu Shen. It makes me feel as though I didn’t do much as a master.”
  
 Chu Shen shook his head. “No. You helped forge my character, both you and dad. No matter what, I look at you as I would have with him.”
 
 Master Lang nodded sadly. “I miss him, Chu Shen, I really do. He was like a brother to me.”
 
 Chu Shen smiled. “I know.”
  
 For the next week, Chu Shen rested and recovered. He spent time with his mother. It felt great to relax, especially since he didn’t have the threat of his mom being kidnapped dangling over his head.
  
 Cultivating non-stop was too stressful on the mind. Taking a break every now and then wasn’t detrimental to training, it was actually quite beneficial. One must reward hard work properly, and Chu Shen had certainly worked hard.
  
 Eventually, Chu Shen had to return back to his training regime. At the end of the week, he called out Master Ti Wu to ask him about the next phase of training.
  
 “Master Ti Wu, are you there?” Chu Shen whispered into the gauntlet on his arm. His soul form slowly floated out of the Voids Hand.
  
 “What is it, brat? I was taking a nice nap in here.”
  
 Chu Shen bowed. “Apologies, master. I’m ready to start my training back up again. What should I do first?”
  
 Master Ti Wu shook his head. “No.”
  
 Chu Shen was stunned. “What do you mean, no?”
  
 Master Ti Wu sighed. “Did you forget? I wanted you to scout out the Five Heavenly Mountain Sect when you got back.”
  
 Chu Shen smiled sheepishly. “Yeah, I kinda forgot all about that.”
  
 Master Ti Wu slapped Chu Shen upside the head. “Ungrateful brat! Remember your commitments clearer next time. Anyway, I’ll modify one of the charms that are on your Chains of Transportation. I’ll modify the one that takes you to the Majestic Sword Academy.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “Alright. By the way, why did you choose that charm?”
  
 Master Ti Wu sighed. “Stupid as always, brat. It’s because you can just walk outside and make another one. I would recommend it actually, since you need a way to get back.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “I’ll do that right away, then.”
  
 “While you’re at it, do you want to tell Chrissa, Aslo, and Lucas about your trip? Do you want to take them along?”
  
 Chu Shen thought about it before shaking his head. “I’ll tell them, but it shouldn’t take too long, so I won’t take them with me. They’ll draw more attention than if it’s me by myself.”
  
 Master Ti Wu nodded. “Good choice.”
 
  
 Chu Shen quickly made another charm before gathering his friends together. Then he told them about how he was going to go to a different dimension with Master Ti Wu. They all reacted differently when they found out that Chu Shen wanted to go there alone.
  
 Aslo lost interest in going after finding out that it was simply a scouting mission. Lucas seemed accepting of the fact that Chu Shen wanted to go alone. Chrissa was the only one that seemed to truly want to go with him.
  
 Finally he was able to convince her not go, saying that one person would draw less attention than two. While she accepted his logic, Chrissa was still very reluctant to let him go alone.
  
 He told Master Lang that he was going into closed-door cultivation in order to not complicate things too much. Shortly after, Chu Shen entered his room. Master Ti Wu floated out of the gauntlet. “Are you ready, brat? We are going to my dimension.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “Yeah, I’m ready.”
  
 Master Ti Wu also nodded. “Good.”
  
 He spread his hands. His universe appeared around him, before turning into pure soul energy. The soul energy turned into inscription runes before floating towards a charm on the Chains of Transportation.
  
 The charm started to glow with a bright blue radiance. Rune after rune landed on the charm, causing the inscription on the charm to start to change. About five minutes after Master Ti Wu started the process, something happened.
  
 The charm flashed, and the blue glow turned dark gray. Soon it became a pure black, the black of the void of space. Master Ti Wu waved his hand, causing the charm to float towards him.
  
 He inspected it for a couple seconds before nodding. “It is stable. Channel your Qi into it and you will be teleported to my dimension.” Doing as he said, Chu Shen disappeared from this dimension.
  
 …………………………………………………………………...
  
 When he re-appeared, he was in the middle of a desert. Sand blew into his face as the burning wind blew past him. Chu Shen looked around. “Are we truly in your dimension, Master Ti Wu?”
  
 Master Ti Wu had an arrogant look on his face. “Hmph, doubting your master. The nerve of you, brat. I chose the desert because it is abandoned. No one comes here, and it was very likely that the desert would still be here even after all this time.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “Alright. So what should I do now?”
  
 Master Ti Wu shrugged. “Go look for clues. Pay for information, ask at bars and taverns. Just find out all you can about the Five Heavenly Mountains Sect.”
 
  
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 199 - The Mountain Sect</h1>
  
 BOOM! The loud sound of an explosion rang out, causing sand to fly everywhere. Chu Shen stood in front of a primordial beast. Drawing a dagger at his waist, he cut out the beast core from its stomach before moving on.
  
 Just like Master Ti Wu had said, he’d attempted to go to a local tavern to buy the information. It had taken a bit of travelling for him to find a town in the desert, but he’d found one within an hour or two.
  
 Upon arriving, he had realized he’d forgotten something. Money. Without it, he couldn’t even get in the tavern to ask around. With the beast cores he now had, Chu Shen would finally be able to get some money.
  
 Going back to the town, Chu Shen sold the beast cores before going into the tavern. Sitting down at the bar, he ordered some food. He hadn’t had alcohol before, and he wasn’t planning on starting now. Luckily, this tavern was a part of the local inn, so it wasn’t something out of the ordinary for a person to eat there.
  
 While he was eating, he listened to everyone talking. Unfortunately, he didn’t hear a word about the Five Heavenly Mountain Sect. They were talking about their last hunt and their children's breakthroughs, normal talk.
  
 He still hadn’t heard what he wanted by the time he’d finished his meal. He raised his hand, summoning the bartender. He was a scruffy-looking man, but with a kind face. “What can I do for ya, sonny? Need some wine?”
  
 Chu Shen shook his head. “No. I’m looking for information about a sect.”
  
 The bartender eyed him weirdly before nodding. “Alright sonny, ask away. Though the answers come with a price.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. “Thanks. I want to know about the Five Heavenly Mountain Sect.”
  
 The bartender’s face scrunched up as he started thinking. He shook his head. “Sorry sonny, don’t know about any Heavenly Mountain Sect in these parts. Though, I can send you to an information broker if you’re really interested. They’ve got a whole map of all the sects if you’re just looking for it, some info on most if you’ve got the coin.”
  
 Chu Shen gave him a handful of coins. “Tell me where I can find them.”
  
 The bartender grinned. Soon after, Chu Shen wandered through the town before coming to a tall building. The words “Information Broker” could be seen on the outside. They made no effort to hide themselves.
  
 Chu Shen shrugged. He’d thought they would be in some back alley, but apparently not. Information brokering was a booming business, especially in the cultivation world.
  
 Chu Shen stepped inside. “Welcome, honored customer~!” A receptionist greeted him as he walked inside. “What kind of information are you looking for today?”
  
 Chu Shen decided to cut to the chase. “I’m looking for information on a sect. Its location and power, to be precise.”
 
 The receptionist nodded. “A very common question. Often people want to know what sects they should try out for, and if the one they chose is the correct one. Please follow me, one of our brokers is available now.”
 
  
 Chu Shen followed her to a weird room. The room only had a grated window and a chair in the middle. No one else was in there. “Please sit down, honored customer. The broker will be with you shortly.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded before sitting down. He glanced around while he waited. A minute later he heard the sound of footsteps. What confused him was that the sound was coming from the grated window.
  
 A cough came from the window. “Ahem. I’m the information broker. What is your question for today? Payment will depend on how valuable the information is, so keep this in mind.”
  
 Chu Shen nodded. So this was to protect the identity of the information broker. How cautious! Not only that, but Chu Shen could sense inscriptions that would block soul sense, so it was safe for the broker. “I want information on the Five Heavenly Mountain Sect.”
  
 The broker was quiet. “You are lucky you asked for me. History isn’t the forte of other brokers. As for me, I know what you are asking about.
  
 “The Five Heavenly Mountains Sect has a very complex history starting three thousand years ago. Their founder, Ji Lan, was the first to discover Heavenly Qi. Using this unique Qi, they were able to dominate all other elements.
  
 “Two thousand years ago, this sect faced annihilation from the Void Sect. It was a sect that used Void Qi, the only one that wasn’t affected by the Heavens Qi, and actually suppressed the Heavens Qi
  
 “Finally, seventeen hundred years ago, the Void Sect was annihilated overnight by the combined forces of many high-level sects, including the Five Heavenly Mountains Sect.
  
 “Thirteen hundred years ago, the founding father and patriarch of the Five Heavenly Mountains Sect finally died. Afterwards, internal strife set in. Their fight over the patriarch seat lead to most of their powerhouses dying. The sect became weak from their infighting.
  
 “The sects that had united with them against the Void Sect once again united. Nine hundred years ago, the Five Heavenly Mountains Sect was wiped out, without any survivors. This is the history of the Five Heavenly Mountains Sect.”
  
 Master Ti Wu heard all of it from inside the gauntlet. His face was twisted up with emotion. He wasn’t sure whether to laugh or cry at this outcome. All of the training and caution, all the patience and torment. Seventeen hundred years of waiting, and his enemies were wiped out by their own allies.
  
 The emotions he was feeling couldn’t be described. What was he supposed to do now? What was his reason for continuing to exist if his enemies were already destroyed?
  
 Chu Shen sighed. “Thank you for the information. That’s all I needed.”
  
 “The information isn’t worth much, only ten gold coins. You could have found what you needed if you’d gone to the library. Are you sure there is nothing else you want to ask?”
  
 Chu Shen shook his head, even though the broker couldn’t possibly see him. “No. I’ll pay the receptionist on the way out.”
  
 Chu Shen paid his bill before leaving the town. He made his way into the desert. He prepared the charm that would take him back to his own dimension. He sighed. “I’m sorry, Master Ti Wu.” Then, he disappeared.
  
 
 <h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 200 - Epilogue</h1>
  
 Master Ti Wu found himself a new purpose shortly after coming back. He told Chu Shen that “I want my disciple to be the strongest person, and for the Void Sect to once again shed light on the world.”
  
 True to his master’s belief, Chu Shen recreated the Void Sect. Afterwards, Chu Shen created a school called Industrial Revolution School. Master Lang became the headmaster of the school, a honor he was proud to have.
  
 Lucas helped Master Lang and Chu Shen come up with many different training curricula. Lucas planned out a series of inventions they could introduce. While these wouldn’t have any combat implications, they would be useful for everyday life.
  
 At the school, they introduced these inventions as planned. By using a fire beast core, they were able to create the first steam engine on-campus. This was just the beginning, however. True to the school's name, they started an industrial revolution.
  
 By sharing these ideas, Lucas and Chu Shen were able to raise the standard of living for non-martial artists around their sect to that of the early 1900’s in thirty years. These commoners used coal and wood for the steam engines, though engines powered by beast cores were always more powerful.
  
 Aslo wandered around the world, challenging different sects to fights. He eventually became known as the Fiery Bandit. While he didn’t steal treasures from sects, he stole their pride.
  
 Chrissa became an elder of Chu Shen’s sect and a wonderful teacher, as well. She was praised as one of the kindest people that the world had ever seen.
  
 Chu Lai lived inside the Void Sect, content with her life. She watched quietly as her son started to change the world around her. When Chu Shen offered to unseal her powers, she refused.
  
 If she ever showed that she had the wood element, there would be disastrous consequences. While Chu Shen was powerful, he now had other people to worry about. Even if they couldn’t attack him, they could certainly use the lives of his disciples and students to threaten him.
  
 Chu Lai was determined to never cause a mess like she had the last time. Instead she lived her life peacefully, all six hundred years of it.
  
 Chu Shen continued changing the world. Technology mixed with inscriptions became the norm after a hundred years. New inventions were created and cars were everywhere.
  
 Using Lucas’ foresight, many disasters were stopped. By informing the imperial dynasty of the dangers of pollution and resource exhaustion, many disasters were avoided. Beast cores were considered as renewable resources and were required to be used in all inventions.
  
 The use of coal was relegated to house fires and the occasional locomotive. Chu Shen watched over his sect for the next eight hundred years, becoming an old man. During that period, he married Chrissa. He had two girls and one son, both of whom had the Void Element.
  
 He had watched them grow up and trained them. His oldest daughter took over the headmaster position, after Master Lang died fifty years ago. His son became the sect master thirty years later, and his youngest daughter was out traveling with her uncle Aslo.
  
 Chu Shen watched as a rocket flew upwards into the sky. Master Ti Wu floated beside him. “Are you happy, Chu Shen?” he asked.
  
 Chu Shen thought about the question before smiling. “I’m surrounded by friends and family. I’ve grown far older than I ever thought I would. No one’s out to kill me, and I’ve accomplished far more than I’d ever dreamed.”
  
 He looked up into sky, staring at the moon. “I would say that I’ve lived a wonderful life.”

 Glossary – Chu Shen’s Notes
  
 Chu Shen has luckily written down all of the notes from his class along with any interesting facts he has picked up. As he discovers more he will write down more notes.
 Cultivation Stages Chu Shen knows are separated into 4 realms. The Mortal Realm, Martial Realm, Natural Realm, and Universe Realm.
 Note
 Inside the realms there are different stages, each stage also has 10 levels. There are 8 Major Meridians and inside the meridians is a total of 10 blockages resulting in 10 levels. When the 10th has been cleared the meridian or stage has been mastered. This ranking system was adopted to the other stages as well.
 Note
 Included are the different signs of being in that stage. Emperor stage is unique in that an addition meridian is needed to break through from level 5 to level 6. Almost any meridian can be cleared in any order. However, the first meridian is always the outer meridians. The outer meridians are unlike the other Major Meridians. It is a series of small meridians that must be unblocked. These small meridians also have 10 blockages.

 Ratings for Pills and Weapons Chu Shen knows
 Soul
 The soul is what allows martial artists to control Qi, geniuses have faster soul growth than others. The soul grows fastest in the first 20 percent of a martial artist’s life. As a martial artist becomes more accomplished in their cultivation their lifespan increases, letting them extend their souls growth rate.
 If a person has more Qi inside their body than their soul can handle, their Qi will go out of control and destroy their internal organs or even their cultivation. This is a side effect from raising cultivation through artificial means. Does not apply to those with constitutions. Their souls do not control Qi through normal means and do not have to bear a load when manipulating it. Therefore they don't have issues with their soul losing control. They can only absorb Qi with their element though otherwise their soul will reject it completely and cause them great pain.
 Mental demons or shock may affect a cultivator’s soul. This can lead to cultivators becoming distracted and losing control. In sever cases this can lead to death.  As a result, most cultivators try to be true to themselves and have no worries.
 The only way to cultivate the soul is by learning, fighting, or surviving life-or-death trials. Because of digesting the soul of the plant when eating some medicines, it can result in growth of the soul. However, stabilization of the current cultivation is needed to make the soul their own. Also works with powerful pills and beast spirits. Dangerous because if the soul fragments are too powerful it can even kill the cultivator.
 Martial Arts
 Qi is channeled through the meridians. If the body absorbs too much energy the meridians can burst. It also leaks through the meridians into our body which can lead to backlash if the energy that leaks into the body is too powerful.
 Qi is imprinted by the soul when absorbed, allowing one to use it without meditating. The soul controls Qi and focusing on fine control or controlling large amounts of Qi causes the martial artist to become too distracted.
 Reflexes are done without thinking and is formed by repeating an action until it is ingrained into the body. Martial arts are based off this by making a certain circulation of Qi become a reflex. An example is the body shield of a martial artist, brought on by the body’s survival instinct.
 Training a martial art to the point of being a reflex for your soul, you can activate martial arts requiring large amounts of Qi without being distracted because you do not have to focus. But you must first learn how to channel Qi in those particular meridians, which can be a great roadblock to cultivators.
 Martial arts use certain amounts of meridians to channel their energy. The more meridians used, the more energy can be channeled and spread out without backlash. Of course, these meridians, even for the basic martial art, is over a hundred since the outer meridians are in the millions.
 Qi evaporates when it leaves your body. But by making a structure, you can allow it to hold its form longer. It can also have effects like making blades that slice, shields, increasing your speed, or your bodies strength. But if the structure becomes destabilized the backlash can kill you.
 The reason martial arts are often based off of nature or animals is because by studying the circulation of Qi in animals or plants and how it affects such objects, one can copy the Qi flow and recreate the objects.
  
  
 Mages and Warriors
 In Alteria Qi is called Mana. Mages and warriors are born with an element already, like someone with an innate constitution. Mages are born with a certain amount of Major Meridians already unblocked and call these Mana Rivers.
 Warriors are born with Minor Meridians unblocked and call this the Mana Network. Mages and Warriors cannot unblock anymore meridians besides the one they are born with.
 Warriors expand their meridians size in order to advance Ranks.
 Mages cannot send Qi outside their bodies fast because of the mana river sending in a constant flow of Qi. So they cast spells by mixing their mana with the mana around them. This also makes the spells more powerful than their level should allow but takes time to cast since they need to mix the mana and control it properly.
 Battle Mages are those born with both types of meridians unblocked.
 Mages and Warriors Rank Comparison
 A Mage God was a mage born with all 7 mana rivers while a Warrior God was one that fully expanded their mana network. However, they could only become a rank 8 at best. Only battle mages could become rank 9 and were classified as Paragon Gods.
 Man/Tiger/Dragon = Rank 1
 Student = Rank 2
 Practitioner = Rank 3
 Scholar = Rank 4
 Warrior = Rank 5
 Army = Rank 6
 King = Rank 7
 Emperor (1st part)  = Rank 8
 Emperor (2nd part) = Rank 9
 Mage Casting Classification
 1>Beginning Success: Can cast spell using full chant with spell book.
 2>Small Success: Can chant from memory. (Spell Rank = Mage Rank)
 3> Medium Success: Can use abbreviated chant. (Spell Rank = Mage Rank minus 1 Rank)
 4> Large Success: Can cast using only spell name. (Spell Rank = Mage Rank -2 ranks)
 5> Perfection: Can insta-cast using only mental image. (Spell Rank = Mage Rank -3 ranks)
  
 Rank 6-7 spells only have first 4 stages. God rank (Rank 8-9) spells only have the first 3 stages.
  
 To successfully cast a spell using an abbreviated chant one needs to be one rank above the spell. Using the spell name needed two ranks above the spell and insta-cast needed to be three ranks above the spells rank.
  
 An example would be this. A Rank 5 mage can cast a Beginning/Small success Rank 5 spell. However, they can only cast a Medium Success Rank 4 spell, Large Success Rank 3 spell, and a Perfection Rank 2 spell. The reason behind this spell system was because a higher rank mage could assimilate more Qi with the atmosphere in a shorter amount of time. With that a high rank mage could cast weaker spells almost instantly.
 If mage is insta-casting and becomes distracted, the spell may backfire causing damage to the soul.
