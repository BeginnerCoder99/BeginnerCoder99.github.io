    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Anthony Ellison. I am an aspiring Computer Engineer currently attending Southern Illinois University of Edwardsville. 
        I wish to further my career and gain experience in the STEM field, eventually becoming a senior member of an IT company.
    </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
        I currently hold my Associates of Engineering from Lewis and Clark Community College, graduated in 2024. 
        I am currently in my senior year for my Bachelor's degree at SIUe.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        I have worked as a self-published author from 2016–2018 and as a warehouse worker for Amazon from 2020–2025.
    </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
        I have completed multiple projects while attending school, including website scraping, a customizable battleship game, 
        server-side hosting of a website, and other various projects with the intention of furthering my education.
    </p>

    <h2>Volunteer Work</h2>
    <p>
        In high school (2017–2018), I often volunteered for different activities hosted by East Alton Township. 
        My favorite event was the Soapbox Derby, where small children would ride down hills in wooden boxcars. 
        I helped set up hay bale barriers to prevent crashes and directed traffic at the bottom of the hill.
    </p>

    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        I have various hobbies I enjoy in my spare time. Every Monday for the past six years, 
        I have gathered with friends to play Dungeons and Dragons (DnD), which has taught me cooperation, 
        scheduling, and teamwork. I also play Warhammer 40k, a tabletop game where you paint and battle with your own miniatures. 
        It has taught me valuable skills in painting, strategizing, and studying complex rules.
    </p>
