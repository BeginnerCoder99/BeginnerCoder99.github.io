    <h1 class = "chapter-title">Arc 5 [Desolate World]</h1>

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 131 - Run!</h1>

Chu Shen and Lucas appeared in the middle of that blue grass field once again. Chrissa and Aslo also appeared after Lucas let them out of his pocket dimension. They immediately started looking around.

Aslo looked shocked as he glanced around. “How far did you teleport us? I had no idea grass could be blue. Also, that space you kept us in. There were so many metal things in there. What were they?”

Lucas felt a headache coming. “Uh, well.. you see….. Chu Shen!?”

Chu Shen shook his head. “Nope. This one's all yours, buddy. I got to explain it to you last time.”

Lucas sighed. “Okay. Well, first let me start off with this fact. We are on another world. We have these bracelets, the Chains of Transportation, that let us travel to other worlds. We were both kind of sucked into this on accident and are hitching rides until we reach our original world.”

Chrissa’s eyes were as big as saucers while Aslo just sat there. Finally, he shook his head. “Okay then. So, what are we doing here?”

Lucas shrugged. “We don’t have a goal. We are forced to disappear to another world with no idea when it will happen. As far as we can tell, there is no pattern. We just randomly disappear.”

Aslo seemed to be struggling to come to grips with this new information. “Then what abo-”

A blue flash of light blinded them. Once their eyes adjusted, all of them looked at the area where the light had come from. Standing there was a 33 ft. (10 m) tall, metal scale covered, human-like creature. 

As everyone looked at it in confusion, it pointed its arm at them. Suddenly feeling a sense of danger, Chu Shen summoned the <Universe Shield> and placed it between them and the creature. Not even a second later a beam of white energy shot towards them from the creature’s palm. 

“WHY DO WE ALWAYS GET ATTACKED LIKE THIS!!!!” Lucas yelled to Chu Shen. The sound of crackling was so loud that one had to yell in order to be heard over it.

“IS THIS A COMMON OCCURRENCE THEN?!” Aslo yelled back.

“SHUT UP AND FOCUS! I CAN’T HOLD ON LONG!” Chu Shen yelled at both of them. Immediately Lucas and Aslo’s eyes turned towards Chu Shen’s energy shield. The circular shield was cracked and starting to fade away. It was absorbing the energy from the white beam to repair itself, but not fast enough to offset the damage the beam was doing to it.

Lucas and Aslo immediately became serious, ceasing their chatter. Lucas pulled out his Beast Cannon. “I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO TEST THIS THING. BETTER NOW THAN NEVER!”

The Beast Cannon. It was a long box 4 feet in length with a barrel sticking out of one end. In the middle was a U shaped gap that would fit over Lucas’ shoulder. He aimed the barrel at the creature. Smiling, he fired the Beast Cannon.

A stream of orange and red lava flew towards the creature at three quarters the speed of sound. The outside was solid rock, cooled by the wind. The inside was molten rock, superheated from Qi. These two features combined formed a very formidable weapon.

The creature glanced at the lava projectile. Without any outwards motion, a white barrier appeared in front of it. The projectile smashed into the barrier, causing it to flash brightly and then weaken. The molten projectile bounced off the shield and flew backwards over their heads. Lava smeared onto the barrier and dribbled down it, cooling rapidly.

Lucas gritted his teeth. “Oh yeah!? That was only at five percent. Take this! Full power blast!”

The lava projectile shot out once more. It was now white hot and made a sonic boom as it flew towards the creature. This time, the white barrier wasn’t able to stop the projectile. It smashed through and hit the creature.

The creature flew backwards through the air and hit the side of a building, cracking it. The creature lay slumped against the side of the building, completely still. Lucas was just about to cheer when the creature shifted. It grabbed the black hunk of rock from where it was jammed into its abdomen. 

With a quick jerk, the rock became dislodged. The creature threw the rock behind it. Its stomach now had cracks in its metal scales. The lava left scorch marks on some of its scales as it trailed down its body. Everyone’s faces immediately became serious.

A soft girl's voice suddenly sounded behind Chu Shen, causing him to turn around. It was Chrissa! “Wind focus and shape. Take form before me. Create what I want through this fragile will of mine. Go forth, Wind Scythe Hurricane!” 

The Rank 7 spell formed around the creature, creating a hurricane around it. Hundreds of blades of wind struck the creature all over its body in a matter of seconds. Sparks flew from the mana-infused wind, striking the metal scales of the creature. The white barrier appeared around the creature again, but it was quickly shattered by the onslaught of wind scythes.

Aslo decided he wasn’t just going to watch though. “I’ll help you sis! Flames of the world, converge in front of me. Burn those who I want to destroy, and protect those I wish to protect. Flames take form, Fiery Sun!” A huge ball of flame appeared around the creature, consuming it. The hurricane around it caused the ball of flame to become even bigger. The magic spells synergized together very well, creating a Rank 8 spell from the two Rank 7 spells.

Chu Shen grimaced while watching them. There was no way he could join in. His Qi would just absorb their spells. Honestly, he was better for melee attacks and defensive maneuvers. He would get in the way of everyone else if he tried attacking now.

Lucas also didn’t stand idly by. “You can take one full power blow, but how about ten?!” He hoisted his Beast Cannon up and aimed at the center of the fireball. Immediately, several lava projectiles slammed into the creature. It hadn’t been doing nothing and had started to try and close the distance between them. 

With the lava projectiles slamming into it, the creature was forced back into the building, causing it to crack even more. Surprisingly, the building was still standing. The twins’ spells, which had been active for a minute already, were starting to falter. They had enough mana to sustain the spells, but the concentration required was another matter.

Multiple sniper drones appeared around Lucas, though several of them appeared far bigger than the others. Chu Shen quickly covered his ears and none too soon. The air shook from over forty sonic booms occurring at once. Aslo and Chrissa winced at the unexpected sound. Their spells became disrupted as they were distracted.

Lucas glanced over apologetically before turning back towards the creature. Right now they could finally see it clearly since it wasn’t covered in fire or dust now. Lucas and Chu Shen gasped when they saw it while the twins seemed confused.

The creature was severed in half, the upper body pinned against the wall by several rock shards. The lower half lay on the ground motionless. That wasn’t what was making them so shocked, however. It was the wires that were spilling out of the creature’s abdomen. Or rather, the robot’s abdomen. 

Lucas grimaced slightly. “Sorry to destroy such a fine piece of equipment like this, but…” Another volley of projectiles launched from the sniper drones, causing the twins to flinch once again. The robot’s head shattered into fragments of metal and unidentified materials. 

Lucas turned to Chu Shen. “So, what did you think of that?”

Several flashes of blue light suddenly went off. Turning around, Lucas saw five more robots that were identical to the first appear out of nowhere. Another robot standing at 49 ft. (15 m) tall appeared as well. It was identical to the others except for its right arm, which was a barrel instead of a hand. It also had what appeared to be a backpack on.

Aslo seemed shaken. “So what do we do now!?”

Chu Shen grabbed his and Chrissa’s hands. “Well, we do what one always does in the face of imminent death.”

“RUN!!!!”



<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 132 - Confusion</h1>

It turns out that the giant robot didn’t have a backpack on. Instead, it had on a missile launcher, which it was currently using to launch missiles at them. All the while, white beams of energy from the other, smaller ones shot towards them.

Lucas had put Aslo and Chrissa inside his pocket dimension while he strapped on his jetpack. He flew through air while trying to dodge missiles that were constantly exploding around him. Chu Shen was able to keep pace with the jetpack by using <Comet Travels Through: Dust Trail>. Just like the technique said, he left a trail of dust from the rock he crushed to powder with his feet and threw into the air with every step. 

He may have been in danger of getting weary, except for one thing. The smaller robots were targeting him with their energy beams. Using his <Cancellation Armor>, Chu Shen was able absorb the energy beams and keep himself at full capacity. At the moment, it looked like a stalemate.

Deep, deep underground, less than five hundred feet from the mantle of the planet, sat a bunker. Inside this bunker was a series of large memory banks, comprising the brain of the A.I. that dwelled there. Currently, the A.I. was monitoring a very concerning situation.

………………………………………………..

 Chu Shen and Lucas had been fleeing from the robots for about ten minutes. The larger one had run out of missiles. Instead, it started launching plasma balls at Lucas from the barrel it had in its hand. The plasma balls would explode on impact with anything else. Chu Shen had discovered that tidbit when he used <Universal Shield> to protect Lucas when he was about to be hit.

“HEY LUCAS! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THESE KILLER ROBOTS!” Chu Shen yelled at Lucas so he could hear him over the sounds of combat.

Lucas swooped over Chu Shen while doing a barrel roll to avoid several plasma balls. “I’M NOT SURE! MOST OF MY WEAPONS ARE GEARED TOWARDS PEOPLE, NOT ROBOTS. OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE USED AN EMP OR ION CANNON.”

Suddenly, all of the robots stopped firing. Chu Shen and Lucas glanced over their shoulders. The robots were now standing completely still. There was a flash of blue light. The robots were gone.

Lucas slowly landed beside Chu Shen. “What just happened?” Lucas sounded confused.

Chu Shen shrugged helplessly. “I’m not sure. Several giant robots attacked us for no reason and then left.”

“Soooo…...What do we do now?”

“First we need to find a place to stay. We also need to be able to lose those robots if they appear again. Lucas, can you fly up high and get a good look around?”

Lucas smiled. “I can do better than that. Here, let me launch my satellite first. We can find a suitable place with that.”


The satellite appeared before Chu Shen and Lucas. Immediately, it started flying upwards. Lucas grinned. “Soon, I should get some images.” As he said that, he stored all of his sniper drones back inside his subspace pocket.


…………………………………………………..

Hostiles have launched an orbital reconnaissance vehicle. Action determined as possibly dangerous. Match probability raises to 54.821%. Must eliminate orbital reconnaissance vehicle. Activating orbital weapon platform.

…………………………………………………..

At approximately 420 miles (32 km) above the planet, there was a 1 mile (1.6 km) diameter sphere. A bay door slid open on the side of the sphere that faced the planet, and a long barrel emerged from the open hatch. The sphere rotated slightly before firing its weapon. A beam of white hot plasma shot out of the barrel down towards the planet’s surface.

The barrel receded back into the sphere. Once it was back inside the sphere, the bay door slid back into place. The sphere was once again silent, floating through the void of space.

………………………………………………….

Lucas had deployed his holo-drone so Chu Shen could see what the satellite was seeing. “Look at this, Chu Shen. It’s a city! Not a sprawling town but a city, with skyscrapers and everything! Wow, this planet is pretty amazing. It’s similar to my own realm, actually. Anyway, we need to decide where to go.”

Chu Shen nodded. “A city would be the best place. We might be able to find someone that can explain the random robot attacks to us. Plus, the city will provide lots of places to avoid the robots if they attack us again.”

Lucas nodded in agreement. “Alright then. We’re here, and the nearest town is here. We would need to go this direction in order to rea- Hey!” Suddenly, the satellite view of the ground disappeared.

“Uh oh. I lost contact with the satellite. I have no idea what went wrong though.” Lucas was befuddled at this turn of events.

Chu Shen hit him in the arm. When Lucas looked at him, he pointed behind him. “Lucas, I think I found out what it was that destroyed your satellite.”

Lucas turned to look where Chu Shen was pointing. “I don’t see why you assume it was destroyed. What could possibly give you that ideaaaaa………… Never mind. I see it.”

A white beam of plasma could be seen streaking through the atmosphere a mile away from them. Chu Shen watched as the plasma hit the ground and chewed right through it, as if nothing was there.

Chu Shen watched it for a while before sighing. “Alright then, Lucas. We need to get a move on.”

Lucas grinned. He grabbed onto the unsuspecting Chu Shen’s arm before suddenly taking off. 

“NOOOOTTTTT AAAAGGGGAAAAIIIIIINNNN LLLUUUUCCCCAAASSSS!!!!” Chu Shen screamed as he was dragged behind Lucas.

“NO WORRIES CHU SHEN! I JUST THOUGHT WE NEEDED TO GET THERE QUICKLY! HAHAHAHA!”

……………………………………………

The hostiles did not have a major reaction to the destruction of their orbital reconnaissance vehicle. The hostiles are currently moving towards Gu’lt. Continuing observation of the hostiles.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 133 - Abandoned</h1>

After the abrupt takeoff, Chu Shen adapted to Lucas’ flight. It wasn’t his first rodeo after all. As they flew towards the city, Lucas expressed some concerns. “Those mechs back there aren’t natural. It’s obvious they were made by somebody, along with the weapon that destroyed my satellite. I’m afraid whoever lives in this city may have more powerful weapons. That could be why the mechs retreated; since we’re going right to them, why should they continue after us?”

Chu Shen shrugged, a gesture Lucas could feel from his grip on Chu Shen. “I’m not sure, but I can say this. I would rather try to negotiate with the person controlling the weapon then to fight the weapon. Maybe we can strike a deal with them.”


Lucas rolled his eyes. “Like that’ll ever happen. It never works out like that in the movies.”


Chu Shen hit Lucas in the leg. “Good thing this isn’t a movie.”

Lucas waved his arm around a bit, causing Chu Shen to shake back and forth. “You wanna fall from here, huh? Cause from where I’m flying, it looks like you really want to.”

“STOP IT LUCAS!” Chu Shen smacked Lucas’ hand away, falling below him. Immediately Lucas panicked and dived after him.

“Crap crap CRAP! Chu Shen you crazy sonovagun!” Lucas was just about to catch up to Chu Shen when a round circle of energy appeared below Chu Shen’s feet. Chu Shen pushed off that circle of white light and shot upwards, passing Lucas.

Using his tremendous strength, Chu Shen traveled quite fast. Another circle of white energy appeared beneath his feet which he used to propel himself upwards and forwards. His speed actually matched Lucas’ cruising speed on the jetpack!

Lucas, stunned as he was from this surprise, immediately turned around. “CHU SHEN!!!” He yelled as he opened the throttle on his jetpack. Immediately he shot after Chu Shen. Right as he caught up, Chu Shen jumped upwards while doing a flip, causing his head to become oriented towards Lucas. Kicking off another circle of light, Chu Shen shot towards Lucas and grabbed his neck.

Lucas wobbled from the impact and additional weight before stabilizing his flight. “Chu Shen! Are you crazy?! You could’ve died!” He yelled at Chu Shen. 

Chu Shen shrugged. “I just got tired of you always shaking me. Come on, doesn’t it get old? Normally I could put up with it, but this isn’t the time to goof off. We’re in a situation where we don’t know who we are facing or their strength. Get it together, we need to be serious.”


Lucas was stunned at this. “Why didn’t you just say that instead of making me drop you? Also, how did you stop falling?”

Chu Shen sighed. “With your joking temperament, you wouldn’t have taken me seriously unless I did something shocking. As for me stopping my falling, it was naturally due to <Stars Dance: Light Step>. Remember that with it I can make my Qi solid and create a stepping stone in mid-air.”

“I don’t ever remember you having that ability.”

“Really? I thought I told you. I learned it while training back at the second magic beast hunting zone.”

“Nope. You never told me about what you did while training.”

“Huh. I guess I’ll have to show you everything eventually.”

Lucas suddenly saw the city they had been flying towards. “Hey Chu Shen, I can see the city.”

Chu Shen immediately became excited. “Quick, tell me what kind of people are in the city, what kind of activity is there?”

“What do you mean tell you about the city? I can just see a black smudge over the horizon! It’ll take at least another ten minutes before I can see details.”

Chu Shen sighed. “All right then. Tell me when you can then.” After some impatient humming and tapping on Lucas’ head, Lucas could finally see the city. What he saw though confused him.

 “That’s odd.”


Chu Shen hit him on head. “What’s odd?”

Lucas rubbed the back of his head. “Ouch. Not so hard next time. Anyways, remember those buildings we saw when we first came here?”


Chu Shen nodded. “Yeah. They were white and had scorch marks all over them.”

“Well these skyscrapers are the same. White with scorch marks. There are some holes in the buildings as well, and some look like they’ve started melting.”

“Hmm. That is odd. We’ll need to look at them more closely when we get there.”

Soon, Lucas and Chu Shen arrived at the bustling, unknown city. Well, it wasn’t a bustling city. It was a ghost town. Not a single animal or person could be seen. Melted vehicles of some sort littered the streets. The shells of the vehicles were twisted and warped, looking like boxes out of a Picasso painting. 

Lucas and Chu Shen picked their way through the area, studying the wreckage that was strewn about the ghost town. “The Qi concentration is very intense here. It might be one of those realms that is very dense in Qi, like the ones Master Ti Wu told me about.” Chu Shen remarked.

Lucas shrugged. “I have no idea about that, but my Geiger Counter is going nuts. This much radiation is like being ten miles from a thermonuclear bomb. No regular human could survive this and my positronic brain is only safe because of the radiation shielding I put inside my body.”


Chu Shen saw a large, dome-shaped building with a large sign in front of him. The sign was made of unrecognized characters. The characters were harsh, angular lines and he only recognized it as a sign because of the placement. He pointed towards the sign. “Hey Lucas, can you read that sign?”

Lucas turned back towards Chu Shen. Glancing back at where Chu Shen was pointing at, he cocked his head sideways. “Maybe, let me run my translation program real quick… Yep. It’s weird though. The characters are actually Nugitraaiilian.” Chu Shen looked at him blankly. “Remember those lizard aliens you faced in the RoboGames back on my planet?”

“Oh yeah. They were kind of annoying, going on about having to learn from the person that beat them because of their ‘honor’. Still, it’s really weird that their language popped up here of all places.”

Lucas became excited as a possibility. “Wait, could this mean I’m back in my universe?”

Chu Shen shrugged. “No idea. I doubt it, but I don’t control where we go, so who knows? Anyways, what did the sign say?” 

“The sign said ‘Planetary Defense Command Center.’ Let me activate the Tachyon comm relay so that we can try and contact Sparta.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 134 - Mystery</h1>

Lucas sighed. “Nope. No signal back. It seems as though I still have to travel with you.”


Chu Shen hit him in the side. “You’re not getting away from me that easy. We’re sticking together until we can both get home.”


Lucas gave him a sad grin. “Well, it sure does look that way.”

Chu Shen glanced around for something to distract Lucas with. He remembered that building from earlier and immediately zoomed in on it. “Hey Lucas, think we can go explore that command center with Aslo and Chrissa? They’ll get bored if they stay in there much longer.”

Lucas suddenly remembered Aslo and Chrissa were still inside his pocket dimension. “Oh yeah. I should probably let them out.”

Aslo and Chrissa suddenly appeared in front of them. As soon as Aslo appeared he jumped towards Lucas and hit him in the arm. “What is up with everybody hitting me today!” Lucas rubbed his arm and glared at everyone.

“Hey!” Aslo got right up in Lucas’ face. “Just because you’re one of the saviors doesn’t mean I can’t hit you. We came along to repay you, not to get transported around like some sword inside your Spatial Bag or whatever you have! Come on! How can we help you if we can’t even face some danger with you!”

Chu Shen sighed. “Aslo, while it’s true that you could have helped out, all you would have been able to do was flee with us. Unlike you though, Lucas can fly without massive energy drain. Because of that, he stayed behind, as did I, because I could help him block things from a distance.”


“But still, we could have-”


“Enough!” Chu Shen finally had enough. “We called you out because we thought you were bored, not to have an argument. Anyways, we were going to go inside that building over there to see if we could figure out why this town was abandoned.”


Aslo finally looked around him. “WHAT! That building…… It’s as tall as a mountain! So is that one! Sis! Look at all these huge buildings! Chu Shen, what kind of magical place is this?”


Chu Shen smiled. “It’s not magical Aslo. It’s the city.”

Chrissa approached Lucas and spoke shyly to him. “So, why would this building answer why the town was abandoned?” 

“Well because it’s the command center for the planet’s military.” He explained casually.

She nodded before whispering. “So this town’s name is ‘planet’?”

“Hmm? Oh, no it’s not. The term planet is used for celestial bodies that orbit the sun. We are currently on a planet right now.”

Chrissa glanced at the ground and then pointed up at the sun. 

Lucas facepalmed. “I’ll explain this later. Chu Shen! Are we going inside?”


Chu Shen nodded. “Yeah, let’s go in now.”

Soon after Chu Shen and the gang went towards the Planetary Defense Command Center. It took them multiple tries to enter. Chu Shen had to smash a hole through the door for them to gain access to the building. Upon entering the smell of death and decay was heavy.

Glancing around Chu Shen saw bodies strewn across the halls as though they had died mid-stride. Mildewed clothes and bones could be seen. Only small bits of flesh hadn’t decayed yet on the bodies. There was some things that were really puzzling though. There were scales littered around the bodies. The bones also didn’t match those of a human. The fingers were longer than a human’s and the mouth was filled with needle-like teeth.

Lucas ignored the dead bodies and went over to one of the walls. A compound map was there. “Follow me, the tactical room is this way.” Everyone followed Lucas, though Chrissa walked far away from any of the bodies. They walked through several rooms and hallways, all with a body or two at least, before arriving at a large room. Inside the room was a large mushroom shaped stand.

Lucas immediately discovered it was a holo-projector. Going over to it, Lucas pressed the button labeled power. Nothing happened. He flipped open a panel on his arm and a cable emerged from it. He cut open several cables leading to the holo-display before discovering the one that carried power to it. He spliced the power cable with the one from his arm before supplying it with power.

Suddenly the entire room was lit up with a blue 3D display. There was the image of a solar system with ten planets floating in front of them with the sun of the system above the holo-projector. There were ships surrounding the fifth planet from the sun. There was only four or five of them and they seemed to be headed away from the planet.

Out by the ninth planet was a massive cloud of spaceships. Some were bright blue and others a blood red color. The red ships far outnumbered the blue. There were also blue, human shaped icons scattered amongst them.

The most eye catching thing though was a large white ribbon that was right next to the fifth planet. The holographic image of it was pixelated and distorted, as though something had been interfering with the image.

Aslo and Chrissa both jumped upon seeing this hologram appear out of nowhere. “What is this Chu Shen?!” He asked pointing at it.

Chu Shen sighed. This was starting to get really tiring. It seemed as though they would have to receive a lesson in technology from him and Lucas ASAP. “This is a hologram. Essentially it creates an image.” He couldn’t say 3D since they had no idea what 3D represented.

Aslo nodded. “So like a soul projection then? It’s a Rank 4 Light Spell. So, are you a light mage then?”

Chu Shen shook his head. “No. There are machines that can replicate the effects of certain spells. There are a couple branches of creating magic tools and technology is one of them. The Technology Branch of magic tools creates machines that anyone at any level can use. This mushroom thing is a machine that can replicate the soul projection spell.”

“Wow! That’s pretty cool!” Aslo immediately focused on the mushroom object. While he did that, Chu Shen approached Lucas. 

“Is there anyway to find out what this image means?” He asked Lucas.

Lucas nodded. “Right now I’m hacking the database for the holo-projector. According to the records I have access to now, they were invaded. About a year before the records ended unknown ships started attacking them. They didn’t have Hyperspace Engines so their FTL (Faster-Than-Light) capabilities were severely hampered, though they did have Tachyon comm systems. The enemy would warp in at the edge of their solar system in droves and attack them. No messages were ever exchanged and their ships were unmanned.”

Lucas suddenly gasped. His head immediately turned towards the fifth planet. He pointed at the mysterious ribbon. “I know what that is.”

“It’s a solar flare.”


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 135 - Destruction</h1>

Match probability rises to 79.674%.  Threat level is now irrelevant. Assigning Assault Unit #12 to erase hostiles. Preparing Assault Unit #12. Time until dispatch is 1 minute, 57 seconds, 32 microseconds.

……………………………

Chu Shen nodded. “A solar flare, of course! That would explain the interference the holo-display showed around it. The intense electromagnetic energy would have disrupted any long-range scanners.”

Aslo was confused on the other hand. “Uh, what is a solar flare exactly?”

Lucas, who was busy studying some records he had found, answered unconsciously. “It’s when a sun sends massive surges of radiation outwards, but this solar flare is way outside normal specs. As a matter of fact, I would say it might even be engineered. We have devices that can disrupt a sun's magnetic field, creating a solar flare in the area we want.”

The hologram changed suddenly. There were now slightly more blue ships, but there was a hole in their formation that was blocking an army of red ships. Lucas pointed at the hologram, explaining some of his concerns to Chu Shen while Aslo and Chrissa looked on in confusion.

“If you look at this right here, you can see where those alien invaders managed to get ten ships past the blockade. They sent half of them towards this planet, which were destroyed before even coming close, and the others were sent towards the sun. They flew right into the sun, essentially committing suicide. I believe they managed to deliver a weapon that caused the solar flare. This was two days before the solar flare actually happened.”

He closed his eyes for a second before sighing. “I calculated the trajectory of the planet relative to the solar flare. It should have been a direct hit. The ionosphere of the planet wouldn’t have been able to handle such immense amounts of radiation. The radiation would have been able to leak through to the planet's surface, killing every single living thing on the planet. 

“It does appear as though the Nugitraaiil did anticipate something like this happening. They had isolated bunkers set up for every major city, which is probably why we didn’t see any dead bodies in the street. They would have been able to withstand direct hits from nuclear bombs, and they had forcefields set up. Unfortunately, the solar flare would have caused radiation far beyond the bunkers’ ability to withstand. They would have died soon after the solar flare hit, a day at the most.

“I don’t know how long ago the solar flare happened, but it should have been at least five hundred years ago. Otherwise, the radiation wouldn’t have diminished this much.”

Aslo and Chrissa were both completely lost at this moment. Radiation, bunkers, nuclear bombs… All of this was far beyond their understanding. “Sooo. Does this mean everyone is dead?” Aslo finally asked.

Chu Shen nodded. “Yes it does.”

Chrissa gasped before covering her mouth. She turned away, a small tear trickling down her cheek. Aslo shook his head silently, his face grim. They had just managed to gain revenge for their sect, which had almost been wiped out. The Nugitraaiil had truly been wiped out, down to the last man. No wonder the twins empathized with these aliens so deeply.

Chu Shen sighed at the twins’ emotional outburst before continuing to converse with Lucas about the specifics of the records. “So do we have any records about after the solar flare?”

Lucas shook his head. “No. Well actually, that isn’t accurate. There is a report here about the forcefield that kept the Tactical Room isolated from the outside, which is the only reason why there are still computer records. If there hadn’t been a forcefield, then the electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, would have wiped the systems data and we wouldn’t have found anything.

“The initial electromagnetic force disrupted the power supply for the forcefield. It was able to use batteries to keep it up for another day before running out of energy. However, the Tactical Center lost contact with all facilities outside, effectively cutting them off. That’s what I meant when I say we don’t have any records after the solar flare. We know what happened inside this room but not what happened outside. The officers in the tactical room committed suicide by leaving the forcefield early, which is why there aren’t any dead bodies inside.”

Chu Shen and Lucas looked at each other. What would they do with this information?

Assault Unit #12 is ordered to activate normal drives. ETA to Planetary Defense Command Center is 3 minutes, 39 seconds, 1,200 microseconds.

………………………………….

Chu Shen, Lucas, Aslo, and Chrissa decided to go around the rest of the Planetary Defense Command Center looking for further information. As they walked next to each other, Lucas brought up some of his concerns to Chu Shen.

He had on a concerned expression as he talked to Chu Shen. “This just isn’t adding up. The Nugitraaiil are a species that live in my galaxy. They’ve always been very secretive about their past but we’ve had contact with them for three hundred years. Yet here, in an alternate dimension, we find traces of their existence. The same genetic make-up and the same language, all of which couldn’t be faked. This just brings up so many questions.”

Chu Shen shrugged. “Maybe they discovered a way to travel to different dimensions?”

Lucas shook his head. “No, it can’t be that. If they discovered something like that then they would need the ability to manipulate black holes. My dad, Xentus Viri, was just starting to experiment with them whenever we left.”

Chu Shen threw up his hands. “I don’t know then. I have no clue as to how they were able to appear in a completely different dimension. On the other hand, we’ve already been to two other dimensions where there are humans that speak the same language as me. Maybe it’s like that, and the Nugitraaiil just coincidentally appeared in both dimensions.”

……………………………….

Assault Unit 12 has located the hostiles. Hostiles are currently inside the Planetary Defense Command Center. Dispatching Drone Scouts #1, #2, and #3. Mission goal, termination of hostiles. 






<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 136 - Scouts</h1>

Lucas couldn’t accept coincidence. No matter how hard he tried. “There is no way that we just happened to appear on a planet with humans on it. Or that there was an alien species that has just so happened to appear on two of the realms we have visited. Though it’s more like finding the remains of an alien species than actually finding one at all in this case.”

Chu Shen shrugged. “The multiverse is a strange thing. That’s all I can say.”

“You can’t just dismiss one of the greatest mysteries we’ve encountered by saying, ‘that's the way it works.’ We have to try and analy-”

Right as Lucas was just starting to rant, the door behind them exploded. Shards of metal flew through the air towards the group. Body shields appeared over the twins and Chu Shen. Lucas covered his head to keep his eyes from being scratched out. Turning towards the explosion, Chu Shen groaned.

There, in the doorway, was a small, adult-size robot. It was gray with pistons visible. A blue shield could be seen shimmering just above the surface of the robot. Its right arm was a barrel, glowing slightly red. Its left arm was blade shaped and was making a humming sound. As Chu Shen was observing this robot, a red bolt of energy shot towards him. Chu Shen activated his <Cancellation Armor>.

The red bolt of energy hit Chu Shen and exploded, sending him flying back into the walls. He hit the wall, causing cracks to spread from where he hit it. At the same time, his armor faded slightly. 

Lucas reacted immediately and fired a fireball from his hand. “Fireball Barrage! Go!” Aslo also sent over twenty fireballs using the Rank 3 Spell Fireball Barrage. “Wind Scythe! Go!” Chrissa sent a razor-sharp blade of wind directly at the robot.

Even though the wind blade was launched last, it reached the robot first. The wind scythe hit the robot, piercing its blue shield. A gouge appeared on the chest of the robot from where the wind blade struck. Lucas’ fireball landed next. It hit the robot and exploded, sending it flying backwards. The internals of the robot, which had been exposed by the wind blade, were now damaged slightly by the fireball.

Now it was Aslo’s turn. His fireballs were half the size of Lucas’ and the fire wasn’t as intense. However, what it lacked in individual power, it made up in numbers. The first fireball slammed into the robot, causing it to fly backwards at even greater speed straight into a wall. Nineteen more fireballs slammed into the robot, keeping it pinned against the wall.

After the last fireball slammed into the robot, everything was still. Chu Shen picked himself up from where he had landed after being slammed into the wall. The robot stood there, its arms hanging limp by its sides. Its head suddenly came up, staring right at Lucas. Its right arm came up, sending ten bolts of energy in less than a second.

The <Universe Shield> appeared in front of Lucas, blocking the attacks. The shield cracked as the bolts of energy exploded, but it didn’t break. Chu Shen disappeared before reappearing next to the robot. A hammer had appeared in his hand at some point in time. The wind whistled as Chu Shen swung the hammer brutally at the robot’s midsection. 

Chu Shen. A martial artist with a void constitution. He didn’t have great attacking techniques. His defense techniques relied mostly on his unique Qi. His speed was superb. However, his one greatest talent was this. Bodily strength.

The hammer smashed into the robot, severing it in half. The hammer passed through the robot as though it was nothing, smashing into the wall behind it. The hammer put a hole through the wall, completely demolishing a good portion of it. Taking a step back, Chu Shen yanked his hammer back.

Aslo clapped. “Now I know how you became the savior.”

Lucas hit him over the head. “Knock it off with the savior thing. We’re all partners now.” He turned towards Chu Shen. 

“So those mechs weren’t the only robots here. I think that was a drone scout. They were made by the Nugitraaiil to scout out buildings for the giant mechs they preferred to use so that they could confirm if there was hostiles inside. If there’s one here, that means there’s mechs that are still waiting for us.”

Chu Shen scratched his head. “How exactly do you know all this?”

Lucas shrugged. “I haven’t been just wasting my time you know. I’ve been busy gathering data from the servers as we passed by. Luckily this building was made to protect itself from orbital bombardments. Most of the data is corrupted, but some of it can be salvaged. Their ground assault methods were inside.”

Lucas peered at the robot. “Though, these things didn’t have a shield in the specs I saw. Also, the energy cannon seems to be a lot more powerful than in the blueprints. It might be a prototype that was stored here and was activated once we entered the compound.”

Chu Shen nodded. “That is a possibility. However, it would be better if we acted as though there is a mech outside. If the mech starts attacking in here then we’ll be at a disadvantage. It’s too cramped. We need to get outside.”

Lucas nodded as well. “Alright then. Let’s go. We can get back to the entrance and leave that way.”

They all followed Lucas, since he remembered how to leave. They encountered two more drone scouts on the way. Chu Shen, who was towards the front, would hit them one time with his hammer. All that would be left behind of the drone scouts were mangled parts.

After ten minutes, they had finally reached the entrance. They all took up their positions. Aslo and Chrissa chanted spells underneath their breath, preparing the mana but not casting it. On the count of three, all of them rushed out into the deserted streets.

Everything was quiet. Nothing moved, no one spoke. All of them exchanged glances before splitting up. Looking around, it truly seemed as though no mechs were around.

Aslo let out a sigh of relief. “Looks like we’re good!”

Right after Aslo said that, there was a wumph sound. Immediately after that, there was a loud bang from behind them. Turning around, there was a large mech standing between them and the command center.

It was just as tall as the previous mechs they had faced. However, this one was completely black. Small turrets with barrels poking out could be seen dotting its body. All of the turrets swiveled, locking onto all four of them. It had four arms with two large guns attached to its shoulders.

Lucas facepalmed. “Why’d you have to say that, Aslo?”




<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 137 - Fight!</h1>

The turrets fired at them, filling the air with bolts of red energy. They were similar to the energy bolts the drone scouts had used, but they seemed to be far more powerful when compared to them. Chu Shen hurriedly created several shields to protect his friends. Using <Stars Dance: Light Step>, Chu Shen ran up to the mech.

He ran like he was running on steps, going up towards the mech’s face. Several hundred energy bolts came at him and his friends in just ten seconds. Most of them were absorbed by his shields, giving his friends time to react before they broke. 

Lucas immediately flew up into the air, using fire from his legs. Aslo and Chrissa were able to avoid everything using their proficiency as an Early Stage Martial Emperor.

Chu Shen quickly reached the mech. Swinging his hammer, he smashed it into the shoulder of the robot. A white barrier, just like the one the other robot had before, appeared. It was no match for Chu Shen’s strength.

With a loud BANG, the robot spun around from the impact of the blow. Bolts of energy flew everywhere as the robot swung around. The robot fell down onto the ground. It immediately started grasping around, attempting to pull itself back up.

They weren’t going to let it do that, though. Lucas deployed his sniper drones. They immediately started firing at the joints of its right leg. Wind surged towards the robot, keeping it pinned down on the floor. Flames billowed over the entire mech, causing its exterior to become cherry red.

While this was going on, Chu Shen got busy. Protected by his Qi, he was able to stand directly on the robot’s back while not worrying if he would be caught in the crossfire. Using his hammer, he repeatedly bashed the back of the mech’s head. This continued for half a minute. 

Then, a large beam of red energy struck Chu Shen in the back. Chu Shen was flung into the robot, his body shield breaking when he did. Chu Shen screamed and glanced down at his right leg. A five inch hole was bored completely through it. Lucas, who had shot both of the mech’s legs off and was starting on the left arm, immediately became alarmed.

Looking up, he saw three more robots exactly like the one that was fighting them. “Crap. Chrissa! Grab Chu Shen! We need to get out of here!” Chrissa nodded and started chanting. Chu Shen floated upwards on a draft of wind shaped like a brick. He was flown straight to Chrissa. She grabbed him and immediately started running.

Lucas and Aslo sent multiple barrages of fireballs up at the mechs. Lucas pulled out his Beast Cannon and fired the lava projectiles straight at them. The guns mounted on their shoulders fired large red beams just like the one that had hit Chu Shen. 

Four of them lanced towards Lucas, cutting off both his legs. One was directed at Aslo who barely managed to dodge it by throwing himself on the ground. There was one more gun that hadn’t fired but supposedly it was cooling down from firing at Chu Shen.

The four arms on one of the robots split open. A glob of blue plasma shot forward towards Lucas. Lucas gritted his teeth before firing a lava projectile straight at it. The both met mid-air and exploded. The plasma vaporized the rocky outside before colliding with the molten inner core. The lava and plasma met in a violent collision before exploding.

The Beast Cannon couldn’t continue firing at full power for long, though. Three more plasma balls shot towards Lucas. Lucas was able to stop two, but the third one made it through. The lava projectiles just didn’t have enough power. Right before the plasma ball hit him, Lucas teleported the Beast Cannon into his pocket dimension. His body outside was vaporized. 

“LUCAS! NOOO!” Aslo immediately freaked out. He started chanting a Rank 8 Spell, Apocalyptic Shower. Before he finished it though, Lucas suddenly appeared. “Lucas?” Aslo asked incredulously. “I thought you were dead!”


Lucas shrugged his shoulders. “Well, I may be just slightly immortal. Anyways, we need to leave before you get killed.” Lucas had teleported one of his spare bodies outside, of course.

A turret appeared next to Lucas. It had an X shaped bottom and a blast shield wrapped around the barrel. Lucas activated it and identified the three robots as enemies. The robot they had first attacked wasn’t able to get off the ground so far, so Lucas designated it as a low threat enemy.

The turret swiveled towards the closest mech and unleashed multiple small globs of plasma. Lucas took off running, his jetpack appearing around his back. Flying upwards, he grabbed Aslo around his shoulders and got out of there. 

Up ahead, Lucas could see Chrissa flying as well. A miniature hurricane had formed below her legs, propelling her through the air. Aslo had flames appear below his legs, allowing him to break Lucas’ grip and fly as well.

“Oh great. No one needs a friendly jetpack anymore, do they.” Lucas grumbled. He turned around and glanced back at the turret. As he did, he witnessed the turret disappearing in a flare of red light. The three mechs flew through the air after them. A fourth one also appeared, though it was missing its lower body.

Miniature missiles shot out of the mech's arms after them. Lucas sighed. “This day is getting better and better.” His sniper drones started to pick them off, one by one. There were over fifty missiles that had been launched at them. The missiles started doing tricks to avoid his shots. They were doing barrel rolls, zig-zags, and every other aerial trick in the book to dodge his fire.

It was pointless, however. The missiles were all destroyed before reaching Lucas, though the last one was way too close for comfort. The mechs, however, were closing fast. They were a lot faster then the last ones that had come after them, and were far more heavily armed. The lasers and energy bolts attenuated too much in the atmosphere to fire at them from a distance, so they were safe for a little while. They were half a mile apart whenever the lasers started back up once again.

Lucas gritted his teeth. It looked as though he was going to have to teleport them into his pocket dimension. Most likely they were going to have to go back to Aslo and Chrissa’s realm once again.

Suddenly he heard Chu Shen say something. “Hey Lucas, do you think it’s possible to talk to the mechs?”

Lucas blinked. “What?”

“Well, I mean, isn’t this supposed to be a Nugitraaiil planet? So maybe these machines are leftovers from that war we saw. Maybe by talking to them in the Nugitraaiilian language we can get them to stop.”

Lucas nodded. “Let me try it then.”

He uploaded the Nugitraaiilian language to his voice modulators before turning around. “Halt. We do not wish to fight.”

The mechs that had been chasing them suddenly stopped. Lucas stopped as well. Did it work?



<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 138 - Communication</h1>


Hostiles have communicated in native language. Match probability to hostiles lowers to 57.912%. As ordered by the Sh’lteek protocol, any attempts at communication, even from hostile forces, are to be accepted. Halting all hostile actions. Computing best response…

…………………………………………………

Everyone just floated in the air. The tension was palpable. At least, it was for the humans. The mechs were almost certainly immune to it. As everyone waited anxiously, one of the mechs floated forward.

“State your purpose.” The voice was obviously robotic with a metallic tinge to it. The Nugitraaiilian language was made up of hissing and screeching sounds making it incredibly grating to the human ear. Both Chu Shen and the twins cringed at the sound of the voice. Lucas, however, seemed used to it. Most likely because he grew up around aliens, so he was used to such strange voices.

Lucas decided he needed to answer them. “We came here to explore. We did not know this place was inhabited.”

“This place is not inhabited by intelligent life.” Came the robotic voice. Lucas blinked. What did it mean by not inhabited? If it wasn’t, then why would the robots be here?

“Why did you attack us?” Lucas decided to cut to the chase.

“Your match probability to the invaders from 12.3 cycles ago reached over fifty percent. According to the Sh’lteek protocol, I was ordered to regard you as hostiles.”

The voice said 12.3 cycles but Lucas’ translation program immediately translated that into human years. 412 years. That was the number Lucas received. Of course, such a number was meaningless, since the timeflow from dimension to dimension could vary.

The voice continued talking while Lucas was trying to process this. “Why did you send a Tachyon transmission? How did you arrive here? How do you know our language? Answer these queries or face immediate termination.”

Lucas turned to Chu Shen and switched his voice modulator. “Uh buddy. I just got asked some questions I’m gonna need your help on.”

Chu Shen nodded. “Go ahead. I can’t understand a word you guys are saying anyways.”

Lucas immediately explained the questions to him. Afterwards he looked at Chu Shen with an expectant face. “So? What do we do?”

Chu Shen sighed. “Tell them this. ‘We arrived here from a different dimension. The Tachyonic transmission was to determine if this was the same dimension as the one we originated from. The language was learned from a species identical to this one located in our original universe.’ Honestly, I don’t like revealing all this, but I can’t come up with a convincing lie that won’t get us killed on a moment’s notice.”


Lucas nodded understandingly. “I get it Chu Shen. No one thinks you could do better.”

Of course, there was someone that disagreed. ‘I think you could, brat.’

‘Shut up Master Ti Wu. You’re ruining  a touching moment here.’ 

‘Did you just tell me to shut up?! You brat!’ While Master Ti Wu scolded Chu Shen, Lucas conveyed the message to the mech in its language.

There was a delay as the robot seemed to process the new information. After half-a-minute, the mech finally answered. “How can this information be verified?”

Lucas smiled. “Quite easily. All I need to do is transmit to you the data from my memory banks. You may have noticed since you destroyed one of my bodies earlier, but I am not an organic. I am a cyborg, part organic and part machine. I have a positronic brain modeled after my organic brain, implanted after an accident caused severe damage to my body.”

“Transmit the data immediately.”


“How?”

“If you transmit it on Radio Frequency 52.92, Assault Mech 009 will be able to pick up the signal.”

“Transmitting now.” Lucas started transferring a video feed of what he had seen since they had arrived at this new dimension, while also providing translating software. It took only one minute to transfer the data and another three minutes for the voice to process it.

Finally, the voice spoke. “Your claims have been verified. You are now classified as non-hostile aliens. You will no longer be attacked by any of the Mechanized Armor Units or by any Orbital Installations. Due to your new classification, I am required to inform you that the alien invaders from 12.3 cycles ago have now appeared inside the planetary system. Due to this conflict, this planet will no longer be safe. Use this information wisely, because the Defense System will not assign priority to your protection. If this unit survives the war, I may have further questions for you about this identical species.”

Lucas nodded his thanks. “Thank you for your concern. I will discuss our options with my companions before making any decisions. I don’t believe we will be here for the war but if we are then we will answer any questions you may have.”


He turned to Chu Shen. “Well, it appears we are in the clear. The A.I., or whatever that thing is, has agreed to let us stay here in peace. There’s a catch though. Apparently those invaders are back.”

Aslo spoke up. “You said that they appeared over four hundred years ago. Why would they appear now?”

Lucas shrugged. “No idea. They must want this planet for something, though. Four hundred years is enough for most radiation to dissipate.”

Aslo was, of course, confused by this answer. However, he did remember one thing though. “Does this mean those invaders are coming to wipe out the Nugitraaiil again?”

Lucas shook his head. “No. I asked the mech and it said this planet was uninhabited. Those invaders already finished the job. Honestly, I don’t see why we don’t just go back to your dimension. There’s a war about to start and we don’t have a piece in either side.”

Aslo shook his head. “No. This planet is the burial place of all those people. I wouldn’t have wanted the Asura Sect to use the Rising Tide Sect’s old buildings. That is exactly what those invaders want to do here. I want to stay and help them fight.”

Chrissa spoke up softly. “I want to as well.”

Lucas threw up his hands. “Great. Just great!” He turned towards Chu Shen. “Tell them we need to leave. We could quite easily lose our lives here. I’d prefer it if we just left right now.”

Aslo also turned to Chu Shen. “Savior, I know that this request is unreasonable. I just want to defend the memory of all these people. I feel a connection with them. You don’t need to stay, just allow me and Chrissa to.”

Chu Shen lowered his head and began to think. 


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 139 - Decisions</h1>

Chu Shen had to look at things rationally. The Nugitraaiil had already lost this fight once. It had been over four hundred years, enough time for new technologies to develop on both sides. However, with the Nugitraaiil already wiped out, it was questionable if technological research had continued.

Also, their power was limited. The real conflict would happen in space. Up there, Chu Shen and his friends wouldn’t have the ability to influence the conflict. Of course, Lucas could make them spacecraft to get involved, but they would have to train in order to learn how to use them. Without that training, it would be more like suicide then helping.

Even if that happened, it still wouldn’t matter. Their impact on the invasion would be negligible in the end. It was a different situation than before, when he fought the bugs. They used ground troops to conduct war and had no space forces. These invaders had only used space forces so far. Not to mention, this wasn’t their fight. There was absolutely no logical reason for them to risk their lives in order to fight these invaders. 

Chu Shen sighed. Of course, logic was exactly that. Logic. They weren’t computers that operated solely on the outcome. They had emotions, and often times those emotions would override logic.

Chu Shen looked up suddenly. Lucas and Aslo waited impatiently for his decision. “Lucas. We’re staying.” 

Lucas’ jaw dropped. “What do you mean we’re staying! We can’t stay! The chances of our survival if we do are basically none!”

Chu Shen sighed. “I know that. I can’t abandon my friends though. Aslo and Chrissa are going to be staying here even if we don’t want them to. Plus, I agree with Aslo and Chrissa. We should protect the resting place of the Nugitraaiil and not let it be used by those that killed them.”

Lucas threw up his hands. “I give up. We’re all going to die trying to protect something that an entire species was already wiped out for.”

“That’s what makes it worthwhile,” argued Aslo.

Chu Shen turned to Lucas. “Can you tell the mech that we want to help them?”

Lucas sighed and nodded. “Yeah. I can do that.” The mechs hadn’t flown off. Instead, all of them landed on the ground and seemed to go into sleep mode. They had one knee on the ground and seemed to be bowing to something. The one that had been cut in half, on the other hand, had flown off somewhere else. 

He landed next to the one he had been talking to. Going over to it, he tapped it on its leg. A metallic thud could be heard when he did so. The robot stiffened before standing up smoothly. Its head swiveled completely around, probably as part of the boot up service. 

Then it turned and looked right at Lucas. “What is it, civilian?” its metallic voice once again sounded out.

Lucas stared right back at the robot. “I have discussed it with my companions as promised. They have decided to not allow the invaders to desecrate the Nugitraaiil burial grounds. The last memories of a species is not to be sullied like this.”

The robot stared at him for a few seconds before replying. “There is an error in your statement. These are not the last memories of the Nugitraaiilian race. While it is true that 99.998% of the population was wiped out by war and the solar flare, 0.002% was saved. They were sent through an experimental interdimensional transportation technology, accidentally discovered in the search for FTL capability. As for their safety after entering the interdimensional event, that is unknown.”

Lucas clenched his fist. “Yes! I knew I was right! It was too much of a coincidence.” Turning back to the robot he nodded. “I am sorry for the assumption. You previously stated that the planet was uninhabited so we assumed they were wiped out by the solar flare. Moving on, how will our request to work with you to defeat the invaders be accepted?”

The robot paused. “It will not be accepted. Civilians cannot become involved in military affairs. You can be recruited as privateers if you wish. According to agreements from the previous war, privateers will be paid in Cores. 12 F’tik Rank Cores for every fighter destroyed, 6 G’tik Rank Cores for every destroyer or cruiser destroyed, 4 H’tik Rank Cores for every battleship or carrier destroyed, and 1 J’tik Rank Core for every Dreadnought destroyed.”

Lucas scratched his head. Alright, these cores sounded like money to him, but what were they exactly? “Can you tell me what these cores are in more detail?”

“Cores are the source of energy contained inside beasts. By absorbing such energy, one can advance their Tik level.”

Lucas nodded as he listened before freezing. “Is this Tik refer to the ability to manipulate energy around oneself and become stronger? One can unblock channels inside their body to absorb and control more energy. Is that what you mean by Tik?”

“Affirmative, civilian.”

“Were there some of you that could fight without the usage of spaceships? Using only their bodies?”

“Affirmative, civilian. Only two hundred L’tik fought in the war, but they managed to turn the tide many times.”

Lucas turned away slowly. “Okay. That is slightly freaky.” He sat down on the ground for a minute. “So every world we’ve visited so far has cultivation in it. Okay. I can accept that.” He realized something. “Wait. Doesn't that make my world stunted? It’s something that’s so basic everywhere else, but we don’t even have the concept of it.”

Chu Shen, who had heard everything, came down next to Lucas. “Don’t feel bad though. Even with cultivation, we can only go so far. With technology, anyone can instantly soar to immense heights.”

Lucas nodded. “That’s true. Technology is the way of an empire. Cultivation is the way of a man. One can only go so far cultivating before they can’t take another step. Technology only requires one to make something new. It has no true limits.”

Chu Shen patted him on the back. “Atta boy. Now what got you all depressed? I heard you say every world so far has cultivation in it. We haven’t seen evidence of cultivation here though.”

Lucas pointed at the robot. “It said they would reward us with beast cores for every ship we destroyed. Basically, we can be hired as privateers or mercenaries in the war. This way we can participate.”

Chu Shen smiled. “Alright. Go ahead and tell him that we will join then.”

“Come on Lucas! Hurry up! I want to kick some invader butt instead of talking about all these weird things.” Aslo yelled at Lucas as well.

Lucas nodded. He turned to the robot. “We will agree to becoming privateers in this war.”

“Your applications to become privateers have been accepted. All rules and regulations according to the K’Lish Protocol will be followed, or your license as a privateer will be revoked.”


“Uhh. What are the rules?”

“The rules and regulations will be broadcast on Radio Frequency 52.92 in 37 seconds. Civilian, please be prepared to receive the information.”

Lucas nodded. Turning to Chu Shen he sighed. “I have to face my dreaded enemy once again.”

Chu Shen was confused. “Enemy? Who?”

“Paperwork.”

As both Chu Shen and Lucas groaned, Aslo smiled. “Alright! So where can we find this dreadful paperwork? We need to destroy him once and for all!”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 140 - Invasion Begins</h1>

It turns out, the Nugitraaiil were not that big on paperwork, much to the relief of Lucas and Chu Shen. There were some small things, but there were only three major points. 

One. Any commands that are given by the military is to be followed. Two. They were allowed to engage the invaders, but they must first register their attack plans. Three. There was to be no attempt to fake invader kill count. If that was done, then all previous cores must be refunded and your privateer license would be revoked forever.

Everything else was just small tidbits, like how to register attack plans or that the military could do random inspections of any ship records. They weren’t really concerned with that since at the moment the only ship they had was the small one Lucas owned. It wasn’t meant for fighting.

Chu Shen approached him about that. “Lucas. We need a way to get involved in this fight. The best way to do that is with a spaceship. Can you make one quickly enough to suit our needs?”


Lucas sighed. “Yeah but what good is one spaceship going to do? I would rather make a whole fleet of drones to fight instead of one spaceship.” Lucas’ face lit up. “That’s it! So long as I make a ton more of those cradle free fabricators, I can start making tons of ships in a short amount of time. All I would need would be materials.” 

He grimaced. “The materials though… The ARD (Atomic Reassembling Device) will be really helpful in that regard, but making a ton of metal would require a lot of time. Plus, it can only make one type of material at once. Hmm.”

Chu Shen shrugged. “I don’t see why you don’t just make more ARD’s then. With more you can increase production of metals by a lot.”

Lucas waved his hand dismissively. “Because I only have enough room inside my space for two more of them. The Anti-Matter generator could easily power ten more but I just don’t have the space.”

Chu Shen tapped him on the shoulder. “Uh Lucas. Why are you making them inside your space?”

Lucas rolled his eyes. “Because, we can’t have people finding out about technology. You said it yourself. If someone found out, then one of those insanely powerful people could come and kill all of us.”

Chu Shen nodded. “That is true... but look around. I don’t see that issue coming up here.”

Lucas looked at the mechs around him and then back at Chu Shen. “Oh yeah. Alright, give me ten days and I should have it done. Ten more days after that, I should be cranking out spaceships.”

……………………………

While Lucas was busy making the spaceships a reality, there was a war going on. The A.I. had activated all of its resources to hunt down the invaders. Its orbital defenses activated stealth, preventing the scouts from noticing it.

The invaders’ scout force consisted of three cruisers. The three ships went to each planet and did a thorough scan. When they reached the planet Chu Shen was on, the defense platforms activated. Over fifty of the round defense platforms shot beams of white hot plasma, at least fifteen for each ship. Compared to the one fired at Lucas’ satellite, these were over twenty times more powerful.

The cruisers’ shields flared for only a second before disappearing under the barrage of enemy fire. They didn’t even have a chance to react. The three cruisers were filled with holes, making them resemble swiss cheese. Two of them blew up as their reactors lost containment. The other ended up breaking into five pieces. Plasma beams continued firing until all the pieces of the alien ships were erased.

A week after the cruisers were destroyed, five destroyers appeared in the system. Compared to the cruisers, the destroyers had superior shields and weaponry by a large margin. They were also slower. They were obviously sent to investigate the disappearance of the cruisers.

One of the destroyers was left next to the seventh planet while the other four spread out to investigate the rest of the system. Apparently, they were worried about not getting a message this time. The defenses activated once again, blasting the two destroyers who were close to the planet to bits. At the same time, an ion cannon located on the seventh planet was able to destroy the destroyer that was located next to it.

The other two tried to flee, but they were swarmed by over one hundred fighters that were in the asteroid belt between the sixth and seventh planets. Their debris was annihilated just like before. All of this was done to try and slow down the invasion. With this, preparations could continue for as long as possible.

The A.I. in charge of the fleet knew a lot about naval strategies. The next attempt at scouting would most likely be an entire fleet. If so, it was pretty much guaranteed that at least one ship would get away. When that happened, multiple fleets would all converge on them.

Just like four hundred years ago, they would send only a couple fleets. Each defeat would mean an increase of one fleet to the fight. Eventually it would reach the point where the defenders would be overwhelmed by sheer numbers. It would be at this point that privateers would be needed. At the moment the A.I. had already commanded the only privateers to stay planetside. It did not seem as though they were capable of spaceflight at the moment anyways.

Just like the A.I. had predicted, a week later a fleet consisting of 1 carrier, 200 fighters, 10 battleships, 40 destroyers, and 20 cruisers arrived at the seventh planet. The carrier launched ten wings of fighters with five fighters to a wing for a total of fifty fighters launched. 

The fighters scattered throughout the system, doing long range reconnaissance while the rest of the fleet slowly moved into the planetary system. The A.I. had small naval bases set up everywhere inside the system. Hollowed out asteroids in the asteroid belt contained either one large ship, five medium ships, or one hundred fighters.  Naval bases on the planets contained surface-to-orbit capable weapons along with large amounts of spacecraft.

The A.I. had not wasted time developing its defenses. The ships at the bases were mostly outdated though. Its research, which was conducted on the fourth planet inside the system, had allowed it to progress steadily. The seventh planet contained the oldest ships. The closer you get to the sun, the newer the ships became. The reason for this was that the ship production lines were on the first planet next to the sun.

The reason it was set up there was because it offered abundant energy and natural cloaking. The sun’s radiation was able to interfere with pretty much all scanning attempts. The production line was located deep underground though, to avoid all that radiation, and was heavily shielded. Any ships were launched when the installation was facing away from the sun to avoid damage from the sun’s intense radiation.

As soon as the enemy fleet went past the asteroid belt, numerous ships launched. Taking the enemy by surprise, over half of their destroyers and cruisers were immediately destroyed. The battleships were much tougher nuts. All of the battleships took off for the seventh planet as it was clear the fleet did not have a chance of surviving. All of the other ships tried to hold off the enemies to allow the battleships to escape. The fighters from the carrier proved to be particularly annoying.

They were successful.

One battleship, with over five holes in its hull, managed to limp to the seventh planet and jump.

The A.I. was not disappointed at this failure. It had no feelings after all. Instead it calmly ordered the surviving ships back to their hiding places. There, they would be repaired for the next fight.

After all, the war had only just begun.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 141 - Fleet!</h1>

It had been fourteen days since Lucas had started construction. First, he had brought out the cradle-free fabricator. Then he took out the ARD and the anti-matter generator. Next, he hooked up the power cables for the fabricator and ARD to the anti-matter generator. After that, it was time to start on the construction part.

First, Lucas ordered Chu Shen, Aslo, and Chrissa to gather together a bunch of rock and dirt. Pouring that into the ARD, Lucas gained the raw materials he needed to create more ARDs. Activating the fabricator, an ARD started to come to life. A day later it was complete. Hooking up this ARD to the generator, Lucas started building another fabricator identical to the one he had but much bigger.

This one was easily the size of a building. It was actually ten different fabricators synchronized together to construct one item. Each fabricator would focus on building one piece of the ship at a time, accomplishing what the original fabricator could do in a fraction of the time. It could also make multiple ships at once if the ships were small enough.

The ship types that could be built with this one were expanded, allowing it to make battleships, carriers, and destroyers.  The original fabricator could only make cruisers and fighters. destroyers were too big, unless the fabricator was able to move around the frame. Using the fabricators, Lucas started making more ARDs. After he had created a total of eight, he went back to the fabricators.

He made one Mega-Fabricator which could make dreadnoughts. Then he made a total of sixteen Large-Fabricators and ten fabricators the size of the original one. Finally, Lucas was done preparing for the building phase. By now, all of his devices took up as much space as a small town. The time taken up by making the fabricators and ARDs was ten days. The other four days had been spent calibrating the equipment. 

Pulling up ship designs, Lucas started to ponder over what to build. Using the combat records from the recent attack provided by the A.I., Lucas was able to find out just how advanced the invaders were. Compared to the ships of Sparta, they were indeed extremely crude. 

He took a while before deciding exactly what he was going to build. He also consulted with Chu Shen for a while as well. Within an hour of getting it done, Lucas had decided what direction he was going to take his fleet.

First off, the main force he was going to be using would not be the large capital ships but rather small fighters. They were easier to build and a lot faster, too.

Lucas had designs for advanced fighter-craft like the sniper drone. It was a small fighter that used a Tachyon cannon. Tachyons were particles that moved faster than light. Normally, they could not interact with things in the physical universe, but with some tinkering, Sparta had found a way to do so. Because it moved instantaneously, it was only limited to line of sight.

Lucas also had designs for a shield drone. It was a fighter that would be able to link up its forcefields. By synchronizing them together, the strength of them would increase over tenfold. Combining these two together would make for a lethal combination. They could pick off the entire fleet of ships from a distance while shielding themselves from return fire.

His battleships would have thick armor and powerful shields. They would also be equipped with railguns and plasma turrets. Their plasma turrets had the capability to manipulate the projectiles even after they launched them, though only in a short area. Lucas predicted the railguns would throw them for a loop.


The enemy ships had forcefields, but from Lucas’ analysis of the records, he found that they were not designed for blocking kinetic attacks. Most of their ships used lasers and plasma, both of which were energy weapons. As a result, their defensive capabilities focused mostly on energy weapons and ignored kinetic weapons such as railguns.

The carriers Lucas designed to be lightly armored. Instead of being heavily plated, they would have cloaking devices to disguise themselves as asteroids, allowing them to avoid most of the fight. The carriers would store metal and miniature fabricators, allowing them to repair the fighters as soon as they flew in. 

Finally, there was the destroyers. They would have multiple plasma turrets meant for destroying fighters and missiles. Their main job would be to protect the battleships from being destroyed. 

The destroyers would also have one enormous plasma gun running the entire length of the ship, allowing them to live up to their name. They would be able to use this enormous weapon for long range artillery strikes, but it would be too draining to use this and defend the battleships.

Everything he designed would run off H20 Reactors, meaning they only required water to run. However, there was was one slight issue. There was no one to pilot all of the ships. Of course, nothing he made actually had room for a pilot either. Instead, they all had room for a positronic brain, onto which Lucas would upload a primitive A.I.. The A.I. would be pre-programmed with combat maneuvers so as to allow them combat capability.

All of the ships would have QE comms, allowing for instantaneous communication without the possibility of being intercepted. With that, the drones would be able to receive instructions no matter where they were. 

In order to save on space and power, Lucas only installed short range teleportation modules. It would allow the ships to jump from the fifth planet to the sixth planet in two seconds flat, allowing for some very interesting tactical options. They wouldn’t be able to chase the enemy fleet though.

Now that Lucas had the designs down, it was time for him to start building. Dedicating the Mega-Fabricator to carriers, he would be able to make two at once. Three of the Large-Fabricators were dedicated to battleships, but they could only make one at a time. Three more Large-Fabricators were assigned to destroyers and could make three at once. 

The other ten Large-Fabricators started work on fighters. Each one would make 4 Sniper Drones and 2 Shield drones. The original-size fabricators, all three of them, would be busy making regular fighters. These fighters would have plasma bombs, small-caliber railguns, and lasers. They would mostly be in charge of hunting down other fighter craft. 

Lucas had made it to the point where every single one of the fabricators would get done with their assignment in eight hours. With this, a formidable fleet would start to take shape. At the end of the fourteenth day, the construction of the spaceships finally started to get underway. As Lucas was filled with pride at his handiwork, two other people were starting to get mad.

Aslo slumped down on the ground, wiping the sweat from his brow as he did so. A huge pile of dirt lay behind him, next to the feet of one of the hibernating mechs and one of the ARDs. Chu Shen, who had just starting to breathe heavily, patted him on the back. “Come one Aslo, we still have more dirt to haul.”

Aslo shook his head. “Nope. Not going to do it. Honestly, why are we doing this? It’s just dirt.”

Chu Shen shook his head. “Because Lucas needs it to make spaceships to fight.”

“Then how about Lucas comes down here and moves it himself,” Aslo complained. He remembered telling Lucas that, and Lucas’ reply. “I wanted to leave. You guys want to help these aliens? Then you move the dirt. Of course, you don’t have to help, Chrissa. Just stay here so I don’t get bored, okay?”

Aslo gestured towards the dirt behind him. It was enough to fill a house with. “This is too much for us to do, and it’s just going to get worse.” He got up and groaned.  Walking up next to one of the mechs he kicked it in the leg. “Come on, you stupid tin can. Get up and help us. We’re going to fight for you, so the least you could do is move some dirt.

Suddenly, one of the mechs that had lain in rest woke up. Reaching down, it grabbed the entire pile of dirt. The voice emerged from the robot, completely understandable due to the translation program that Lucas had given it. “I will assist you, privateer, in your war efforts. Tell me where you wish to move this dirt to.”

When Aslo recovered from his shock, he let out a big smile. “Hehe. I guess Lucas is going to get the surprise of his life.”

…………………………………………..

Lucas had, at first, been angry about the mechs helping them move the dirt. That was, until he realized something. The amount of dirt he had asked for them to move was only the amount needed for one ARD. 

Now that there were ten ARDs, the amount of dirt needed would increase by a lot. Aslo and Chu Shen were running themselves ragged keeping up with just one ARD, much less ten of them. It would be better if the mechs took over that job for them. They were far more efficient then Aslo and Chu Shen could ever be. Especially since they were robots and didn’t need to take a break.

Chu Shen was busy training, using the abundant radiation left over from the solar flare. Aslo and Chrissa were busy talking to each other. Lucas was keeping an eye on the machinery while playing solitaire mentally. The three mechs were busy walking back and forth between the ARDs and the huge pit they had dug out using their four arms.

The mech that was busy loading the ARDs with dirt paused. Dumping the unloaded dirt on the ground, it walked over to Lucas. Lucas didn’t notice the mech, absorbed as he was with his card game. That is, until it started speaking.

“Privateer. I have an issue with the spaceships you are building.” The sudden voice so close to him caused Lucas to jump up. Realizing what a fool he made of himself, Lucas immediately tried to act casual. Unfortunately, Aslo had seen him.

“What is it Lucas? Afraid of a voice?” Aslo teased him a bit.

“Oh shut up Aslo!” Lucas yelled at him. Then he turned back to the mech. “You mentioned a problem you had with the spaceships. What is the problem exactly?”

“I cannot classify the spaceships you have. The weapons are unknown. Until the weapons’ exact nature has been determined, all attempts at assimilating them into pre-existing strategies are pointless.”

Lucas grinned. “Of course they’re unknown. I brought the plans from another dimension, so it would be weird if you actually knew what they were.”

“According to the contract you previously signed, you cannot refuse a military order without having your privateer license revoked. In accordance with this agreement, I order you to demonstrate your spaceships’ capabilities.”

Lucas grinned. “Alright then.” He turned towards everyone. “Hey guys! Tin man over here wants us to demonstrate the fleet’s weaponry. How about we show it to him!”

Immediately, there was a cheer from Chu Shen and Aslo. Chrissa just nodded. “Alright! I was getting bored trying to talk with Chrissa.” Aslo smiled at Chrissa as he said this, communicating his intent wasn’t to hurt her.

Lucas made his spaceship appear in front of them. Just like before, it was a huge silver ship that looked like a teardrop. The mech turned to look towards it before looking back at Lucas. “This spaceship will also be included in the demonstration.”

Lucas nodded. “Alright then. I never really got a chance to show off its capabilities, so now is a perfect chance to show off a little bit.” He turned to his companions. “Alright gang, everyone on the spaceship!”

Aslo walked up to the ship and poked it. “How are we supposed to get into this thing anyways.”

Chu Shen grinned. “Here, all you have to is walk through it. It gives way easily, just like this.” As he said that he walked up to the ship. Confident in the nanites that made up the ship, he walked right into it. What did not happen, however, was the wall dissolving. Instead Chu Shen hit it face first and fell backwards.

As Chu Shen laid on the ground stunned, Lucas’ face was nearly split in half by his grin. “Whoops. I may have forgotten to activate the nanite walls. Just maybe.”

Chu Shen immediately shot to his feet. “Lucas! I thought we talked about pulling pranks!”

Lucas held up his hands. “Hey! It’s not my fault you decided to be cool by walking into the ship without warning.”

Chu Shen coughed. He quickly changed the subject to avoid embarrassment. “A-anyways, we need to get moving.”


Aslo grinned. “Yeah. I remember you saying that the ships could blow up stuff! Come on, I wanna see!”

Lucas grinned and approached the ship’s side. “This is what Mr. Cool Guy over there was trying to show you.” As he spoke, his hand sunk into the ship. Walking forward, he became completely enveloped by the ship and disappeared. Chu Shen followed sulkily while Aslo and Chrissa held hands and went through. 

They all found themselves standing on a metal walkway. What they also found was an unexpected guest.

“Privateers.” A robot voice came from right beside Lucas.

Lucas jumped and quickly looked around. Standing beside him was one of the drone scouts. “Ahem. Uh, what are you doing on my ship?”

Chu Shen grinned. “The bigger question is how you can jump that high.”

The adult-sized robot ignored Chu Shen’s remarks. “I am here to observe directly from your ship’s bridge. This is to verify that you have used all weapons available to you.”

Lucas rolled his eyes. “Fine. Come with me then, all of you.” They walked down the hallways for a while. Soon they reached a round room. Had a huge screen with a view of the outside. There was nothing else in the room. Suddenly the floor flowed upwards, creating five circular chairs.

Sitting down on the chair in the middle, Lucas patted the one next to him. “Everybody take a seat, robot included. Next stop is the asteroid belt so we can blow up some asteroids.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 143 - Testing</h1>

Lucas piloted the ship mentally. With him around, there was no need for inefficient things like physical interfaces. As the ship lifted out of the atmosphere, one ship of each type that he had made so far also lifted off. They had plenty of fuel for their reactors thanks to the ARDs.

After an hour, they had reached the asteroid belt. It had taken them that long to get into range of the asteroid belt so they could jump straight to it. Aslo, who had been bored out of his mind, finally sat up straight in his chair. “Are we there yet? It’s been ages.”

Lucas sighed. “Oh come on. At first you were so excited since you got to see planets floating in space. Remember that? You were all like, ‘How can something so big float?’ and ‘What does hyperspace look like?’ Then the rest of the time you complained about how boring it was.”

“Well, because it’s true. It really is boring around here.” Aslo tried defending himself.

“Ugh. If it wasn’t for the range on the new ships I would have jumped straight here.” Lucas grumbled under his breath. “Now that we are here,” Lucas said in a louder voice. “I believe it’s time to start showcasing the weapons.”

The drone scout spoke up, interrupting Lucas. “This asteroid belt is currently being used as a military base of operations. Only certain sections of the belt is not developed for  military use and can be used for target practice.”

Lucas facepalmed. “Why were we not notified of this when we departed?”

“The information was not relevant at the time.”

“Alright then, robot, where can I do this demonstration for you?” Lucas asked, obviously irritated by now. Everyone else was stifling their laughter at Lucas’ annoyance.

The robot, oblivious to his irritation, replied in its monotone voice. “Seven cruisers are currently launching from nearby asteroid installations. They will fire on several asteroids on the outskirt of the belt that can be used for the demonstration. They will also be taking scans of the demonstration as well to gather the information needed. If there are any more targets needed, the fighters will point out more of them.”

Lucas sighed and nodded his agreement. Focusing on the scans from his ship, soon he spotted the seven cruisers. A low power laser shot out of each cruiser, highlighting seven asteroids that could be used for target practice.

Lucas immediately marked the asteroids on the viewscreen, making them appear red. “First I’m going to be showing you the capabilities of this ship, so long as no other objections are raised.” Everyone glared the robot but it just sat there, once again oblivious to human emotion.

Lucas went back to his presentation. “I am  launching a stealth missile from the ship we are currently on. Launching in three... two... one... fire.” On the screen a translucent shape appeared from over the top of the ship. It reached one of the marked asteroids in three seconds. Immediately, a large explosion blasted the entire asteroid to bits. The half the missile impacted was vaporized, while the other half was turned into pieces no bigger than a man’s fist.

The mech spoke up first. “The missile was not spotted on any of the cruisers’ sensors.”

Lucas rolled his eyes. “Of course. If it could be spotted then it wouldn’t need to be called a ‘stealth missile’ now, would it? Anyways, this ship is the only one with missiles in the entire fleet. Missiles are just too much trouble to make in large amounts, plus they are a one time use. Moving on, we will show you the ships of the real fleet. First is the destroyer. It has one massive plasma gun and multiple plasma turrets. It’s meant for long-range artillery and protecting the other, larger, ships from fighters.”

As Lucas spoke, the destroyer that had followed them sped up. The destroyer was shaped like an arrowhead with the tip of the arrow being sheared off.

It got within a mile of one of the asteroids meant for target practice. White plasma bolts lit up the asteroid, thousands of them per second, peppering it with millions of holes. Every single plasma bolt struck the asteroid, some of them curving through the air.

Once the destroyer flew a mile and a half from the asteroid, the plasma bolts became far less accurate. At three miles, the plasma bolts were now dissipating too much, no longer having a visible impact on the asteroid. The destroyer flew twenty miles away from the asteroid before turning around to face the asteroid head on. 

The blunt tip pointing towards the front started glowing a menacing white. A white streak shot forward, a blur in the eyes of man. It hit the asteroid and went through it. The plasma bolt didn’t even seem affected by the obstacle and continued on for over two thousand miles before it dissipated.

“Next up is the carrier. It has similar plasma turrets to the destroyer with no special armament. It’s really just meant to refuel and repair fighters. It can also cloak itself.” As Lucas spoke, the huge sphere-shaped carrier suddenly turned into several medium sized asteroids.

“Then we have the battleships. These have multiple railguns meant for close range and long range. It also has some plasma turrets, but nothing like the destroyers do.” The battleship floated forward while a fairly good sized turret on its top side swiveled. It too was shaped like an arrowhead, but it did not have a blunt tip.

It appeared like nothing had happened before one of the asteroids seemed to explode. Fragments of rock spun everywhere. “The battleship has thirty railgun turrets with at least eight of them able to cover each of its sides. The railguns can fire up to a thousand projectiles per minute, each with the same amount of force as this one.”

“Next we have the shield fighters.” This was the only craft Lucas brought more of. He had brought a total of five of them but it made sense when you think about it. It was only in groups that such fighters could make a difference. “These fighters can link shields together, creating a shield wall that is exponentially more powerful than the shields on our battleships. For example.”

The fighters all linked together, creating an enormous white wall. Without warning the destroyer swiveled towards the fighters, launching an enormous plasma bolt at the fighters. The white wall was hit by the plasma and dimmed slightly but stayed up.

“Finally, we have the sniper fighters. These fighters are equipped with a Tachyon cannon that can fire from one end of the solar system to the other.” The fighter flew in front of the ships before turning to the asteroid. This one was in the shape of a tube and was not as agile as the other fighter had been.

A hole mysteriously appeared in the asteroid it was pointing to. The fighter swiveled back around and pointed to an asteroid one thousand miles away. Just like before, a hole appeared in the asteroid. Lucas grinned back at them. “As you can see, no matter the distance, the hit is instantaneous and fatal.”





<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 144 - Whoops</h1>

While Lucas was grinning like a maniac, fighters started to emerge from the asteroid he blew up with the Tachyon cannon. The drone scout turned towards Lucas. “You have targeted an asteroid not highlighted for target usage. The asteroid you targeted was a fighter base to be used in our defense. Due to violation of your previous orders to only use designated targets, your privateer status is revoked.””

Lucas immediately panicked. “What?! You mean, because I blew up the wrong space rock I can’t fight anymore?! What kind of logic is that?”

The robot replied uncaringly with its robotic voice. “Such logic is dictated by military law. Destruction of 7 fighters and damage to the fighter base comes to a total of 7 G’Tik Cores. Because Privateer has not demonstrated he possesses this amount of money, the secondary punishment of immediate expulsion from any militaristic organizations and permanent banning from any and all future attempts at joining such organizations again has been enacted.”

It took him a few seconds to translate all that legal gobbledygook into something understandable. Essentially, he would have been fined for the damages he caused. Unfortunately, the computer thought he didn’t have the money. As a result, he was going to be kicked out of the privateers and never be allowed to join again.

This stunned Lucas, causing him to slump into his seat. He had no idea what to say in response. Luckily, Chu Shen came to his rescue. “It is true that we do not have the amount requested to pay for the damages. However, can we instead trade things of equal value?”

The scout drone paused, communicating with the AI, before responding. “Such a request does have merit. A previous case was settled like this once before. What would you like to trade, privateer?”

Chu Shen pointed at the viewscreen. “I would like to trade a destroyer and carrier. Would this be possible?”

“The estimated value of these unique designs is 12 G’Tik cores or 1 H’Tik core and 2 G’Tik cores. Would you like to trade these items and receive 5 G’Tik cores in return?”

Chu Shen nodded. “Yes. Would you reinstate Lucas’ privateer license?”

“Lucas’ privateer license will be reinstated once control circuits necessary for me to control them remotely have been installed.”

Chu Shen turned to Lucas. “You heard him Lucas. Can the AI control them remotely right now?”

Lucas, who had been eagerly paying attention to the conversation, immediately gave his response. “I believe so. I designed it to be controlled remotely, although the controls are routed through the QE comms rather than the conventional radio. I would have to do some tinkering so that it is compatible with the AI’s systems, but it shouldn’t take more than a day or two.”

The scout drone voiced its agreement. “Such a delay is satisfactory.”

Aslo punched Lucas in the arm. “Seriously? You just had to blow up the wrong thing.”

Lucas punched him back. “Oh, like you could’ve done better? You would have blown up the entire asteroid belt before we could stop you.”

Aslo shrugged. “What can I say? I like a good explosion. Must come with being a fire mage.”

Chrissa shook her head at the boys arguing. They did it so often one would think she would be used to it by now. Chu Shen, on the other hand, wasn’t as passive. He groaned before grabbing Lucas around the shoulder. Hauling Lucas around, he forced Lucas to face the viewscreen. “Come on Lucas. We still have a lot of work to do.”

Lucas threw up his hands. “Fine. I guess we do still need to modify the ships anyway.” The ship disappeared into hyperspace, reappearing above the fifth planet less than four seconds later.

The drone scout spotted the planet and immediately received confirmation from its own telemetry systems. “Privateers, if this ship had the capability to move between this planet and the asteroid belt, why did it not do so before now?”

Lucas was the one that answered. “The reason is that while this ship can move such distances, the other ships in our fleet cannot. Over half of the space on the ship we are currently on is dedicated to hyperspace drives. The other ships’ hyperspace drives have limited ranges. We kept pace with them since we were doing a demonstration of their capabilities. Now that the demonstration is over, they can head back to the planet on their own; we don’t have to keep pace with them anymore.”

The drone scout immediately asked another question. “Why did you give the ships in your fleet limited hyperspace drives? It would seem that having more capable drives would allow for a strategic advantage.”

Lucas nodded. “While that is true, there are other factors to consider. Hyperspace drives require a lot of power to use. The hyperspace drives the ships are using are the best they can use for the power source they have. Right now, all of them have fusion bottles. They don’t have as much power as an anti-matter or fusion generator, but they also doesn’t require as much time to make. 

In order to make a ship with an improved power source and hyperspace drive, it would require ten times as long to make, and the attack power of the ship would not see a significant increase. It would be better to pump out more ships with inferior drives then to cut our production speed by that much.”

The scout drone sounded its affirmative. “Such logic is unquestionable. Continue with your current production specifications then, former-privateer Lucas.”

Lucas winced at the robot’s last statement. Aslo chuckled. “Hehe. Who knew a robot could have such dry humor?”

Lucas turned to Aslo. “Shut up, Aslo.”


That did it. Aslo and Chu Shen started laughing so hard that Aslo fell out of his seat. Even Chrissa smiled a bit. Lucas activated his and Chrissa’s harnesses before lowering the inertia dampeners. Activating the engines at full throttle, Lucas flew into the atmosphere of the planet.

Chu Shen and Aslo were thrown backwards from the sudden acceleration. While Chu Shen was merely pressed against his seat, Aslo was flattened against the wall spread eagle style. The entire ship started shaking, throwing Aslo and Chu Shen around the cabin.

When they landed, Aslo and Chu Shen stumbled out of the ship, looking like two drunks and feeling very sore. Lucas grinned as he looked at them. “I wonder, who has the last laugh now?”



<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 145 - Time to Shine</h1>

Lucas finished installing the controllers onto the ships that the AI had asked for. Afterwards, he went back to monitoring his devices. Chu Shen received the leftover 5 G’Tik cores. 

Upon receiving them he discovered they were the cores of a Martial Warrior or Rank 5 Beast Cores. To the Martial Army or Rank 6 Chu Shen, they were practically worthless. Nonetheless he absorbed their energy and moved on.

Lucas tallied up the total number of ships he was making every eight hours, and the totals were stunning to see. Every eight hours he would make 3 Battleships, 2 Carriers, 9 Destroyers, 40 Sniper Drones, 20 Shield Drones, and 30 Fighters. 

With this, one could easily see that Lucas was making more than enough machines to keep the enemy at bay. There was still another six days before the enemy came back. With that much time, Lucas would be able to expand his fleet by over a hundred fold. No longer contemplating his genius though, Lucas returned to his work.

……………………………….

Six days later, the enemy fleet appeared. This time it was three fleets. The ship totals was 3 carriers, 600 fighters, 30 battleships, 120 destroyers, and 60 cruisers.

Lucas’ total of ships he had constructed was now at 63 Battleships, 42 Carriers, 189 Destroyers, 840 Sniper Drones, 420 Shield Drones, and 630 Fighters. From this, one could easily surmise that the enemy would easily be crushed by Lucas. Unfortunately, this would not happen. All because of one tiny little detail.

“WHAT!?” Chu Shen winced and rubbed his ears. Lucas’ shout was really too loud, especially when he was right next to him. Lucas pointed at the scout drone. “Repeat that again you pile of junk!”

The scout drone, taking Lucas literally, dutifully reported its news. “Unfortunately, you and your privateers cannot be allowed to participate in the upcoming fight.”

“Why not! We are perfectly capable of helping and more than willing to!” Lucas was becoming more and more irate the longer time went on. First he was kicked out of the privateers, now he couldn’t even fight! Just what was the point in staying on this planet then?

“Logic dictates that you should not participate in the upcoming battles until it is absolutely necessary.”

Lucas scoffed. “Exactly what logic is that?”

“Your ships are equipped with advanced technology so far unseen by the invaders. By not allowing your participation in the fight, your advanced technology will not be revealed. Only when it is absolutely necessary must your ships be used, so as to prevent our technological edge from being revealed. Such logic is dictated by naval strategies currently available to me.”

Lucas opened his mouth to refute the robot’s advice but couldn’t find anything wrong with its information. Eventually he nodded reluctantly. “Alright, we will not participate in any of the future fights to defend this planet until we are allowed to by you.”

“Such actions are acceptable.” The scout drone replied.

……………………………………………….

The enemy fleet moved in towards the system’s sun. Whenever they approached the asteroid belt though, multiple lasers and plasma bolts flew towards various asteroids. Obviously the escaped ship had warned them of the ambushes that awaited them. Belatedly, multiple ships launched from the asteroids, swarming the enemy fleet.

Before, the enemy had been severely outnumbered. With the large increase of ships, they had only outnumbered the enemy fleet 3 to 1 instead of 9 to 1. Obviously the enemy hadn’t been lazy in the four hundred years they had been gone. Instead, they had made significant improvements in their shields and weapons department.

Before, their advantage hadn’t been obvious. Now that their numbers were closer it became clear that the enemy had superior technology than the Nugitraaiil’s old and outdated ships. Soon the enemy had completely wiped out the asteroid belts fleet, but they only had 7 battleships, 19 destroyers, and 92 fighters left. None of the carriers and cruisers had survived the fight.

Continuing with their mission, they moved inward towards the fifth planet. Ships launched from the 9th and 8th planet, over ten times the amount that had been in the asteroid belt. Quickly turning towards the incoming armada, the enemy fleet tried to inflict as much damage as possible before succumbing to their sheer numbers.

The next week the enemy fleet appeared with four fleets instead of the three they had sent last time. This time the attacking fleet didn’t even make it to the asteroid belt. They had barely passed the eighth planet when their fleets attacked.

Once again the enemy was destroyed. This cycle continued, with an additional fleet being added to the enemy’s forces every time they attacked. However, they would soon run out of ships to use in defense. The technological edge the attackers used to have quickly dwindled as the more advanced ships was flown from the inner planets to the outer ones, taking the place of their fallen brethren.

By the the third month Lucas was bored out of his mind. Chu Shen, on the other hand, cultivated wholeheartedly. He soon broke through to become a Martial General Level 7 or Rank 7 Mage. Simultaneously, he also became a Rank 4 warrior, through the enthusiastic efforts of Master Ti Wu.

Chu Shen was able to help Aslo and Chrissa reach Rank 9. They could not, however, progress any further than Rank 9 mages. This was something that could not be handled by just locating a meridian and breaking it down. Instead, they focused on their warrior training. Aslo was able to become a Rank 6 warrior and Chrissa became a Rank 5 warrior.

……………………………………………..

The first day of the third week of the third month, 71 days after the initial alien invasion.

The final ship of the alien invaders was destroyed. By now they were sending in 9 fleets, and the next attack would be 10 fleets. The computer calculated the total ships left in the planetary system. The military ships left would barely be sufficient to destroy them. The orbital defense platforms would also be hard-pressed to defend against such forces.

It was time to activate the privateer force.



<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 146 - Activation</h1>

Chu Shen stepped outside the small hut he had made. He cracked his back, groaning as popping sounds came from his spine. He had spent a month straight inside the small hut cultivating, without moving an inch. He was finally starting to feel hungry again, so he decided to come out and get something to eat.

As he stepped outside, he saw Lucas standing by a large building. The building was huge, as big as one of his spaceships. It was oddly shaped though. Various barrels poked out of it and what appeared to be tracked wheels were attached to its sides. 

The top half of the building rotated suddenly, surprising Chu Shen. A long barrel as wide as his hut was suddenly pointing right at him. Lucas turned and saw Chu Shen standing there in shock. “Oh. Hey Chu Shen! Nice to see you come out of your hut, you hermit!”

Chu Shen shook off his shock and walked closer to Lucas to avoid having to yell. While he walked closer, the barrel swiveled smoothly to follow him. “Nice to see you too Lucas. By the way, what is this thing?” He gestured at the behemoth beside him.

Lucas grinned. “What, this thing?” He smacked the side of the thing beside him. “It’s a Goliath Class Tank. On Sparta, they were what we used to defend our infantry against spaceships. That huge barrel you see there can fire a plasma round through the atmosphere and into space.” 

“It can quite easily blow through any of the shields I have on my ships, much less those aliens’ shields.

They also have shields to defend themselves from enemy attack, along with multiple infinite repeaters on the side, basically plasma rifles with a bigger punch.”

Chu Shen looked at it in confusion. “Just why did you make this thing? I mean, aren’t we going to be defending the planet with spaceships, why build this tank?”

Lucas nodded. “Very good question. The answer, my dear friend, is simple. Where are we going to be during the attack? We can pilot the ships remotely, so we don’t have to get involved in the fight. However, we are targets of their attack since we are on this planet. So, how are we going to protect ourselves? We can teleport out, but what if we can’t for some reason, or they attack us with a stealth ship?”

Lucas nodded towards the tank beside him. “This is how we can protect ourselves. Its armor can withstand direct thermonuclear attacks like the ones they used on this planet before. With its shields, it could withstand over a hundred thermonuclear attacks at once without flinching.” 

“During this war, we are gonna be inside the Goliath tank to avoid being killed by some sort of surprise attack. There are simulators inside the Goliath so we can directly control the ships we have from here. There are also sleeping quarters and food dispensers. We won’t want for anything inside them. It also has sufficient firepower to blow holes in anyone looking at us funny.”

Chu Shen nodded. “Wow. You really are in your element here, aren’t you. I didn’t even think about stealth ships.”

Lucas grinned. “You may be the expert in cultivation, but when it comes to technology, it’s my game.”

Chu Shen grinned back at him. “What about artificing? We are both pretty equal in that.”

Lucas paused to consider it for a moment before shaking his head. “Nope. I think I win there too.”

“Why you little! Come here and let me show you what I think of your inscriptions!” 

“Oh yeah? Well this is what I think of yours!” As Chu Shen and Lucas were  fighting, a Scout Drone interrupted them.

Walking up to them, it paused outside the range of their fists. “Privateers. Your assistance is now required.”

Lucas glanced up as his arm was bent behind his back. “What is it? We’re kind of busy at the moment.”


Chu Shen also looked at the robot as he twisted Lucas’ arm. “Yeah, if it isn’t important then give us five minutes.” He suddenly grabbed his stomach as Lucas elbowed him in the gut.

The Scout Drone seemed annoyed for a split second. Of course, this was impossible. How could a machine show annoyance? “This matter cannot wait. As of this moment, the defense forces are insufficient to defend this system against attacks. Therefore, the privateers are activated immediately.”

Lucas immediately let out a yell. “YEESSS!!!! We can finally FIGHT!”

Aslo and Chrissa came running when they heard Lucas yelling. “What is it Lucas?” Aslo asked.

“We finally got permission from rust bucket here to fight!”


Aslo immediately started celebrating as well. While he did that, Lucas turned back to the Scout Drone. “So when can we expect the next enemy fleet to arrive, and with how many forces?”

The Scout Drone immediately replied back. “The next attack will be in 6 days and 14 hours. The enemy is expected to have 10 standard fleets.”

Lucas groaned. “Great, more waiting.” He turned towards Chu Shen, Aslo, and Chrissa. “Well, I guess I can teach you guys how to pilot the ships remotely while we wait.”

Aslo looked confused. “What do you mean pilot the ships remotely? I thought we were just going to fight them with that stealth ship of yours.”

Lucas shook his head. “Of course we can’t fight with the stealth ship. With so many weapons going off, it’s basically guaranteed that the ship will be hit sometime. Because of that, our stealth will be basically meaningless. It would be better that we pilot the ships remotely to get involved in the fray directly. It’ll be like a video game, if your ship blows up then switch to another.”

Aslo was still confused. “What’s a video game?”

Lucas put an arm around Aslo’s shoulder. “Ah, my poor friend. You have been neglected since such a young age. Come with me, I’ll teach you all the things you need to know…”

Aslo immediately shoved Lucas aside. “No way would I listen to a snake like you.” He shuddered. “I remember the last time you said to trust you I got thrown over a mile by one of the mechs.”

Lucas shrugged. “Hey, it wasn’t my fault that they took my instructions to take you to new heights literally.”

Aslo looked at him in disbelief. “Then what did you think they were going to do?”

Lucas shrugged again. “No idea, I just wanted to see what they would do.”

Aslo groaned. “Of course you did.”



<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 147 - Serious Gaming</h1>

It was time for the aliens to once again invade. It had been 77 days and 14 hours since Lucas had first started construction. The total number of ships he had was almost beyond reckoning. 

696 battleships, 464 carriers, 2088 destroyers, 9280 sniper drones, 4640 shield drones, and 6960 fighters. This was the total number of ships Lucas had created. The enemy would have 100 battleships, 10 carriers, 400 destroyers, 2000 fighters, and 200 cruisers. Their forces outnumbered the enemy by at least six to one and in some cases ten to one.

All of Lucas’ ships were hidden on the backside of the fifth planet, preventing the aliens from discovering them when they invaded. Lucas was controlling a sniper drone. Aslo and Chu Shen were controlling destroyers, while Chrissa was controlling a hundred shield drones still inside the carrier. Once they deployed they would form a square shield, allowing Chrissa to manipulate them like one unit.

None of the drones except the sniper drones were released from the carrier yet. After all, the drones couldn’t teleport unlike the other ships. They would need to get close in order to fight the enemy. The sniper drones, on the other hand, wouldn’t need to get close and could fight no matter the distance.

Suddenly, the scanners lit up as the enemy jumped in. Chu Shen grinned. Finally, it was time to fight. He sighed and deactivated the simulation. According to their ‘orders’, they weren’t allowed to attack the aliens until they were even with the sixth planet. This was to avoid having some of them run away to warn future fleets of the sudden upsurge in technology. 

The AI of the Nugitraaiil would not be directing their ships, only setting down some guidelines for their attack. According to the AI, previous privateers would control their own ships, but would be told to attack certain ships or to not engage unless the enemy was in certain areas. 

This was to give the privateers autonomy and not distract them while they fought. Such privileges were not extended to the military since they were trained to take orders while fighting. They had almost total control of how to engage the enemy. However, they would have to wait for three hours before the enemy would come into their targeting envelope.

Chu Shen wasted some time chatting with Lucas and Aslo. After some good natured ribbing, along with a couple drinks, it was time to fight for real. Activating the simulation, Chu Shen was suddenly piloting a ship.

Their fleet flew out from behind the planet. Their numbers matched the enemy exactly. There was no point in scaring them off too soon after all. The fighters were half regular fighters, one quarter shield drones, and one quarter sniper drones.

They were in teleportation range. As a result, all of Lucas’ ships disappeared and reappeared behind the enemy. The destroyers formed a half sphere with the open end facing the enemy. The battleships were behind the destroyers and behind them were the carriers.

Chu Shen could see the top of his ship. The plasma cannon started to power up as he targeted an enemy carrier. Firing the large plasma projectile, he watched as it hit the carrier’s shield and sliced through it like a hot knife through butter. 

It hit the carrier directly in the middle. He must have hit the reactor or a fuel depot because the carrier exploded shortly after the plasma went through the middle of the ship. The carriers were priority targets to prevent them from launching their fighters.

Chu Shen followed the plasma projectile as it went through two enemy destroyers and one battleship, crippling the battleship and wiping out the destroyers. He looked at the energy banks of his ship and realized that he didn’t have enough power to fire another shot like that.  

Sighing, he selected several destroyers’ rear engines and activated the targeting systems. Immediately, several hundred plasma turrets on his ship started firing hundreds of plasma bolts at the targets he selected, crippling their engines and turning them into sitting ducks.

Chu Shen smiled at the destruction he was causing, but got bored after crippling his tenth destroyer. He toggled an option on his simulator, switching over to one of the fighters. The fighter had apparently been on a strafing run on a destroyer. Upon taking over, Chu Shen had to immediately dodge a laser as its bright red beam shot towards him.

Doing a barrel roll, Chu Shen pulled up, away from the destroyer. Flying away from the fight, Chu Shen gathered himself and examined the fighter’s condition. Its shields were still at a hundred percent and only a small amount of its railgun ammunition had been expended so far.

Grinning, Chu Shen quickly highlighted potential targets before zeroing in on one of the battleships. Activating the engines, he shot straight towards the enemy ship. He fired his lasers and bright red streaks of light shot towards the battleship. 

Currently the battleship was distracted by 3 other fighters, so there was almost no defensive fire coming towards him. The battleship’s shield flared to life as his lasers struck it. Unfortunately, nothing else happened even after repeated blows to its shield. 

Frustrated, Chu Shen fired two plasma bombs. The shields flickered as two blue balls of light exploded right next to it. Part of the ship’s hull became scorched as some of the plasma leaked through. Unfortunately, the ship’s shield came back online five seconds later. 

Chu Shen realized that none of his armament was doing much good against this behemoth of a ship. Honestly, fighters weren’t meant to fight these monster battleships. They were too heavily shielded to be taken out by the light armament of the fighters. Only other capital ships, like their own battleships and destroyers, could take them on in a one-on-one fight.

Right as he was about to give up, Chu Shen realized there was one weapon he still hadn’t tried. Switching over to his railgun turrets, Chu Shen looped back around for another strafing run. 

This time Chu Shen flew towards the ships engines. Firing the railguns, his ship tracked the otherwise invisible projectiles. He watched as the projectiles flew straight at the engines at over 100 times the speed of sound. 

There was a flash as the projectiles smashed through the engines and penetrated the ship’s fuel line, causing a massive explosion. The ship’s shield hadn’t even attempted to stop the railgun! Chu Shen grinned. Just like they had thought, the invaders’ ships weren’t designed to stop physical objects, only energy weapons. 

Suddenly, all of the enemy ships around him turned around. Activating their engines at full power, the enemy suddenly started fleeing from the solar system!





<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 148 - Total Annihilation</h1>

Lucas grinned as his tachyon cannon ripped a hole through the the enemy cruiser. So far, he had lost only one battleship and twenty fighters. The battleship had been destroyed by the enemy ramming it with three of their own battleships and the fighters had been lost to defensive fire. 

The enemy, on the other hand, had lost over half of their forces, including all carriers and over 90% of their fighters.

Lucas frowned as he glanced at the map of the battlefield. The enemy was fleeing the battlefield. Of course, the AI had warned him that there was a ‘91.32% chance’ that the enemy would flee. He had been expecting it. He ordered all ships to create a path for the enemy and to disperse back towards the fifth planet. 

Next he informed the others about his plans. They weren’t too happy about it, especially Aslo, but they still took his advice and piloted their ships back to their original resting place.

He activated the FTL probes that he had scattered throughout the system. The sniper drones could hit any target in real time from anywhere in the system. Unfortunately though, their scanners would start to lag as distance grew between them and their targets. 

By the time the targets reached the sixth planet, there would be a delay of three seconds. This may not seem like a lot, but remember that a spaceship can easily cover 50 miles in one second. If they were diving and rolling to avoid being hit, they could easily miss their target.

As a result, real-time targeting data needed to be relayed by his probes. Over 20,000 sniper drones flew out from behind the planet as the rest of his fleet flew back to their hiding place. Immediately, tachyon cannons fired, invisible tachyons lancing towards the enemy.

He grinned as thousands of holes appeared in the helpless ships as they tried to flee this death trap. Their numbers was instantly reduced to half of their remaining forces. Instantly, the remaining ships tried to dodge.

Their ships rolled, weaved, ducked, bobbed, looped, and corkscrewed. A couple explosions occurred as their ships accidentally rammed into the derelict husks of their former comrades.

It didn’t help. The probes shared their targeting information and the tachyon cannons relentlessly tracked the fleeing ships. Hole after hole appeared in the enemy, explosions filled the void as reactor containment failed. 

They didn’t stand a chance. Not even ten minutes passed before they were wiped out. Lucas surveyed the drifting hulks of the previously intimidating fleet. 

He gave a sadistic grin before calling his destroyers in for clean up duty. The destroyers used their plasma cannons and turrets to annihilate the enemy fleet, not letting anything remain. 

This was also in accordance with the orders he had received from the AI. The reason he was given was to not let the enemy be able discover what had killed their ships before. The AI was still trying to keep their advanced technology a secret. 

As the destroyers were busy, Lucas deactivated the simulation program. His was different than everyone else's since he was a cyborg and not a human. He didn’t need a simulator in order to fly a ship. All he needed was to activate the simulation program.  No other fancy machine was needed to plug his brain into virtual space.

Everyone else had already detached from the simulators and was waiting for him. Aslo was grinning like a maniac. He slapped Lucas on the back once he got close enough. “That, my friend, was amazing! Being able to fly like that… It was beautiful, all those explosions and the stars. I can’t wait to do it again next week.”

Chu Shen, on the other hand, was a bit puzzled by something. “Hey Lucas, we wiped the entire fleet out with those sniper drones the second they wanted to retreat, right?”

Lucas nodded. “Of course! They were no match for my fleet.” He boasted proudly.

Chu Shen nodded before asking the question he had thought of. “So why didn’t we just annihilate them whenever they jumped in? I mean, we could have easily wiped them out in a matter of minutes. Why risk ships when we can destroy them before they even get in range?”

Lucas grinned. “Well, we could, of course, destroy them with the sniper drones. I could easily produce millions of sniper drones every week, if I decided to only manufacture them. I could do all that, except…”

Chu Shen waited, but Lucas didn’t seem like he was going to continue. “And? You could do that except what?”

Lucas nodded at them. “Why, you guys, that’s what!”

Chu Shen shook his head. “I don’t get it. You mean, you didn’t do that because of us?”

Lucas grinned. “Now you get it. You see, if we did that, then we wouldn’t be able to pilot the dreadnoughts, fighters, and battleships. We’d be picking off targets from so far away that it wouldn’t be worth piloting the drones. To put it simply, we would all be super bored. This way, it’s really exciting and we still have the little ace in the hole, the sniper drones.”

Aslo nodded. “I see. So essentially you just want some excitement.”

Lucas coughed. “O-of course not. I just don’t want you guys to get bored or anything. I mean, it was really exciting, wasn’t it?”

Aslo nodded. “Yep! I wouldn’t trade it for anything else.”

“Alright. Then don’t question it anymore, capisce?”

“Fine.”

Chrissa seemed slightly shaken up though. Chu Shen sidled up next to her. “Are you alright Chrissa?”


She slowly shook her head. “So many of them died. Why do they have to die like this? Why can’t they just leave this planet alone?”

Lucas, who had overheard the conversation, immediately tried to cheer her up. “Actually Chrissa, no one died. The enemy? They’re all drones, just like the ones we’re using. They must have some sort of really developed AI or be very good at programming since they don’t appear to have FTL comms.”

Chrissa blinked. “You mean, everyone is just robots?”

Lucas nodded. “Yep. So far, it’s just two robot fleets duking it out. No one has died, so you can rest easy, okay?”

Chrissa sighed. “Thank you Lucas. I think I will sleep well tonight.”




<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 149 - Grinding Problems</h1>

Chu Shen swiveled his fighter, allowing the battleship to come into his scopes. Squeezing the trigger, he watched as a hole appeared in the nose of the ship and exited out one of its engines. A split second later, the ship flared brilliantly as its reactor realized it had lost containment and wreaked havoc on the rest of the ship. 

He sighed as he watched this happen. It just didn’t have the appeal it first had. When they had first started out, it had been exciting. Blowing up ships left and right, dodging lasers, sometimes unsuccessfully, and commanding an army of ships. All of it had been the thrill of a lifetime.

Unfortunately, no good thing ever lasts. They would wait for a week, doing nothing but sitting on their laurels. Then, for three hours, they would be forced to wait until they reached the sixth planet. For the next 30 minutes, him and his team would rip into the enemy fleet, completely demolishing them. 

Afterwards… nothing. There was literally nothing to do. The most would be vaporizing the remains of the enemy fleet so that there would be nothing left for examination by the enemy. The first two weeks was almost like a high. It was so stressful waiting for the enemy to appear even though they knew exactly when and where they would. 

During the third week, the high started to wear off. Boredom started to set in. By the fourth week, everyone was starting to think of it as a job rather then them having fun. That wasn’t a bad thing since this was technically a job anyways. However, it was still very unsatisfying for everything to be playing out like this.

Chu Shen sighed before blowing up another ship. He couldn’t find a solution to this boredom problem though. Luckily, he was having a pretty good time handling it since cultivation was naturally boring. After ten minutes, the enemy fleet was destroyed and he signed out of his simulator.

Lucas, on the other hand, was having to deal with a headache. He rubbed his temple as he stared at the display in front of him. ‘This just won’t do. The enemy's numbers keep increasing no matter how many we destroy. We can continue replacing the ships and manufacturing more. That isn’t the problem though.’ 

‘In four years, the numbers will be so astronomical that we would have literally dissolved the entire planet in order to keep producing ships. Then what would be the point in protecting it?’

That was the true issue. While the ARD was truly miraculous, it still needed resources to operate. Those resources might be common, but they would still be consumed eventually. 

Already their efforts in ship construction had erased over a hundred square foot of rock and dirt over three hundred miles deep. That might seem crazy, but a single fight needed a hundred square feet of earth in materials. With the amount of ships made so far, they definitely needed that much dirt.

In twenty years, the entire solar system would be consumed in order to match the output of the enemy ships. Of course, maybe the enemy was also running low on resources as well. In war though, one couldn’t hope for the best. You planned for the worst.

Lucas started to think of something. He pulled up an old historic battle that Earth had once fought with pirates in the asteroid belt. Looking over the details, he started nodding. This might work. Of course, he was going to need to make a couple things. Several things in fact. After that, maybe next week wouldn’t be so boring.

Contacting the AI, he started proposing his plan. After ten minutes of nonstop talking, the AI agreed. Together they refined his plan for an hour before both of them were in agreement. Afterwards, they contacted the rest of the team.

Chu Shen faced Lucas as he started to reveal the details of their predicament. Whenever he mentioned the fact that the planet would have to become fuel for them, Chu Shen immediately realized that just sitting here playing defense was never going to workout.

Lucas paused to let everyone absorb what he said but Chu Shen wasn’t ready to wait. “So Lucas, what are you suggesting we do? We obviously can’t just sit here doing nothing.”

“I was waiting for someone to ask that. Me and the tin can over there,” he nodded at the scout drone in the corner of the room, “have been plotting a little something.”

“Now obviously we can’t just fire up the engines at full throttle and attack the enemy head-on. For one, we don’t know where these things are coming from. For another, even if we did, we don’t have the capabilities of interstellar-travel. Short range hyperspace jumping is nothing, but to achieve true hyperspace we need a lot more power than these tiny ships have.”

“I talked with the AI and we have a solution. We can create a stealth missile for my ship, the original one, that will not contain explosives, but nanites instead. The nanites have tachyon-comm capability so we can immediately trace where they are located.”

“We can also build hyperspace-relays. Essentially, they would be huge ships that can create a tunnel through hyperspace to wherever we need to go. Now the tricky part is finding out where the enemy is. I planned it out with some help from the AI and this is the result.”

“We are going to have some of our battleships equipped with railguns join its rebuilt fleet. Just like the past few times, we should be able to wipe out most of the enemy fleet without trouble, and then the enemy will try and make a break for it. We need to tag one of the ships that is going to get away with some nanites while we attempt to hunt the rest of the ships down.” 

“After the ship we tagged gets away, we will then send in the stealth ship and several probes to the ship’s location. We will attempt to find the location of one of their factories, ship storage facilities, or at least a colony. Afterwards, we can mount a strike on them.

Chu Shen was immediately intrigued by the plan. He had never thought about trying what they were going to do, but it seemed like it was doable. Aslo, on the other hand, was not as supportive. He didn’t like losing, even if it was supposed to be a ploy to defeat the enemy once and for all.

Chrissa managed to convince him otherwise, pointing out that they would literally have to destroy the planet they were supposed to be protecting in order to continue to fight. Doing it this way meant saving the planet fromt themselves. Facing this kind of insurmountable logic, Aslo had no choice but to surrender.

With his team behind him a hundred percent, Lucas got busy changing the fabricators’ orders. Big spheres slowly started to take form in front of the fabricator. Multiple specially designed stealth missiles also appeared in the fabricator before being taken to Lucas’ stealth ship.

The day before the invasion, the preparations were finally completed. It was time to defend their planet. If they played their cards right, they just might be able to take the fight to the enemy for once.


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 150 - Plan Start</h1>

An hour before the start of the invasion, Lucas started lining up ships. Placing his stealth ship in orbit around the seventh planet, he ordered its stealth systems to be activated ten minutes before the enemy usually invaded.

Communicating with the AI, he coordinated their attacks. Aslo, Chu Shen, and Chrissa were not allowed to participate in this fight. He was worried they might do something dumb like activate their teleporters. 

Currently the only technology they wanted to reveal was the railgun turrets. Just that should be enough to make the drones want to run and inform their ‘masters’ of the advanced technology they had. There was no need to inform the enemy of their other capabilities, such as the tachyon cannon.

Right now they had matched the enemy's numbers with the AI’s ships. It apparently had never stopped manufacturing ships, even though its industrial capabilities were badly outmatched.  The battleships were the only ships that were not made by the AI and had been replaced by Lucas’ battleships.

This fleet had positioned themselves in orbit around the sixth planet, placing the planet between them and the emergence point of the invaders so as to avoid detection. At the expected time, the enemy jumped in.

Finally, it was time to enact their plan.

First, the AI moved all of its ships towards the enemy. Fighters launched and engaged in dogfights with the enemy’s fighters. Lasers and plasma bolts streaked across the void of space, causing shields to flare to life all over the arena. Ships exploded as their shields failed, exposing their weak armor to the rigours of superheated plasma. 

After thirty minutes, the entire AI fleet had been wiped out. The enemy only had a third of their fleet left with most of it being the heavy battleships and some destroyers. Without the support of their own battleships, since Lucas was withholding them at the moment, they didn’t have enough firepower to take down the heavily shielded behemoths. 

As a result, they were limited to harrying actions on the battleships and mainly focused on the less-protected destroyers and fighters. At the same time though, the enemy battleships only had large-bore plasma cannons and laser arrays. 

The huge weapons, while powerful, couldn’t turn as fast as their smaller counterparts. As a result, they couldn’t keep up with the smaller ships’ agility, though they were able to come to bear on some of the destroyers. It had come down to each sides smaller ships clashing with the occasional lucky hit landed by the enemy battleships.

Now that the AI’s fleet was destroyed, it was Lucas’ time to shine. The enemy ships turned towards him and lit up their engines. The handful of fighters shot towards the front of his formation. Before they came into laser range though, the suddenly split apart, going completely vertical.

Lucas realized they were just trying to distract his ships and draw fire. Ignoring the pitiful attempts at distraction, he ordered his battleships forwards in an arrow formation. His ships were layered so that each one had a clear view of the space in front of it.

Firing their railguns, Lucas’ battleships focused on the enemy battleships, completely ignoring the more agile destroyers. The railguns’ range was, theoretically, unlimited. The projectiles would continue through the void of space, unhindered by the confines of gravity. Lasers and plasma, on the other hand, would lose focus and dissipate. 

As a result, Lucas’ battleships was able to fire as soon as he ordered. They were currently outside of laser range, meaning there was no return fire yet. Soon, the enemy started to realize something was wrong.

The first indication that they had that they were under attack was when one of the battleships lost half of its engines. Shortly after, multiple holes appeared in the ship until it promptly exploded. 

It seemed as though the ship exploding was a signal of some sort. Over fifteen battleships exploded within seconds of each other. Realizing they were under fire, the enemy started to conduct evasive measures. Another thirty battleships exploded before they could get out of the way of the incoming projectiles.

Soon though, the enemy had reached the farthest range of their lasers. The plasma cannons still needed some time in order to get into range. Several of Lucas’ battleships started to get low on shields as groups of twenty enemy battleships focused in on specific ships. 

Upon reaching 30% shield integrity, Lucas’ ships slowed down, dropping out of formation. Other battleships took their place as the ones they replaced tried to replenish their shields’ energy. Like this, Lucas avoided too many casualties until they started to form groups of 30 to hunt his ships down. 

Since they were no longer in the extreme range of his railgun turrets, Lucas decided it was time to stop with the kiddy gloves. Ordering his battleships to go to fully automatic, he started to return fire. Over a thousand projectiles per second from 1 turret. 10 turrets firing at once. From 150 battleships. It was a slaughter.

The enemy battleships started turning into swiss cheese within seconds of the order. This might seem exaggerated, but it was completely normal. A single railgun projectile can punch a three foot wide hole upon entry through the armor of a battleship and make a twelve foot hole upon exiting the ship. Imagine over a hundred of those hitting all over the ship.

A laser could burn a five-foot hole through a battleship. However, it took over ten lasers to take a shield down 30% in two minutes. A railgun projectile ignored shields, however. With no protective measures at all, the enemy battleships were, essentially, sitting ducks with a slightly annoying beak.

All of the destroyers suddenly lit up their engines and fled the system. The battleships, along with the pitifully few fighters and their carriers, charged right down the battleships throats. Within fifteen minutes, all of the enemy forces were annihilated. The destroyers, though, had managed to gain a significant lead on him. 

Realizing that the enemy was now free from distractions, the destroyers started to conduct evasive maneuvers. Lucas ordered his battleships to start firing on the enemy. Identifying 8 destroyers that were the least damaged, he ordered those destroyers to be the ‘miss’ targets. Now his battleships would deliberately miss shots on those destroyers.

After about ten minutes, the 49 enemy dreadnoughts that had fled was reduced to sixteen. Now they were out of the railguns conceivable range. It was so far that it would take the railguns one minute to cover the distance. With that much time, the enemy could certainly avoid the incoming projectiles. Assuming they could see them that is.

Lucas kept his battleships chasing after them, even though it was obviously futile. While they were busy following his orders, Lucas activated his stealth ship. The ship closed in on the enemy destroyers. 

Firing its missiles, they closed in on the enemy. The missiles flew rapidly until they were even with the enemy ships. Matching velocities, they activated their programming. The missiles had small hatches the size of the tip of a pen open all along its sides. 

Thousands of nanites flew out of the hatches and attached themselves onto the enemy ships. The nanites matched the same color as the outside of the enemy ships. Activating their Tachyon comms, they sent a small pulse to Lucas, confirming their activity. 

The eight ships he had tagged as ‘miss’ targets had received the nanite payload. Upon reaching their entrance point, the enemy destroyers disappeared into hyperspace. Lucas grinned.

It looked like it was finally time to enact part two.










<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 151 - Bastion of Evil</h1>

The second stage of the plan was now a go. Stealth probes would be sent after the enemy destroyers came out of hyperspace. These stealth probes were twenty foot long, five foot wide cylinders. What was essentially a battery was plugged into the probes to power them in order to keep space low. They were equipped with advanced sensor technology and would teleport over fifty thousand miles away from the coordinates they would receive so as to avoid detection.

After five minutes, they got a signal from one of the tagged ships. After about ten minutes they received signals from three of their ships. One minute later, signals from the other five ships they had tagged became available. The reason for the delay was because of when the ships had reached the jump point.

Checking the signal, he realized all 8 signals were coming from the same location. He waited thirty minutes in order to confirm that this was their final destination. It was a common security protocol to many species to have ships jump to multiple destinations in order to prevent their enemies from tracking them. 

After the thirty minutes were up, 12 probes jumped into the system. Activating their sensor package, telescopes popped out. Being fifty thousand miles away from their target, they would see everything happening there two seconds later then it had.

Cameras on the outsides of the probes allowed them to see what was directly outside their stealthed surfaces. Lucas let Chu Shen, Aslo, and Chrissa see the video feeds.

What he could see stunned him beyond belief. Huge ships the size of a moon were all around him. Ships the size of fifty battleships constantly entered the huge ships. After four hundred, he had to stop counting the moon-sized ships. Lucas commanded one of the probes to teleport above the solar system in order to get a clearer view of the planet. 

Once there, Lucas realized what was going on. Those huge ships were manufacturing plants. The only reason he realized this was because of the constant streams of fighters coming out of the open bays. 

The huge ships Lucas saw going between the manufacturing plants would enter one of the manufacturing plants before going to one of the planets. There something would be unloaded onto the ship before it would take off for the manufacturing plants once again.

Lucas saw that the planet was literally falling apart. Holes had been drilled through the entire planet. Gouts of magma could be seen constantly spewing up from the the core of the planet. Multiple parts of the planet seemed to have caved in, supporting the assumption that the entire planet was riddled with holes. 

This was something Lucas had experience with. It was called strip mining in his world. The entire planet would be mined, over and over and over again. It would eventually reach the point where there was no safe place to mine on the planet’s crust and the materials one needed to mine in the first place would be gone. 

So one would then puncture holes from the crust to the planet’s mantle. Magma, rich in metals and minerals, would then flow up the holes creating more places to mine. This process would repeat until the entire planet collapsed into itself and had no more mining opportunities available. 

It was a terrible thing. 

Two corporations had decided to utilize this strip mining tactic in Lucas’ universe. A news reporter had gotten wind of the tragedy and filmed the process before going live. The outcry it generated was on the same scale as Hitler's attempted genocide of the Jews. 

As a result, both corporations ended up losing all business deals and no other company would buy the materials they mined. Every school had it placed in their history books as a reminder of what could happen if greed got out of control. That was how Lucas was able to recognize what was going on here.

Finally working up the guts to count, Lucas started getting a tally of the number of the huge manufacturing plants. 819 plants. That was the final number he had reached through all 12 probes.

The issue was that Lucas could see that all of these were robots. Not a single living thing had been spotted yet. These were machines. Semi-intelligent machines as evidenced by their tactics but machines nonetheless. They couldn’t have built all this on their own, they had to have been instructed. But by who? And why? Just what was their purpose?

These horrific machines hadn’t even attempted to communicate with the Nugitraaiilians. They had immediately opened fire on everyone close to them. This meant that they weren’t going to be negotiating with them. They hadn’t even declared war on the Nugitraaiilians or sent a warning message. They just exterminated.

Lucas realized that they were going to have to do more then just attack the manufacturing plants. Instead they were going to have to locate the brain behind this operation. If they could find the operators of these robots then they could attack them and disable the robots, probably.

They were, eventually, going to have to attack this system. Keeping this in mind, Lucas started to survey the entire system for defense systems. Focusing on the location of the tagged destroyers, he saw what could only be a command center.

A huge cube-shaped battle station half the size of the enormous manufacturing plants was located at the exact coordinates of the destroyers. Large cannons of various sorts and miniature barrels poked out of the entire surface of the craft. Numerous hatches could be seen as well on the battle station. As he watched, one of the hatches slid open, allowing a cruiser to slide out of the internals of the battle station.

He realized that the destroyers he tagged must have gone inside the battle station. He saw the battleship start to head for the outskirts of the system, presumably to jump somewhere. Jolting upwards, Lucas realized that this was a golden opportunity!

These robots must be reporting the advanced technology of their foes to their masters! At least, that was the conclusion Lucas came up with. They could also be sending out a scouting party to another system, but the timing of it made Lucas suspicious. It hadn’t even been an hour since the tagged destroyers had arrived.

Tracking the battleship, Lucas decided he was going to do it. Activating his stealth ship, he jumped it into the enemy system. With his stealth systems activated, the enemy had no idea it was there. Getting closer to the enemy battleship, his ship locked the battleship into its targeting system.

Firing a tagging missile at the battleship, he marked it just like he had the destroyers. The ping came back, proving the nanites were active. 

Lucas grinned as the battleship jumped out of the system. 
It was finally time to discover just who was pulling the strings on this robo-pinocchio.


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 152 - The Masters</h1>

Lucas became confused as he saw the coordinates of the battleship he had tagged. It had jumped out of the system and then jumped more than ten times within the next hour. It had finally stopped in the middle of deep space and remained there for the past thirty minutes.

Deep space is a term used for space that is not a part of any celestial body or solar system. Essentially, it was empty, a true void. There was literally nothing there. No planets, suns, comets, or asteroids. There was just… nothing.

Lucas puzzled over this quandary. There were no resources there, so no life could have possibly formed in the void of space. So, why would the battleship go there? Shrugging, he realized that there was no way to know for certain until he sent his stealth probes. 

Activating their hyperdrive, he sent the probes to the battleship’s location. Unfortunately, the probes would no longer have enough power to activate the hyperdrive engines, so this would be the last place the probes could jump to.

Lucas had been ignoring his friends’ reactions to the probes’ video that he was livestreaming to them. It was quite easy, actually, to ignore them, because they were in another tank. He was just starting to receive video from the probes when he heard a thump coming from outside.

Switching video feed from the probes to the sensors on the outside of the tank, he could see Aslo standing next to it. Raising his hand once again, Aslo knocked on the side of the tank. Thump. “Lucas! Open up!”

Lucas sighed. He yelled back at Aslo. “What do you want?!”

“I wanna talk!”

“Go away! I’m busy!”

“No! I’m not gonna stop until-Hey! Hey! Let go of me you dumb ox! I’m gonna burn you if you don’t le-!”

Lucas watched as Chu Shen mysteriously appeared behind Aslo during his rant and grabbed his arms, wrapping him in a bear hug. Aslo immediately started struggling, but Chu Shen’s arms didn’t budge an inch. When he was called an ox, Chu Shen frowned, covering Aslo’s mouth with one of his hands.

Glancing up at the camera, he showed a helpless expression. “Sorry Lucas, Aslo got a little bored. He snuck out while me and Chrissa were talking and I noticed it only a couple seconds ago. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure he doesn’t come over here to bother you again until the scouting is done. See ya!” 

With that said, Chu Shen hoisted Aslo’s struggling body over his shoulder. Circles of light appeared under his feet and he disappeared from Lucas’ sensor range with ten seconds. Lucas was, however, able to detect a sudden surge of heat before he lost sight of Chu Shen.

Lucas sighed. Aslo was certainly a handful. Energetic, eager for a fight, arrogant, and he got bored very easily. Not to mention dumb. He was definitely meant to fight and not lead. Turning back to the probes’ scans, Lucas started to see why the tagged battleship had went to the puzzling coordinates

It was a rogue planet. Rogue planets are planets that formed without a solar system. Without a sun to orbit around, they float aimlessly through space. Such planets have extremely cold temperatures on the surface, but a vast majority of them also have an atmosphere. This is a result of the lack of a sun to disrupt even the most fragile of atmospheres.

This particular planet looked like Neptune, a gas giant that was blue in color. The core of the planet was dark blue with swirls of a lighter blue strewn throughout the entirety of the planet. The probes could detect some metallic structures deep inside the planet, presumably by the dense core of it, where the pressure of the planet was the most intense.

The battleship was parked in the orbit of the rogue planet. The probes could detect signals between it and the metal structures below. Maneuvering itself in space, the probe moved between the battleship and the structure below. With this maneuver, the probe could pick up the signals passively without alerting the enemy and relay them to Lucas.

“(*$&^(@*#^^@)(#%**%$#)($^&&&!%@%^#$#@. @&&^*&$#@@$$#@%%$@!#%).” The sounds of the transmission was harsh, like that of cymbals clashing and metal being sawed. Lucas covered his ears and immediately shut down the audio. The probe was already recording so it wasn’t a big deal for him to shut off the audio.

Running his translation software on the recording, Lucas hoped that he would get lucky. Sometimes it would take up to a month to receive an accurate translation. If they continued talking, the translation time would go down.

After he set up the translation software, Lucas started manipulating the probe so as to get a closer scan of the planet. Focusing on the area of the metallic structure, Lucas activated the scanners. Unfortunately, a visual was not available due to the thick atmosphere.

They were able to collect a 3d-image of the metallic structure from his other sensor apparatus though. From all appearances it was a communication relay. It was floating on a helium/hydrogen/methane concoction which had turned into a liquid from the temperature and pressure. The entire thing resembled an open hand with the open part pointing away from the battleship above.

Swimming in the liquid gases beside the comm relay was a blob. Tentacles stuck out of it, making it resemble a large jellyfish. Then he watched as the jellyfish reached one of its tentacles into the open sides of the comm relay. The constant stream of communication that the probe had recorded suddenly cut off after the jellyfish touched the inside of the comm relay.

Lucas positioned six probes evenly across the entire planet's surface and started locating multiple of these jellyfish things. All of them were two hundred miles above the planet’s core. Lucas watched as one went above that imaginary limit and it shuddered as though it was in pain before immediately fleeing back towards the border.

‘Ah. These creatures are very pressure sensitive. It makes sense though considering the fact that they evolved here, on such a highly-pressurized planet.’ Lucas could come to several conclusions from watching this one event and using the experience of other alien species in his own dimension.

Creatures that live in high pressure environments cannot go to a low pressure environment without dying. They simply cannot adjust to the low pressure and promptly explode. It is the same with deep-sea creatures being brought to the surface on Earth. 

Since it is not such a dramatic change in pressure on Earth, some creatures can survive for weeks. However, the pressure difference on this planet compared to Earth is a magnitude of several thousand. It’s simply not comparable.

In Lucas’ dimension, such creatures living on gas giants like this were not a part of advanced civilization. The fact was that creating advanced electronics was almost impossible on such a planet. There were just too many chemicals that could interfere.

Even if they were given a spaceship, the amount of energy needed just to exit the gravity well would be too immense for almost any ship to make it off. Not to mention the fact that the sudden change in pressure from their world to the weightlessness of space would almost certainly kill anyone attempting. In order to successfully create an advanced race on planets like this, specialized equipment would need to be made. Equipment that was impossible to get to work on planets like these.

Lucas frowned. These creatures were obviously able to get around these problems since they were in space. But how did they do it? Lucas had no idea. 

What he did need to do though, was stop them from destroying the Nugitraaiilain’s planet.


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 153 - The Plan</h1>

Lucas needed to come up with a plan. Luckily, he had an alien AI and at least two smart friends. The third was doubtful at best. He kept the stealth probes around the jellyfish planet to try and intercept more communication attempts while keeping three probes at the manufacturing location to monitor the ships located there.

Afterwards, he contacted Chu Shen through the tank’s comm and asked to hold a strategy meeting. Chu Shen agreed and asked him to come over to their tank since everyone except him was over there already. Lucas also contacted the AI and asked for it to have a scout drone present at the meeting so it could put its two cents in. The AI was confused by the metaphor, but it agreed nonetheless.

Lucas arrived within ten minutes and found the scout drone to be waiting beside the tank. Signaling Chu Shen, they opened the tank door and climbed in. Soon afterwards, Lucas found himself sitting at an almost crowded table with the rest of the crew.

Everyone just sat there awkwardly before Lucas took charge. “Alright people, I need ideas on how we’re going to beat the jellyfish.”

Aslo immediately shot up. “We blow them up!”

Lucas facepalmed. “Yes, Aslo, we can do that.” He glanced around the table. “Are there any other, more strategic ideas?”

Chu Shen spoke up next. “Why did you call them jellyfish? I thought they were robots.” Chrissa nodded as well.

Lucas looked at them, shock on his face. “What do you mean? The whole point of this scouting mission was to discover who was behind the robots attacking us. I found out who they were, it was included in the livestream I was sending you. If you were watching it then you should’ve known that.”


Chu Shen looked sheepishly at Lucas. “Well…. I kinda sparred with Aslo after stopping him from bugging you.”

Lucas looked at him. “So you decided to fight Aslo to stop him from disturbing me again?”

Aslo immediately decided to butt in. “No he didn’t. It was because I burned his arm that he got all mad and started fighting.”

Lucas turned to Chrissa. “Did you at least watch the video?”

Chrissa shook her head. “I had stop the boys from fighting so I didn’t get to watch the last part of it.”

Lucas sighed. “All that work for nothing.”

Chrissa comforted Lucas. “It wasn’t for nothing. We still need it, we just didn’t get to watch it at that moment, that’s all. We should probably watch it now so we know what it is you’re going to be talking about.” She turned to Chu Shen and Aslo. “Isn’t that right boys?”

“Yes ma'am!” Both boys replied in unison. Chrissa may be shy and not very outspoken, but if she was helping someone and you got in the way… Let’s just say that you never wanted to mess with her unless you were prepared to lose a couple fingers.

Lucas brightened up at that. “Alright then. Besides, I don’t believe the AI ever got a chance to see it either, correct?” He glanced at the scout drone.

The scout drone nodded, a habit it had picked up from the humans when it observed them. “Negative. I did not receive any recording and had no knowledge of any of this until this meeting.”

“Then it’s settled.” Lucas activated the display in the room and started selecting portions of the film to watch. Within three minutes he had reduced the video down to twenty minutes with a brief survey of both locations and a focus of the jellyfish and what they looked like according to the scanners.

There was some gasps heard at the very end when they saw the scan of the jellyfish. Surprisingly there was no surprise about the manufacturing ships, probably because they had actually been paying attention that time. After the video ended, Lucas explained the limitations heavy gravity creatures often had. Afterwards he only asked them what they thought he should do.

Chu Shen shrugged. “I have some ideas but I’m not sure about them. What we can do is try and communicate with these jellyfish. Have your probes try and come up with an accurate translation. Then maybe we can understand why they’re attacking us and what we can do.”

Aslo shook his head. “No. What we should do is invade and immediately destroy all of the manufacturing ships. Without them, we don’t have to worry about their fleets coming to attack us. Then we can force them to stay isolated on their planet.”

Chrissa nodded. “I think we should try and talk with them. If they refuse then we can destroy the manufacturing ships. We still have some weapons they don’t know about yet.”

Lucas looked at the robot in the corner. “What is your opinion on this, AI?”

The scout drone’s immediate response surprised all of them. “The correct course of action would be to first destroy the alien world and then destroy their manufacturing capabilities. With their world under attack, there is a 91.964% probability of the invaders recalling their fleet, leaving their manufacturing sites defenseless. With this, there is a 52.183% chance that the manufacturing ships will be destroyed without a single loss.”

Chrissa gasped at the cold logic. To immediately destroy the other side without even giving them a way to escape… How cruel! This was pure logic at its best. Aslo seemed hesitant before eventually giving a decisive nod. Chu Shen frowned and Lucas shook his head.

Lucas decided to inform the robot of his opinion. “While logic dictates that is the direction we should take, we will not take such action. I believe Chrissa’s idea holds the most merit.”

The scout drone turned to look at Lucas. “Your chances of success drop from 98.826% to 92.722%. Such loss in probabilities is within the acceptable range given for emotional decisions of commanders. You decision is approved and may be carried out after approval by me.”

Lucas nodded. “Okay. Then let me go ahead and lay out the plans I have. Meanwhile, the stealth probes are going to continue to compile an accurate translation program so we can talk to them.”

Everyone agreed with Lucas’ assessment. For the next two hours, they argued about where to put what ships, how to attack the enemy and why, what they should say to the aliens, what they would do if the aliens refused to surrender, and if they should completely wipe out the aliens or just impose a ban on spacecraft.

After the two hours were done, they had finally decided what to do. With their plan complete, it was time to set it in action.


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 154 - First Contact</h1>


It took ten days before the probes were finally able to come up with an accurate translation program. During that time, they had to fight off one enemy attack. The enemy fleet kept one ship that presumably recorded the entire fight before jumping back to the manufacturing plant. Just like last time, the only unique weapons used were the railguns.
After the translation program came in, Lucas set his plans into motion. One necessary part of his plan was for him to be on the ship to make contact with the jellyfish.
What he needed to do was to interact with jellyfish personally. He wasn’t sure how they would react to seeing him since they were aliens after all. What he could be sure of was that receiving a message would be far too impartial. At least, that had been the usual reaction from his dimension’s past. 
Humans had imagined other life out there, and many alien civilizations had also imagined other forms of life. Receiving a message from an alien species without an image of the alien itself was often met with suspicion and sometimes outright hostility. The best psychologists of the the human species came to the conclusion that all species had an innate fear of the unknown. 
Receiving a message with an alien’s body or face included was often met with, again, suspicion and mostly peaceful gestures. Of course, this was under the assumption one wanted peace. If you wanted war or subjugation, it would always be met with hostility no matter if you had a selfie included or not.
Lucas, of course, wanted peace. So, taking his species long history as an example, he decided to be onboard the ship when it made contact. Which was why he was in orbit around the jellyfish planet whenever his ship came out of hyperspace.
Activating the comms, he sent a message down to the planet on the same frequency as the battleship he’d tagged had. All the message said was ‘hello.’ The probes tracked one of the jellyfish closest to the comm relay station as it  immediately took off. The probes had identified over two thousand comm relay stations, but this one was the only one they had a frequency for. The others wouldn’t pick up their broadcast.
The jellyfish arrived at the station and paused there for one minute. Afterwards, Lucas’ ship picked up an incoming response in the alien language which was automatically translated. “Who call us? The messenger left ten units.”
Lucas opened a video link to the relay. Upon opening it he saw a blob with one large eye floating in front of the camera. When the blob-like jellyfish, saw Lucas, it recoiled in shock. It floated a good four feet from the camera before slowly swimming back.
“You are alien.” The alien’s response was a statement. Lucas had no idea what to make of that.
“Yes, I am an alien. One that is being invaded by a fleet composed of robots.” Lucas decided to be blunt. He really didn’t have time to be wasting.
“Robots informed us of threat. Are you threat?”
“I believe so, yes.”
“The robots not ours. Once were, no longer.”
Lucas frowned. “Are you saying that you built these robots?”
“Affirmative. Once owned, no longer owned.”
“These robots are rogue? They are destroying species on their own?”
“Robots ordered to explore and destroy threats. Interpret wrong. Threats include all intelligent life. Try to stop. Interpret order as threat. Order ignored.”
Lucas immediately recalled the Gu’tloop. They were a species that hadn’t reached FTL capabilities and instead built robot probes. These probes were ordered to explore the universe and eliminate threats to the Gu’tloop existence. Four hundred years later, the Gu’tloop had reached the stars but couldn’t find any neighbors. 
They eventually found out that the robot probes had followed their orders to eliminate threats. Unfortunately, the order meant that any life form could eventually become a threat to the Gu’tloop and therefore must be eliminated. As a result, life in all forms around the Gu’tloop had been wiped out. Luckily the robot probes ran into humans who had promptly destroyed all traces of them through viruses designed by their AIs.
Comparing that situation with the one they were in, there were many parallels. Apparently the jellyfish had created robots since they themselves couldn’t explore the universe. 
He decided to ask the jellyfish some more questions. “Would you like the robots to stop?”
“Robots stop satisfactory. Extreme joy if done.”
“If I could do so, would you warn the robots?”
“Negative. Robots never harm creators, robots harm invaders. Robots’ watchers know of invader. We warn invader danger. Robots coming soon.”
After Lucas puzzled through that sentence, he immediately accessed the probes still in the manufacturing plant. Right as he did so, a fleet of two hundred cruisers suddenly vanished as they reached jump range. They appeared, two seconds later, all around Lucas.
Lucas looked around at the cruisers surrounding him. “Great. This is one party I wish I wasn’t invited to.”
Lasers ripped into Lucas’ ship, causing it to vanish in a large explosion. The jellyfish below had multiple ripples flow through its body, appearing to shudder as its comm with Lucas’ ship suddenly vanished.
A robotic voice came from the comm relay in the jellyfish language. “Intruder has been dealt with. Further contact with invaders is prohibited. Making contact with the invaders must be punished so as to prevent further threat to the Hulthan race.”
With that said, fifty cruisers fired their plasma cannons with robotic precision straight down at the planet. The combined might allowed the plasma to penetrate through the planet’s thick atmosphere, reaching the Hulthan that had been communicating with Lucas.
A shrill squeal could be heard for a brief second as the superheated plasma reached their target. The Hulthan exploded as its flammable interior was breached by the star-hot plasma. A trail of fire from where the superheated plasma had penetrated the atmosphere could be seen. 
The hydrogen and methane gas in the atmosphere had lit on fire from the heat of the plasma passing through it. A couple seconds later, the freezing temperatures of the gas giant and the helium gas put out the fire, leaving not a single trace of the pitiful Hulthan as it attempted to correct its species’ atrocious mistake.



<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 155 - Sadness</h1>

Lucas switched to one of his spare bodies inside his pocket dimension. Teleporting himself to the Nugitraiilian homeworld, Lucas found himself aboard his stealth ship sitting in his command chair. The ship he had taken to the jellyfish homeworld was an unarmored and unshielded cruiser, which was why it had been destroyed so easily.

He opened the feed from the probes to see what would happen after his ship was destroyed. He watched as the robots fired plasma bolts into the jellyfish planet. A sinking feeling in his gut caused him to order the probes to scan the area they were firing at. He fell back into his chair as he realized that the alien jellyfish he had been talking to had been murdered.

Lucas just stared at the screen. If he had tear ducts, his eyes would have started tearing up. To have someone try and help you, only to be killed in return… what kind of feeling would one have? Lucas was being torn up by guilt. There was a flicker of movement as one of the robot ships on the screen moved out of the jellyfish homeworld’s gravity. Without the gravity disrupting hyperspace, the robot ships jumped out of the system.

Lucas’ head whipped around, staring where the robot ships had been just seconds ago. There was a shriek of tortured metal as the armrests on Lucas’ chair crumpled under his strength. Chu Shen had been in his cabin when he had sensed a slight change in the surrounding Qi. Realizing it must be Lucas coming back, Chu Shen headed for the bridge.

Arriving there, he saw Lucas staring daggers at an image of empty space. He turned to question what Lucas was doing and noticed that Lucas’ armrests had been crumpled up into a ball. He ran over to Lucas. “What is it Lucas? What’s wrong?!”

Lucas shifted his gaze towards Chu Shen, causing Chu Shen to flinch. “What’s wrong?” Lucas’ voice was quiet but it carried a deep anger with it. A chill came over Chu Shen.

“I’ll tell you what’s wrong. I made contact with the jellyfish. They told me that they had created these abominations to explore the universe. Their creations started killing everything! They tried to stop the killing! They even tried to warn ME! DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?! THEY KILLED HIM FOR IT! THEY KILLED HIM! BECAUSE OF ME!” Lucas gradually became louder until he was shouting at Chu Shen.

After he was done yelling, Lucas slumped back into his chair. He seemed to age by ten years. Lucas sobbed, but not a single tear fell down from his face. “I killed him. I killed him and I can’t even cry. Why? Why didn’t I make tear ducts? Now I can’t even cry for who I killed.”

Chu Shen came over to Lucas and hugged him. “It’s okay Lucas. It’s okay.” He knew exactly what kind of soul Lucas was. He was a kind and caring boy, coming from a more gentle age. It was the reason why they had gotten involved with Aslo and Chrissa to begin with. To have someone die for him… It was truly torture for Lucas.

Maybe if it was Chu Shen this wouldn’t be as much of a problem. He wasn’t heartless, but Chu Shen had been raised in a far more brutal era. People being killed was quite common. Of the four hundred young people of his generation, only a hundred and fifty-two branch sect children had survived to adulthood. The kids were killed in training or in accidents while hunting. Some were even killed in cultivation mishaps. Death was a constant companion in his world, so a stranger dying, even if it was for him, wouldn’t have torn him up so much.

After a while, Lucas finally stopped mourning. Standing up he reflexively rubbed his eyes before glancing down at his hand. He made a sad smile before turning back to Chu Shen. “Thanks for being there Chu Shen.”

Chu Shen smiled. “It’s alright. I won’t say anything to Aslo or Chrissa either.”

Lucas shuddered. “Yeah. Aslo would be awful to deal with.”

Chu Shen gestured to the video of empty space. “So, you going to destroy those ‘abominations?’ Or do you want to let them go free?”

A fire seemed to appear in Lucas’ eyes. He shook his head decisively. “I’ll prepare the warp gates. We need to wipe all of the robots out. Right now.”

Lucas sat back down in his chair. Closing his eyes, Lucas entered a virtual reproduction of the solar system in real time. Issuing orders, Lucas prepared to destroy the robot invaders.

953 battleships, 637 carriers, 2860 destroyers, 12760 sniper drones, 6378 shield drones, and 9516 fighters. This huge amount of ships started moving out from their places in orbit around various planets. The ships formed up into their fleet formations as ordered. 

In the middle of each fleet were the carriers. Surrounding the carriers in sphere formations were battleships. Surrounding those battleships in their own miniature spheres were the destroyers. The fighters had already been loaded onto the carriers which was why there were none of them around. If one looked at it with a telescope from a distance, it would look like ball with cancer.

The fleets formed in the space between the sixth and seventh planets into ten even formations. There was a flash of light and then ten huge spherical ships suddenly appeared beside each of the ten fleets.

Chu Shen gathered Aslo and Chrissa onboard Lucas’ ship and informed them of what had happened when Lucas made contact with the jellyfish. Of course, he left out how much it hurt Lucas, but everything else was accurate. Aslo reacted in his typical fashion. Rage and the thirst for killing things.

Chrissa gasped and then stated she wanted to destroy the robots, though she did confirm with Chu Shen that they weren’t alive but were more like rogue puppets. Afterwards, Chrissa became firm in her decision to wipe out the robotic plague.

They all gathered on the bridge where Lucas was sitting. Lucas had programmed his face and voice to simulate his normal attitude. He didn’t want them to know how badly he was failing.

“Is everyone ready to destroy the robots?” Lucas asked the group. As one, everyone nodded. “Alright. I hereby begin the assault!”

As Lucas spoke, the huge spherical ships started splitting apart. The upper half of each ship started peeling apart, forming 8 equal sized wedges. The wedges went out to 45 degree angles before stopping. A huge rod with a ball at the end emerged from the middle of the sphere. Rods from the tips of wedges shot out and connected with the ball at the end of the sphere.

A bluish-white energy surged across the rods, collecting at the ball at the end of the main rod. The bluish-white energy swirled and shimmered before suddenly expanding. A huge portal appeared in front of the spherical ships. When the portals stopped expanding, they were twice the size of each fleet formation.

Immediately after the portals formed, the fleets surged towards them. The fleets flew into the portals disappearing from view. 

Lucas had a sad smile on his face as he saw them disappear. 

“It’s time to take revenge.”


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 156 - Destruction</h1>

The ten fleets suddenly appeared all around the robot system. Three fleets appeared beside the battlestation in the middle of the system. Four appeared surrounding the robot fleet they were building. Two appeared around the huge manufacturing ships. The last one appeared around the planet the robots were mining.

As soon as the fleets appeared, fighters surged forth from the carriers at the center of each fleet. These fighters were all the shield fighters! Forming a sphere-shaped formation around the fleet, the shield fighters linked their shields together! It was impossible to attack any of the fleets without breaking through the shield that now surrounded them.

Now that the shield was in place, sniper fighters took their positions behind the battleships. With the battleships between them and the enemy, it would make the sniper drones far better protected while still giving them a mostly clear shot. The regular fighters formed up right beside the carriers, ready to charge out of the shield and engage in long-distance strikes. 

As Lucas’ fleet was preparing, the robot ships were also preparing. Unlike a human fleet, there were no signs of panic. Instead, there was an immediate response to the invading fleet. The enemy fleet had been stockpiling up in the middle of the system. It immediately formed a huge arrowhead shape pointed at one of the four enemy fleets surrounding them.

The battlestation let loose a flood of destroyers, cruisers, and battleships that formed a barrier between it and the two fleets that had appeared around it. As for the manufacturing plants…

Huge shields appeared all around the manufacturing plants. Thick barrels slowly emerged from the manufacturing ships’ surfaces. The barrels swiveled and pointed towards the two fleets that were opposite them. Finally, the transport ships that were being threatened by the single fleet nearby stopped operation and fled towards their allies.

Cold sweat broke out on Chu Shen’s brow. During their planning, Lucas had mentioned that it was possible the manufacturing plants had weapons. It was obvious they had shields, otherwise there would be no way for them to protect themselves.

However, even if they had shields, the manufacturing ships had no way of fighting back. Lucas said it was preposterous that such huge ships had no weapons. What he mentioned were things like anti-fighter armaments or maybe missiles. There was no mention of huge cannons like the ones being pointed at them now.

Lucas, on the other hand, decided that they were in the perfect position. His sniper drones would obviously have the advantage in range. His four fleets surrounding the enemy fleet would be able make quick work of them. 

Since the enemy fleet was in between the battlestation and manufacturing ships, they would be able to support both if needed. Not to mention that the support ships fleeing signified that they weren’t armed. As a result, the one fleet he sent to deal with them would also be freed up quite swiftly.

All in all, it seemed as though the two biggest wild cards were the manufacturing plants and the battlestation. The battlestation having a fleet of ships inside it wasn’t anticipated. Maybe a hundred destroyers and a handful of battleships, but the amount that came out of the battle station was equal to ten enemy fleets without the fighters and carriers. 100 battleships, 400 destroyers, and 200 cruisers! 

Compared to Lucas’ overall amount of ships, it seemed pitiful. However, with the firepower of the battlestation backing them up, it wouldn’t be too far a stretch of the imagination that Lucas’ three fleets would be destroyed.

All of this ran through Lucas’ head in a matter of seconds. The speed of his thoughts were far superior to any human’s due to his positronic brain. As a result, all of his calculations were able to come to fruition in a short amount of time.

 He ordered his fleet that was close to the fleeing transport ships to open fire. Plasma bolts quickly filled the void as the destroyers began to shoot. The shield fighters’ shields blocked everything from coming in but nothing from getting out, allowing their ships to fire through the shields protecting them. 

The transport ships were exceedingly fragile, blowing up with only a single strike. Some of them seemed like they were going to escape before a hole would mysteriously appear in the hull. Obviously, the sniper drones were finally going active.

Squads of fighters also shot out from their protective sphere, striking at some of the farthest ships before they could get clear. Soon, most of the transport ships disappeared from the system. A handful were able to get to cover, but compared to their previous numbers, they could only be called pitiful.

Railguns bombarded the surface of the planet as well, wiping out the mining tools. With this, their supply operation could be called crippled. While this was going on, the other three locations were also getting busy.

The battle station had multiple laser beams and plasma bolts flying from its multiple gun ports. Lucas’ three fleets’ shields were holding steady, easily absorbing all the punishment the battle station and their supporting fleet was dishing out. Instead, it was the enemy that was being demolished!
 The battle station’s supporting fleets were quickly being wiped out. Their shields could only withstand one blow, maybe two, from the tachyon cannon. The railguns went straight through their shields like they were nothing before hitting their hulls. 

The plasma bolts only did a little bit of damage, but there were hundreds of thousands of them flying across space. There were also the huge plasma bolts from the destroyers’ main guns. Just one hit would take down more than half a battleship’s shield. If two hit a battleship at once, then bye-bye battleship.

While the battle station and its supporting fleet was being handled pretty well, the main enemy fleet was also being crushed. The robots weren’t helpless though. They had discovered that fighters could pass through the shield fighters’ force field and were waylaying the ships inside. The fighters pitiful armaments only caused negligible damage but now the other ships in the enemy fleet were charging at them, intending to pass through the shield as well.

The biggest surprise was actually the manufacturing ships. Their huge guns that Lucas was so wary of at first hadn’t fired once. Instead they sat there like turtles, hiding behind their giant shields. So far, the battleships were the only ones to score kills, the railguns rendering their shields useless. All of the other ships pumped their fire into one manufacturing ship, but it appeared as though it was useless. Their shields were just too strong.

One of the manufacturing ships’ huge guns started glowing. The barrel lit up with an eerie red energy. Suddenly, a beam of red energy shot outwards, striking one of the two fleets’ shields.

A white explosion of energy blinded Lucas’ sensors. Just what was that?!



<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 157 - Hidden Cards</h1>

After that white beam of energy shot out, the force field generated by the shield fighters dropped to 40% power. If he was still human, Lucas would’ve undoubtedly started sweating. Such enormous power! More of the manufacturing plants were slowly maneuvering themselves around. The barrels of that huge weapon swiveled as well, attempting to lock onto Lucas’ two fleets.

That were still almost 600 manufacturing ships that could still fire their weapons! Lucas knew he needed to take immediate action. Manipulating his internal map, Lucas overclocked his positronic brain. His perception of time slowed down, giving him enough time to give orders to the ships in the fleet.

The spherical formation split apart. The shield fighters formed a square in front of them, boosting the strength of the now much smaller shield to 120% of the previous shield’s power. The other ships in the formation shot forward at their fastest speed towards the closest manufacturing ships.

The various fighters arrived first, stopping right beside the manufacturing ships’ hulls. Just like the enemy had realized, Lucas had also discovered that physical objects could penetrate force fields. The next ships that arrived were the destroyers and then the battleships. They surrounded the two chosen manufacturing plants just a couple feet away from its hull.

The other manufacturing ships locked onto the two that Lucas surrounded but hesitated to fire. Lucas ordered his ships not to fire. It was better to not force them to take action until he could bring in some reinforcements from the other locations.

At the battle station, the supporting fleet had been wiped out. One of Lucas’ fleets had suffered losses when the supporting fleet had flown through the shield fighters’ force field and started firing on the ships within. Luckily, Lucas’ ships could still activate their own individual forcefields so losses weren’t super bad. At least, they weren’t until the robots started ramming Lucas’ ships. 

Most of the kamikaze ships focused on the battleships, rightfully assuming that they were the biggest threat to them. Lucas ordered the fighters to ram the enemy ships if they came too close to a battleship, giving them a taste of their own medicine. The destroyers protecting the battleships unleashed hundreds of thousands of plasma bolts at the enemy as they charged in recklessly at the battleships, playing their part in the enemy’s destruction.

Lucas lost over ten battleships, two hundred fighters, and twelve destroyers to the supporting enemy fleet. Their suicidal charge quickly diminished their numbers, exposing themselves to fire that they normally would have tried to evade. The tactic was effective though, since they wouldn’t have been able to kill a single one of Lucas’ ships if they hadn’t charged.

The battle station had been firing at one of the three fleets surrounding it the entire time. The supporting fleet had also been firing at the same fleet. Now, its efforts came to fruition. The shield on it had been slowly weakening and was now at 10%. Due to the low power, the shield started to become spotty. Random holes would open up in the shield, causing some of the enemy fire to slip by. After another thirteen minutes, the shield failed completely.

Lucas ordered the fleet to split up and attempt to join the other fleet formations. As it did, the heavy firepower of the battle station focused on the battleships, causing enormous casualties. Out of the eighty-five battleships that survived the kamikaze attack, only twenty-three made it to the other two fleets successfully.

The battle station was also taking a beating. Holes were ripped into its thick armor and its shields were also diminishing little by little. Without its supporting fleet, the battle station could only beat on the fleets’ shields from a distance. It would take some time before the shields were diminished enough to get to the less protected ships underneath. 

Lucas also ordered the shield fighters to form a square shaped shield aimed towards the battle station. With this, the shield’s power became even stronger than before. This way, it would take longer for them to break through.

Lucas would have done so earlier, but he was worried that the enemy ships from the supporting fleet would try to outflank him on his unshielded sides. The one-sided shield was only viable if the enemies were in one direction and couldn’t outflank him. Otherwise it would only make his fleets vulnerable.

Meanwhile, the main enemy fleet had almost been wiped out by Lucas’ fleets. Just like with the supporting fleet, the main fleet charged at one of Lucas’ fleets. The fighters arrived first, then the cruisers, the destroyers, and finally the enemy battleships. 

Lasers and plasma flew everywhere as the enemy ships were practically touching his formation. Their fighters were particularly annoying since they were a lot faster than other ships and couldn’t be intercepted easily. The fighters would ram into important parts like a ship’s engines or its reactor, causing serious destruction to ensue. 

They were so fast and nimble that they were almost impossible to stop unless a destroyer focused on one fighter at a time. With their numbers, it was impossible to stop them all. What was even more annoying was that they were targeting battleships again. They managed to completely destroy one of Lucas’ fleets and half of another before the last enemy ship blew up.

With that done, Lucas started to ponder. He could either send the two and a half fleets towards the manufacturing ships or have them join the fight against the battle station. After five seconds of thinking, Lucas immediately dispatched them towards the battle station.

Currently, the manufacturing ships were not fighting him. If he sent over these reinforcements, then the fight could start up once more. If that happened, Lucas believed he would face serious consequences. It would be better to finish up the fight with the battle station and then send the rest of his fleets in and crush them in one fell swoop.

With the additional reinforcements, the battle station quickly fell. The railguns were simply too powerful. Lucas ordered his fleets to stay there as an idea suddenly occurred to him. He remembered reading in his history books about some of the major fleet battles. An Admiral Kashchiev of the UEF had been a particularly outstanding commander. One of the strategies he was known for was called Metal Rain. 

It was a strategy that was very basic. In space, there was no friction. As a result, an object in space would keep the same speed unless it was affected by the gravity of a planet. Admiral Kashchiev used this principle to the fullest. 

Filling space with thousands of railgun shells, he would bombard the enemy fleets over ten hours journey from their systems, well away from any detection systems. Unless the enemy fleet moved within that time frame, it was a guaranteed hit. Of course, tactics had advanced to the point where such a strategy was antiquated. However, maybe it was applicable in this case.

Those huge manufacturing ships were very slow moving, as showcased by how long it took for just a single one to line up its armament with one of Lucas’ fleets. They were prime targets for long range railgun bombardment. 

Ordering his ships to take aim, Lucas’ battleships fired. Hundreds of thousands of railgun shells shot outwards every second. After ten seconds of firing, the target of the bombardment would be switched. His ships continued on their course towards the manufacturing ships. It would only make them suspicious if he suddenly stopped.

Lucas smiled. Soon, the railgun shells would impact the manufacturing ships. Just what kind of havoc would they wreak?



<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 158 - Wipeout</h1>

The huge manufacturing ships floated silently through space, completely oblivious to their doom hurtling towards them. Lucas waited impatiently for the ten minutes it would take for the railgun slugs to arrive. 

Fifteen seconds before the first bombardment would arrive, something happened. Lucas’ ships that were covering the outside of the manufacturing ship disappeared. He had previously ordered them to go into hyperspace right before their bombardment time so as to avoid friendly fire. 

The enemy still didn’t know that he could use hyperspace modules inside a solar system. He could have ordered his ships to jump away from the manufacturing ships, escaping the stalemate they had previously been in. If he did that though, he had no idea what the enemy would do. Better to keep it the way he had. 

Once his ships were gone, the manufacturing ships started to rotate their guns towards Lucas’ incoming fleets. Unfortunately, they had only just started to move when one of the six-hundred plus manufacturing ships exploded! Lucas watched as one by one, the huge manufacturing ships were destroyed.

Within one minute, a total of 100 ships had been destroyed. Another 50 had been crippled in one way or another. Even more ships came under fire as they went down the list of targets. Lucas had given his fleet orders. 

Assigning each manufacturing ship a number, they would go from least to greatest, all ships focusing fire on that one ship for two seconds before switching to another ship. In this manner, an enemy ship would be severely damaged by hundreds of thousands of railgun slugs for two seconds before another would suddenly come under fire. 

One of the manufacturing ships was finally able to point its gun barrel at Lucas’ incoming fleets. A surge of brilliant white energy shot out towards his fleets. Lucas was concerned but didn’t panic. Those fleets’ shields were all at 80%. Previously, one of his fleets had taken a strike point blank and it had taken their shields down by 40%. They had more than enough energy to block that one shot. That was, of course, assuming that the energy beam actually reached them.

Lucas observed the energy beam as it shot out at half the speed of light. With such speed, it reached his fleet in a matter of seconds. The white beam had reduced to only a quarter of its original size by the time it reached his fleets. 

This was caused by attenuation, when the energy would bleed off and separate into the void of space. It was the same concept as shooting a stream of water. The water would stay together for a short distance but would eventually separate into many droplets of water. 

For this reason, energy weapons were often much stronger the closer one was. It was the same reason that the destroyers’ plasma turrets were used only for close defense. They just weren’t powerful enough to go very far.

The energy weapon hit the shield surrounding one of his fleets. It shuddered but held. Lucas looked at the energy drain. 5%. Clearly, the beam was severely weakened by the distance. Lucas let out a sigh of relief. 

Then he jolted as he realized that there were still almost 400 other manufacturing ships that could fire at his fleets. If each one could fire a single beam like that… It didn’t take a math genius to discover that his fleets would be destroyed if he didn’t think of something.

Giving panicked orders, all seven and a half-fleets suddenly started shifting and changing shape. All of the shield fighters formed a huge square in front of the fleets instead of the seven large spherical shaped shields and the one slightly smaller one. Lucas read the shield as 730% percent compared to the original shields. It would most likely be sufficient to block the enemy’s attacks. 

All of his ships formed a line behind this square shield. Now they were completely covered by all of the shield fighters. In the front of the shield were all of the destroyers, fighters, and carriers. At the very back was all the battleships. They battleships stuck to the edge of the round column shaped formation, allowing them a clear shot at the enemy.

The railgun slugs continuously surged forth, desperately seeking to eliminate some of the horrifying weapon platforms before they could destroy them. The enemy ships kept disappearing as his battleships continued to fight. The manufacturing ships continued maneuvering though, lining up their guns to fire on them.

Surges of white energy shot forth towards his fleet. They impacted his shield. At first it was only a shot or two every once in a while. However, as more and more ships were able to bring their guns to bear, it became a continuous stream of energy. Now the energy beams were destroying most of the railgun shells before they reached the manufacturing ships.

At the same time though, the enemy had slowly been destroyed. Now only three hundred ships remained. Unfortunately, none of the ships were being destroyed now that their weapon had been neutralized. Lucas realized that the shield was now only at 50%.

It was time to take drastic measures. Lucas gave orders to the ships behind the shield. They all disappeared, leaving the shield fighters behind. Instead, they appeared directly behind the manufacturing ships. Once again, the huge ships started to desperately rotate in order to bring their guns to bear.

The seven and a half fleets opened fire. Now that they were closer, the destroyers could finally be put to use. They dived for the closest manufacturing ships, passing through their shields and unleashing a storm of plasma bolts.

At the same time, several other things occurred as well. All of the carriers, which still carried their loads of sniper drones, did not jump with the other fleets. Instead they jumped even farther away. A swarm of sniper drones formed a huge formation in deep space. 

Firing their tachyon cannons, they finally revealed their awesome firepower. In a single volley, one manufacturing ship had its shields broken and its hull penetrated. Hundreds of miniature holes appeared in its hull. It suddenly exploded as one of its reactors lost containment.

The two fleets that Lucas had jump away before the initial bombardment had also not been idle. They had started firing their own railguns and their first volley was finally arriving. Ship after ship exploded. Their four hundred ships started to slowly dwindle.

Soon, there was nothing left except the empty husks of ships, floating through the void of space. Lucas smiled darkly as he observed the metallic corpses of his foes. Recalling what Chu Shen had once said, Lucas realized just how true it was.

If one has strength, but cannot even touch their foes, what is use of that power? If one has strong defense, but cannot flee from the fights, what was the point? Only if one has speed can one be called king. For with speed, one can strike when wanted, and flee when one wanted as well.

This fight perfectly demonstrated that fact. Those huge ships had such powerful weapons, but they weren’t able to bring them to bear. With that, they were just paper tigers. They looked threatening but weren’t able to do anything in the end.

Lucas smiled grimly. At least, he was able to put that alien to rest with the corpses of his creations. 


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 159 - Rewards</h1>

Lucas stopped by the jellyfish planet, informing them of their creations’ destruction. They thanked Lucas multiple times until he finally got fed up with it and left. Arriving back at the Nugitraaiilian planet, Lucas took his ship back to the surface.

Aslo, Chu Shen, Chrissa, and Lucas all exited the ship after it landed. Facing them was a mech. There was a flash of light and suddenly, hundreds of thousands of mechs were now in front of them. Lucas backed up, his hands in the air. “What do you think you’re doing? We are supposed to be working together.”

One of the mechs stepped forward. “We have ended the threat to our planet posed by the invaders. Due to that, pre-war measurements are now in place. No war vessels greater in number than fifty are permitted to be under the command of one person or entity. No fighters greater than the number of two hundred are permitted to be under the command of one person or entity. Any persons that violate these laws will be accused of attempted treason and executed.”

Aslo immediately became outraged. “You can’t be serious. We just saved this entire planet! Show some gratitude at least.” 

Lucas grabbed his shoulder. “Aslo!” He hissed in Aslo’s ear. “That won’t work. He’s a robot, only logic will work on him.” Turning to face the mech, Lucas started thinking. “AI, we did not know of this law previously, so forgive our ignorance. In order to meet your requirements, may we be allowed to self-destruct our ships until they are at the designated number?”


The mech nodded. “This is permitted, but it must be carried out within the next hour or you will be accused of treason.”

All of the mechs surrounding them disappeared. All that was left was a single scout drone. Lucas started issuing orders. All of his ships except 40 destroyers, 10 battleships, 100 shield fighters, 30 fighters, and 70 sniper drones immediately deactivated their reactor containment systems. Overhauling their engines, they soon became beautiful fireworks in the darkness of space.

After the last extra ship disappeared, the scout drone approached them. “Now that you are no longer being accused of treason, your privateer payments are no longer suspended. The major contributions you have accomplished is not covered in the Sh’lteek protocol.

“Military accomplishments shall be paid in cores to the person or nearest of kin. Due to your unprecedented accomplishments, all cores available in the warehouses shall be paid to your privateer group. The payment will be given once the other privateers have been paid.”

Lucas looked confused. “I thought there were no privateers except us.”

The scout drone replied matter-of-factly. “All other privateers have passed away in the line of duty. I am currently searching for their closest relatives.” Lucas finally realized what that meant. The privateers the scout drone mentioned were obviously the privateers that had defended the Nugitraaiil against the first alien invasion. All of them were already dead or evacuated.

Lucas sighed. “Thank you. Please let us know when the distribution is over so that we can take our share.”

“It will be as you instructed, Privateer.”

While the rest went to eat, Lucas started to dismantle the ARD and the fabricators. There was no point in letting the AI study them. He didn’t want to cause an upset in the power balance of the world. Plus, you could never fully trust a robot. Give it a convincing argument and it would kill its own creator.

Thirty minutes later, the scout drone appeared in front of Lucas. “I have finished scanning the planet. No one eligible to receive a reward was detected. Because of this, their reward defaults back to the military. Your reward is now available. Would you like to see it now?”

Lucas set down the quantum stabilizer. “Yeah, just let me get my crew together first.”

Soon, the whole gang was following the scout drone. They were slowly walking towards the city. Finally, Lucas got annoyed and called his spaceship down. Boarding it along with everyone else, he had the robot point out where to land the ship at. Soon they were at the Planetary Command Center. 

Once there, the scout drone guided them to a heavily fortified section of the base. There, they found an elevator that was supposed to take them to the bottom of a fortified bunker. Unfortunately, due to the power usage, the elevator was out of operation.

Instead, Lucas flew down with his jetpack while holding the scout drone. Chu Shen used his <Stars Dance: Light Step> to create a walkway down. Aslo created a stream of fire from his palms, slowing his fall. Chrissa created a miniature hurricane under herself, floating down to the floor.

At the bottom of the shaft was a pair of closed doors. Chu Shen brought out his hammer and started using his <Song of the Universe: Solar Vibrations> to vibrate his hammer as he coated it in null Qi. With as fierce a swing as he could muster in the cramped environment of the elevator shaft, Chu Shen smashed his hammer against the doors. With a BANG, the closed elevator doors blew apart.

Peering through the gaping hole, Chu Shen could see a small open room. Walking into the room, he saw many doors leading away from it with signs on each door. Going over to one of the doors, he opened it. There was a large warehouse filled with many small metal boxes. They were painted different colors with the most common being green and blue while the least common was red and purple.

The scout drone walked through the door Chu Shen opened. Going over to one of the purple boxes, the scout drone easily took it off the shelf it was on. “This contains twenty J’Tik cores. There are ten more purple boxes with J’Tik cores in the warehouse. The forty red boxes contain H’Tik cores, the two hundred green boxes contain G’Tik cores. Finally, the nine hundred red boxes contain F’Tik cores. Each box contains twenty cores.”

Chu Shen got closer to the box of J’Tik cores. He gasped as he felt the immense energy coming from the box. Master Ti Wu floated out from the Void’s Hand. Upon seeing the cores, he was stunned. “You brat! Where did you get such insane luck! These are Emperor Beast Cores, Level seven if I’m not mistaken.”

Chu Shen backed away quickly, tripping over himself in his haste and falling on the floor. “W-w-what? Emperor Beast Cores? These are Emperor Beast Cores!”

Emperor. The pinnacle of the martial realm. When one reached it, they would be elders in any sect they wished. To think that there were four hundred Martial Emperor Beast Cores in this warehouse. 

They were all his.

If he managed to absorb these, then… He didn’t dare imagine how far he would advance in cultivation. Chu Shen grinned. “I think it’s time for an upgrade.”


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 160 - Cultivation Again</h1>

After transporting all the crystals out of the warehouse, it was decided that Chu Shen would take some to cultivate. Taking what he needed, Chu Shen quickly left and started closed door cultivation. Absorbing energy from the Emperor and King Stage Beast Cores, Chu Shen advanced quickly through his cultivation.

In a month, Chu Shen had reached the Martial Emperor Stage from the Martial Army Stage, two full stages! Another month passed by and Chu Shen reached the Martial Emperor Stage Level 6. Apparently, when one reached the Martial Emperor Stage, the body would be purged of almost all impurities. As a result, there would only be five blockages inside the final two meridians which resulted in the Emperor stage being separated into two meridians. Because of how concentrated it was though, it became ten times as difficult to break through.

It took Chu Shen another month to finally reach Martial Emperor Stage Level 10. Master Ti Wu had told him to stop there. Anything further and he would need to have Master Ti Wu guide him.

Finally, it was time to break into the Natural Realm. Taking the first step, Chu Shen called out to Master Ti Wu, who emerged from the Void’s Hand. Surveying Chu Shen, Master Ti Wu nodded. “You’ve finally reached the peak of the Martial Emperor Stage. It took you long enough. Alright, now it’s time for you to reach the Earth Stage.”

“A normal person's body would have been refining its Qi for a while now, gradually getting closer to realizing their element. When one reaches the Emperor Stage, traces of that element would be realized inside the person’s Qi. For example, a person at Martial Emperor Level 8 might be able to cause burns with his Qi if he had the fire element.”

“Unfortunately, everyone around you is a freak. None of them had to go through this process. Normally a person would start to reject normal Qi and by the time they reached Martial Emperor Level 9, they would be unable to absorb Qi that is not related to their element. Fortunately, your element still lets you do that, you lucky brat.”

“In order to advance to the Natural Realm, one must solidify their dantian. Absorb Qi into your dantian, as much as possible to the point of bursting. Don’t stop until it becomes painful. Then, condense! Condense the Qi as much as possible using the pressure from your meridians. You should be somewhat familiar with this process since Martial Warriors turn their Qi into liquid.”

Chu Shen nodded. He had condensed his Qi before, though his meridians had condensed it for him, so it had become a thoughtless process since then. Concentrating, Chu Shen started to absorb Qi and force it into his dantian. Soon, his dantian was overflowing with Qi. He felt a pinching sensation in his gut, making him uncomfortable.

Taking this as a sign that his dantian was finally full, Chu Shen started to condense his Qi. Using the pressure from the Qi his meridians absorbed, he forced his Qi to shrink inside his dantian. The liquid swirled and surged. All of his liquid Qi slowly disappeared. In its place was a small shining bead of solid Qi. This Qi wasn’t the color of gray null Qi. Instead, it was a black Qi.

Chu Shen was puzzled and sent his soul out to investigate this. An aura that reminded Chu Shen of Master Ti Wu emanated from that Qi. Master Ti Wu grinned as he sent out his own spiritual sense.

“Alright brat. You now have your first elemental Qi, proper Null Qi. This Qi is highly condensed and purified Qi. Once you are able to form it, it signifies that you are now in the Natural Realm. Unlike before, stages are not separated into 10 levels, since there isn’t a clear distinction. Now, let me tell you what the Earth, Nature, and World Stages are.”

“Earth stage is the stage where one can form elemental Qi. Your body will reject all forms of Qi unless it is pure elemental Qi, which means your meridians will no longer absorb Qi from the atmosphere.”

“Nature Stage is where one begins to absorb minute traces of their element from the atmosphere. Usually this breakthrough is only considered a minor one since it doesn’t increase your strength, but it greatly increases stamina since one can now absorb Qi everywhere, and not just in places with pure elements. Since your Qi allows you to absorb all energy, you can be considered to already be in the Nature Stage. 

“Finally, there is the World Stage. In this stage, one forms their domain. Domain is simply where one unleashes their elemental Qi and creates an area where their element reigns supreme. The power of a domain comes from the amount of the martial artist’s Qi and their understanding of their element.

“One might ask what that means. If a martial artist can understand their element and where its power comes from, they would be able to enhance it. For example, take a martial artist with the fire element. Chu Shen, you understand that fire is the result of combustion due to Lucas’ universe. By adding oxygen, one can increase the might of the combustion reaction. 

If that martial artist knew that, he could use his Qi to increase airflow into his domain and strengthen it. Various other laws of nature can be used to increase the might of a domain. One martial artist I knew of had a sword domain. He would throw out dozens of swords and strengthen his domain that way. As for you, you must first create your domain and then we can strengthen it.”

Chu Shen nodded. “Thank you master Ti Wu. Now, do you think I can help Aslo an Chrissa with their breakthroughs as well?”

Master Ti Wu paused. He thought for a bit before nodding. “Yes, they should also be able to break through to the Nature Stage like you. They have already been filtering Qi from the atmosphere all their lives, so it should come easy. Just make sure they can condense elemental Qi.”

Chu Shen nodded. “Thank you Master Ti Wu.”

Going to Aslo and Chrissa, Chu Shen told them he would help them train to Rank 9 Mages and even beyond that. Immediately, they became super excited. Chrissa decided that Aslo should receive the training first and she would be last.

Once it was settled, Chu Shen took Aslo to his hut and was ready to begin training. Right as they were about to start, a translucent barrier appeared around them. Chu Shen sighed. “Sorry Aslo, we’ll have to train in the next dimension.”


Aslo frowned. “So I have to wait ‘till then? Great. Just great.”

Lucas sighed as well. “At least I was able to finish creating this mech with the help of the AI. Maybe I’ll get to test it out in the next dimension.” A twelve-foot tall suit of armor disappeared from in front of Lucas as he spoke.

The ships that Lucas had kept suddenly exploded as their reactors lost containment. Sending a message to the AI, he said that they were leaving. Not even a second after he sent the message, Lucas, and everyone else, disappeared from the planet.
