<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 71 - No Charms?!</h1>
 
Chu Shen appeared inside the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion exactly where he left off at. Looking around nothing had changed. A small gasp sounded behind him. Spinning around what he saw stunned him.
Lucas was looking around with a shocked expression on his face. “What the heck just happened?!!”
‘Great you brat. Now this mortal is inside the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. What to do, what to do.’
Chu Shen shook his head as master Ti Wu remarked sarcastically in his head. “Lucas, listen okay? I can explain everything.”
Lucas immediately focused on him, a desperate look on his face. “Alright, i’m listening.”
“It’s like this, I am from a different dimension. In this dimension the strong are prey to the weak. People can control energy with their souls and strengthen their body beyond belief. My mom was captured because of me being too weak so I must get strong to rescue her.”
“I accidentally hitched a ride on this object that travels to different dimensions which is why I ended up in yours. The bracelet I gave you teleports whoever wears it into this place. As for where we will end up I don’t know.”
At least that was the gist of what he said. Lucas constantly interrupted him with questions about this and that. He cried with him after he talked about his mother being kidnapped and laughed in joy after finding out his parents were safe.
After a while Lucas just sat there, trying to absorb everything that he had just been told. Finally he got up.
“Alright Chu Shen, since you have that bracelet thing I should be able to at least go back right.” Chu Shen started to nod at that before he suddenly froze.
“Whats with that face? I can go back right?” Lucas asked worried.
Chu Shen looked at him sheepishly for a second. “Ah, well about that……. I never really used the charm. “
“..........”
“.........”
“WHAT!! I CAN’T GO BACK!!!! Agh, my life is over, overrr!!!” Lucas crumpled up in a ball in despair.
Chu Shen hurriedly went over to comfort Lucas. “Hold on, it’s not that bad! In five years the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion should come back to your dimension. All you have to do is wear the bracelet and survive until then.”
“Yeah, not that bad.” Lucas said sarcasm dripping from his voice. He leaned back and looked up at the ceiling in a wistful look. “I bet Xentus is going out of his mind trying to find us.”
He sighed, remembering his adoptive father. Chu Shen sighed as well, recalling the kindness Xentus showed him.
After a while, Lucas got up. “In order to survive I need a couple things. I need a power source, I am a cyborg after all.”
Chu Shen nodded. “Alright, can you open up your parts? I think I might know a way.”
Lucas’ took off his shirt. Underneath his skin split before sliding to the side, revealing the intricate machinery underneath. Chu Shen looked at it before he pulled out a beast core from his spatial ring.
Unplugging a wire from one of the power cells he had Lucas lay down on the floor. Pulling out an inscription tablet used to practice inscriptions he got busy.
Using some inscription ink meant for the [Channeling Inscription] he quickly modified it to transfer Qi between the beast core and the wire.
The reason he chose this beast core was because it was from the land eel, a lightning type beast. Unlike cultivators beasts have innate elemental powers but they can’t unleash its full potential until they also unblock their meridians.
The modified inscription flashed gold before the inscription ink turned into ash. Sighing Chu Shen tried again. After twenty or so tries the inscription flashed gold and the inscription ink turned golden as well.
Chu Shen wiped sweat from his brow. Truly, modifying inscriptions, even the most simple ones, was very taxing on the mind. This entire time he had already explained to Lucas what he was trying to do. Understanding, Lucas merely watched him, his eyes flashing with curiosity.
Preparing himself he put the wire on the receiving end of the inscription and the beast core on the other. Inputting Qi, he activated the inscription. Silver blue energy coursed through the inscription where it was absorbed into the wire.
Lucas, who was watching his internal HUD, showed a shocked face. He was at about 81% power but now there was an increase in .1%! While this may not seem big, his powercell could power him for over ten years in normal usage and nine months in constant combat.
With this, he didn’t have to worry about recharging. Lucas immediately communicated this to Chu Shen. Both of them rejoiced in this newfound idea.
“So I know this whole thing about being strong is very big in your dimension. But can I really be killed so easily?” Lucas had a hard time believing that.
“Imagine if someone can destroy a city with a wave of his hand, if you offended him he might kill you over something as simple as looking at him the wrong way.” Chu Shen explained quite clearly the rules of his dimension.
“Most places are ruled by a dominant organization with important people being in charge of cities. Face, or pride, is very important to these proud people so if you offend them they might kill or cripple you to regain their pride.”
Lucas thought for a little bit before realizing, this was like corrupt officials in his own dimension! If you offended a wealthy businessman they could bribe a judge to put you in jail. In a world where human life is not as precious as his own, then instead of jail time it would be his life that was bought.
As Chu Shen put up the now drained beast core, a translucent barrier appeared around him and Lucas. The entire place started crumbling with the stones whistling through the air, creating a loud ruckus.
“IS THIS THE TELEPORTATION EFFECT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT CHU SHEN?!”  Lucas yelled.
“YES IT IS. IT SHOULD BE OVER SOON.” He yelled back.
As the pagodas formed like last time, Lucas stared openmouthed in awe at the wondrous sight. The gray vortex appeared around them.
Then they disappeared.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 72 - Ah! My Leg!</h1>
 
Chu Shen and Lucas appeared suddenly on a beautiful mountain with other mountains surrounding it. While the mountain was large and greenery abounded everywhere, they were at the very top where only desolate rock was around until you went further down the mountain.
Directly in front of them was a man in dire straits. He wore a robe that though tattered exuded the appearance of nobility. It had holes and burn marks on it, revealing the tarnished metal armor underneath.
The man was facing away from them, looking down the mountain side. “I finally lost them. Thank God, I can finally rest now……” He suddenly stiffened as though he sensed something.
Turning around he saw Chu Shen and Lucas staring at him.
“.........”
“........”
“He doesn’t seem that scary Chu Shen.” Lucas spoke up, breaking the awkward silence. Immediately like a cat that had its tail stepped on, the man jumped backwards, floating in the air.
“I don’t know how you got here without me finding out, but you will never get the Yin-Yang gloves.” Immediately a black glove appeared around his right hand and a white glove around his left hand.
He punched his two fists together and as they drew apart a Yin-Yang symbol in the shape of a ball appeared growing bigger and bigger.
Chu Shen immediately recognized the danger. “Lucas, get away, NOW!” Circulating his qi, a shield appeared in the air between them. It was circular and had chinese script on it.
Lucas didn’t react very fast. At least, not until his HUD lit up with warnings of a massive power surge. Immediately he activated his shields and tried to run away.
“Hey hey! Why are you trying to kill us all of a sudden! We were just out going for a walk and suddenly you attack us! What gives!” Lucas yelled out.
“Hah! Like I would believe such gilded words! Take the first cycle of yin-yang you scum!” The man yelled.
Chu Shen manipulated the shield to be in between Lucas and the man. He himself released a gray energy around him, coating himself in Qi like all those in the martial realm can do.
The man released the yin-yang ball which by now was twice the size of a man. The ball flew forward and hit the shield Chu Shen constructed. It passed through without even slowing down, though it did reduce in size slightly.
The ball quickly flew towards Lucas. As he saw it coming he tried to dodge by jumping into the air but unfortunately this ball was as fast as lightning! It hit Lucas destroying his forcefield and incinerating his leg.
The man frowned at this. If they were truly trying to capture him then they would have brought someone more powerful. “Why would they seek me out with such weak strength.” He murmured. Then he saw something that stunned him.
Lucas fell to the ground and grabbed at his stump of a leg. “Ahhh! You b*stard! Do you know how long it’s going to take to make a new leg huh! Not to mention I don’t even know if I can make a new one in these conditions!”
Sparks came out of his leg and bits of metal dangled out of it. The man’s jaw dropped at the sigh. Pointing at Lucas’ leg he stuttered. “W-wh-what the hell is that!”
Lucas got up and started hopping to keep his balance. “This! This is my leg you b*stard! You can’t even recognize what you chopped off?! B*stard!”
Chu Shen on the other hand was trying to sneak around the mountain to Lucas. Seeing his chance since the man was stunned, he ran up to Lucas and grabbed him.
He hauled Lucas behind him, making Lucas flutter in the wind looking like a kite. Turning over his shoulder he yelled at the man while he ran. “Sorry for scaring you! Hope you don’t take offense!”
Turning to Lucas, Chu Shen asked a question. “Hey Lucas, you have any flight systems?”
Lucas’ eyes immediately lit up. “Of course I do. Man I should have thought of that. Hey Chu Shen, put me down.”
Meanwhile the man was flustered. It seemed like these kids were truly just taking a walk when he tried to kill them. He thought it might have been one of those greedy cultivators disguising themselves to make him hesitate.
He sighed.
He had been chased for over a week by greed cultivators trying to steal the Yin-Yang gloves, which left him kind of jumpy. Now that he was thinking clearly, he could sense the energy in these kids dantians. They weren’t a threat, they were barely even close to his level. ‘I was definitely in the wrong.’
After Lucas was set down he leaned on Chu Shen for support. Out of his back emerged a gray cylinder with a blunt tapered end facing towards the ground. Lucas grabbed Chu Shen tight. “Hey man, hold on okay, I’m about to take off!”
Chu Shen nodded. “Alright Lucas, let’s go.”
Immediately a whine was heard slowly powering up the flight system. A blue glow appeared underneath the cylinders bottom. While they were prepping for take-off the man still stood there stunned.
Finally he called out to them. “Sorry about the mix-up! If you ever pass by Wildent then go to the Black Night Sect and show them this. I will make up for this.” He threw a small token at Chu Shen who caught it out of reflex.
The man became covered in a white colored energy and flew up into the air, away from direction he was looking at when they first saw him. Chu Shen grinned. “Alright, we will!”
Suddenly Lucas shot up into the air. “AHHHHHH.” Chu Shen yelled out as he flew upwards. His cheeks were flapping from the wind making him look like a fish gasping for breath. Covering himself Qi, he counteracted the windsheer.
Lucas started yelling over the sound of air whistling past his ear.“OH YEAH, WE’RE TAKING OFF!”
“I HATE YOU LUUUUCAAAAAAASSSSSSS!!!!!!”
“HAHAHAHAHA”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 73 - Money</h1>

Lucas and Chu Shen landed after a little over fifteen minutes of flight. Lucas used his cybernetic eyes to scan for a nearby town which was almost thirty miles away. They got close before landing so that they could avoid being spotted.
They also wrapped a strip of torn cloth around Lucas’ leg and Chu Shen chopped a tree branch in the shape of a walking stick for him using a short sword from his spatial ring.
Soon they got into town. After exploring for a bit Chu Shen made a judgement. This realm was almost exactly his own, except for minor differences in technique.
Chu Shen had discussed with Lucas exactly what they were going to do when they got into town. However things did not go like Chu Shen planned for them too…………
It was to be expected honestly, Chu Shen should have seen this coming. Their original plan called for them to rent a room and buy some metal. With that Lucas could make a crude prosthetic using the fabber.
However Chu Shen forgot something very important which I am sure you know by now.
Money.
Yep, money. Who actually believes there is a universal currency much less inter-dimensional currency? Maybe the currency that can be traded with everyone would be goods but Chu Shen didn’t have any.
Of course he was an artificer but he only had inscription ink and some beast cores. He also had some scrap weapons but no one wanted them. This was a pretty nice town and to sell something that only a low level apprentice could make was apparently a pipe dream.
So Chu Shen and Lucas finally gave up. Now both of them were sitting down next to the stone wall that surrounded the city.
“So Chu Shen, do we have a plan as to what we should do next?” Lucas asked.
Chu Shen sighed. “Earning money is hard. But we might be able to hunt some of the beasts around here.”
Lucas got up. “Alright let’s go then, come on!” He enthusiastically cheered Chu Shen on. Sighing once more Chu Shen got up.
“Fine, I heard there are class 3 beasts on the south side of the village. A class 3 beast is comparable to a Dragon Stage cultivator so we should be able to earn some money quickly. It’s starting to get dark out so we should hurry.”
They immediately set out for the south side.
Once there they encountered their first class 3 beast, which was actually familiar with Chu Shen. Surrounding the beast stealthily Chu Shen whispered to Lucas the information he knew about this beast.
“Lucas, this is a class 3 beast called Shadow Fox. From what I remember from my world it can cloak itself in shadow making it invisible. It’s also fast and aggressive but will run away if it realizes its in danger.”
Lucas grinned. “Alright then. I don’t have a combat HUD exactly but I do have a tracking program meant for analysis in the lab. It should be a piece of cake.” His hand split apart and changed to become a plasma welder.
Chu Shen shook his head. Well, it was time to see exactly how Lucas kept up with him. Taking his living steel hammer he recalled the fact that he still hadn’t upgraded it yet. Grimacing he took out the crossbow that he had also neglected to update.
Then they attacked.
Chu Shen came out first, simply walking out and standing in front of the fox. The fox immediately perked up and looked at him. Suddenly it vanished, seeming to meld with the long shadows cast by the descending sun.
Lucas quickly appeared behind the fox, so fast it was a blur to Chu Shen even with only one leg. The plasma welder lit up a bright blue, slashing at a seemingly empty spot in the grass.
Yelp
The fox immediately cried out in pain as its back was struck with searing hot plasma, ripping through the fox’s spine. Lucas winced as well, seeing the plot of the animal.
Shaking his head he looked away from the fox while Chu Shen came up with the short sword and stabbed the disabled fox in the back of its neck. It’s pelt was worth some money along with the beast core though not very much.
Lucas looked at Chu Shen for a second but looked away again. “Ugh. That was awful. I mean, how could you kill a poor beast like that. It wasn’t doing anything wrong.” None of his previous enthusiasm was apparent.
Chu Shen looked at him strangely. “It’s simple, we need the money to get food and a place to sleep. Besides, did you forget about that man who tried to kill us for being in the wrong place?”
“Life is cheap here. Try your best to survive otherwise you may just be left behind, buried under a nameless tombstone.” Chu Shen left Lucas with those cold words and left to find more foxes. Those were actually words that his father had told him before when he was training.
Using his hammer he swiftly and efficiently crushed the heads of the foxes, avoiding the chest where the beast core was located. Without Lucas to spot the foxes sneaking ability it became harder however not impossible.
The foxes could not get past his body shield though, as the ability to coat the body in Qi was called by cultivators who reach the martial realm. He simply waited until they attacked before swiftly smashing their head in once they revealed themselves.
Foxes, compared to other level 3 beasts were not very strong. Not to mention that Lucas was a very advanced cyborg while Chu Shen was a martial student. Comparing their power levels to the foxes, they truly were like normal beasts that were being sent to the slaughter.
Eventually Lucas came back and joined him in hunting the foxes, though he was still slightly squeamish. Seemingly to apologize for his previous breakdown he vigorously hunted down the foxes with him.
Soon there was over twenty foxes that had been slain. Gathering them all Chu Shen left the beast cores inside the foxes since it might damage it’s fur to remove it. Better to leave it to the experts.
The two most expensive things on the fox was it’s fur, which was a pretty black and orange color, along with it’s beast core. Bringing it back, Chu Shen was able to find a small shop that bought the foxes, giving him a silver for each fox. Counting it up he nodded.
A room at the inn costs ten silver and a meal costs two. With it, they could have a nice rest. Together, Lucas and Chu Shen headed for the nearby inn and rented a room to share. While Chu Shen ate a small dinner, Lucas went up to the room to power down.
After all, Lucas was a cyborg and only needed power though he could enjoy food. Chu Shen on the other hand needed food to survive. Considering their small amount of money, Lucas decided to forego eating for now.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 74 - Need a hand?</h1>
 
Chu Shen sat up in bed. “Awwwnnn.” His mouth opened wide as he let out a big yawn and stretched. Looking over he saw Lucas still slumped over in the chair from when he shut down earlier.
Getting up he poked Lucas in the shoulder. He jolted upwards, just like a real human that had been startled awake. ‘The wake-up cycle must be very short.’
Mentioning this to Lucas he quickly shot down Chu Shen’s idea. What he did was not a complete shut-down, more like a power saver mode that induced sleep, so there was never a wake-up cycle.
Chu Shen ate breakfast and very swiftly they left to hunt for some more animals. This time they upgraded to a class 4 beast. Now it was more of a challenge.
This beast was called Scorching Horned Rabbit. Like the Shadow Fox it was weaker than most other class 4 beasts because of its nature. However it was still aggressive and could shoot fireballs and cover itself in a fire Qi body shield.
Lucas and Chu Shen started hunting and found the Scorching Horned Rabbit.
It was a rabbit with a horn on its head ending in a lethal point. They used the same method as the Shadow Fox with Chu Shen distracting the rabbit and Lucas attacking it from behind.
When Chu Shen stepped out the rabbit perked up and looked up at him. A red colored Qi covered the rabbit’s skin. It’s horn also glowed a bright red instead of its pure white from before. It studied Chu Shen for a second. Chu Shen waved his hand in a hello gesture.
Upon the signal Lucas charged out to kill the rabbit. It had started to run towards Chu Shen whenever it must have sensed Lucas. Swinging its head backwards a fireball formed at the tip of its horn and shot towards Lucas.
Not expecting this move, Lucas wasn’t able to dodge it. When the fireball impacted Lucas it burnt through his clothes and left a small burn mark on his synthetic skin.
Bang
Of course since his skin was fake, even though it looked completely real, it wouldn’t burn. However, when the fireball hit him it also made a small explosion, launching him backwards into a tree.
It immediately jumped towards Chu Shen with its horn pointed forward, an ominous red glow gathering on its horn. He jumped sideways to dodge the charge. Chu Shen, not giving the rabbit time to launch its fireball, immediately used his crossbow.
Hisss
It streaked through the air and hit the rabbit in its flank, though its body shield blocked it with a flare of red energy. It still succeeded in knocking the rabbit backwards.
Chu Shen immediately charged forwards swinging his hammer with both hands in an overhand swing. The rabbit jumped upwards, over his swing. It started to form a fireball on its horn but luckily his hammer was still in its weightless form.
Chu Shen swung his hammer upwards and smacked it in the chest. The blow immediately broke its body shield and flung the poor rabbit upwards. This strike dealt heavy damage to the rabbit but not a lethal one.
Lucas had by now gotten up, his face twisted in anger. “I don’t care if you are peter cottontail. But if you hit me with a fireball, you’re dead rabbit!” Immediately he activated the plasma welder and ran up to the rabbit. Waiting for it to land, he immediately slashed at it, cutting it’s head off.
Chu Shen nodded. There was no hesitation at all in killing animals now. Going onwards they killed about fifty of the rabbits before noon. If it wasn’t for Lucas’ tracking system, they never would have found the rabbits.
With it, they could hunt large number of rabbits unlike those poor hunters who had to depend upon tracking or luck to bag a beast like this. Using his storage ring, Chu Shen came back to town for lunch.
Afterwards they sold the corpses of the bunnies at several different stores, at each one they only sold ten. With that people would be less suspicious. Since the Scorching Horned Bunny was a class 4 beast he received slightly more more at a silver and 20 coppers, with 100 coppers being equal to a silver.
With this they now had sixty silver added with the six silver left over from dinner and breakfast. Finally Chu Shen thought it was time to visit the local blacksmith. He brought Lucas inside who just wandered around looking at the various items.
He himself browsed the shelves but he didn’t find what he was looking for. Going up the counter he called out to the cashier. “Uh excuse me. Could you help me find some metal ore?”
The cashier looked at him blankly. “Uh, you do realize kid that this is a blacksmith shop? We sell weapons not metal.”
Chu Shen grinned sheepishly. “Okay, can you tell me where I can get some then?”
The cashier shook her head. “Fine. There is some over in the Four Materials Shop, it specializes in selling materials to crafters so there should be some over there.”
Chu Shen nodded and immediately headed over to the Four Materials Shop. Inside there was several sections separated by symbols. There was an ink bottle and pen, a hammer, a sword, and a plant. Obviously the symbols meant inscriptions, smithing, cultivating resources, and alchemists respectively.
Chu Shen immediately headed to the smithing section. Inside there was a list of ores with samples in front of each label. There was also purity listed as well going from one star to five star.
He browsed the different types of ore before finding the best ones at a three star purity. It was called black iron, durable but cheap at 1 silver for two pounds. There was also Lightning Steel, steel that was saturated with lightning Qi at forty silver a pound.
Calculating in his head, Lucas helped him make some suggestions as well. Finally they decided. Eight pounds of black iron and one pound of lightning steel totalling forty four silver, bringing their total down to twenty two silver.
As for what to do now, Chu Shen had no idea. Going up to the counter he decided to ask the employee. “Um, excuse me. I wanted to buy some metal, how can I do that exactly?”
“Okay kid, tell me the amount, purity, and name of the material and I will bring it out for you. Then you can inspect and pay for it here.” Chu Shen nodded.
“Alright, can I have eight pounds of black iron and one pound of lightning steel at three star purity.”
“Give me a moment and I will be right out.” Soon she was back out with a package. A small square of silver metal was inside and a slightly large square of black metal.
Chu Shen frowned. Obviously black iron was heavy, resulting in this low amount of black iron. Deciding immediately it would not be enough, he bought another ten pounds, bringing his money down to 17 silver.
Leaving the shop Lucas and Chu Shen left immediately for the hotel. Once there he brought out the fabber. It was time to replace Lucas’ leg.
Lucas grinned. “Well I might not need a hand, but can you give me a leg?”
“........”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 75 - I Like Your Friends</h1>

Ignoring Lucas’ lame attempt at a joke, Chu Shen had Lucas take over the fabber. After all Lucas knew what would be most compatible with his body.
Bringing up some prosthetic designs, he quickly modified them to fit his destroyed leg. He also left out the battery, deciding to hook it up to himself.
Finally it was time.
Pulling out the materials, Lucas loaded them into the fabber. With a whir, the fabber booted up its internal systems.
The fabber was separated into three parts. The first was the processor. Here it broke down any materials placed inside and then separated the materials. Then came the preparation center.
Here the materials were prepared. By that, it meant mixing different materials together to get the proper ratio. Sometimes compound materials were needed to make a product so synthesizing the materials together was done inside the fabber.
This time there was nothing that needed to be synthesized so there was minimal preparation needed. The last part was the laser printer. Using the laser printer, or rather the gravity-modulator, the materials would be easily manipulated into shape and bonded together at an atomic level.
The fabber itself was the size of two phone booths laying side by side on the ground. Half was filled with machinery and the other only a frame with a clear material around it.
As the construction of the prosthetic advanced to the laser printer a beam of red light shot out from the frame and hit the floor. It was a laser scanner that took measurements to an atomic scale, coincidentally it was what gave the laser printer its name.
The air seemed to warp slightly in the area as a black sheen tinted with silver shot out of the skeletal frames. With visible speed the prosthetic appeared, just like someone was removing an invisible curtain.
After less than two minutes, the prosthetic was done. Pressing a button on the side, Lucas opened up the laser printer. Grabbing his prosthetic he held it up with an evil grin on his face.
“Haha! I can finally get back my leg! I was slowed down by so much since I lost it!” He sat down on the bed and immediately unwrapped the fake bandage around his leg.
Holding up the stump to his leg, a silver liquid dripped out and attacked itself to the prosthetic. Grabbing some left-over materials from the waste tray of the fabber, he held it up to his leg. The silver liquid engulfed the black iron and lightning steel.
The silver liquid surrounded the small seam between the prosthetic and his ‘real’ leg, obscuring it from view. Reaching his hand down, Lucas put his hand right below the silver liquid. It slipped down and formed several silver pill like objects. The prosthetic was now seamlessly attached to his leg.
Lucas brought his hand up to his mouth and swallowed the silver pills. Chu Shen watched this with idle curiosity. If it had been anyone else they would have been freaked out. However, he had been with Lucas for a month previously and he knew exactly what that silver liquid was.
It was Lucas’ repair system. Nanites. Microscopic robots that could repair his systems. Of course, the nanites needed materials in order to repair the systems which was why he needed the black iron and lightning steel. He also ate the nanites afterwards to recycle them.
Lucas could have also just eaten the materials but to make the prosthetic would have taken a lot longer. So it was better to use the fabber instead. After all, it was specifically designed to create things unlike his nanites which were meant for general repair.
Lucas stood up on his leg. Testing it out gently at first and then harder, he ran around the room in a blur, making a miniature hurricane. “Hehe. It works! I have my legs back!”
He looked at Chu Shen with a large foolish grin on his face, while Chu Shen smiled back. “So now that you are back in full capabilities, let's go.”
They could continue hunting around here but eventually they would kill all of the prey from overhunting. So instead they were planning on leaving for a mercenary town by edge of the beast forest.
The beast forests were a stretch of forest inhabited by primordial beasts. Typically when a beast reaches class 9 or 10 it becomes sentient. Or at least, capable of thinking of the bigger picture and communicating.
Beast forests are typically ruled by a class 12-13 beast. Usually these beasts would come to agreement with the surrounding nations. Humans would be allowed into the beast forest but if they died they would not pursue the beasts inside.
It was mutually beneficial because the beasts would become stronger after fighting to the death with humans. At the same time humans would also become stronger after fighting plus they could harvest the beast cores. Not to mention that it culled out the weaker members of beasts.
It was only natural to the beasts that those inferior creatures be culled from the herd. However, the average level of beasts inside the beast forest was typically stages 5-9 with the center of the forest being stronger monsters.
Chu Shen discovered that mercenaries would often hunt inside the forests to gather beast cores. As a result, towns sprung up around the forests. These towns were called mercenary towns. All of this Chu Shen found out after buying an info book for 1 silver bringing their money total to 16 silver.
It was cheap because of how common it was. Only general information was available, along with a basic road map. Studying this Chu Shen found out the closest mercenary town called Letten was over twenty miles away.
Lucas had been told all this information yesterday when he had bought it.
Chu Shen and Lucas left the town until they were a little bit aways. Lucas deployed his jetpack and held out his hand. Chu Shen looked at it like it was a snake.
“What, I’m not going to bite okay?” Lucas asked, looking amused.
“I just want to make sure you aren’t going to suddenly take off again.” Chu Shen said, looking suspiciously at him.
Lucas shrugged before suddenly he jumped forward and grabbed Chu Shen around his waist before he could react.
FWOOOOSH
They instantly shot upwards. “WAAAAAAAAAAA. THIS IS WHY I HATE YOU LUUUUCCCAAAAASSSSSSS!”
“HAHAHAHAHA. I love your friends disciple. You should try and get more like this. HAHAHAHAHA.” Master Ti Wu sounded inside his head.
“Shut up master.”
“"HAHAHAHAHA”” Both Master Ti Wu and Lucas laughed at Chu Shen as they rapidly flew north.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 76 - Cliffhanger</h1>
 
Bang
Chu Shen flew backwards as a black hairy arm retracted. Lucas punched the ape in the back, making it stumble backwards. Reaching back it grabbed his hand and threw him away into a tree over 100 meters away. Lucas rolled to a stop but instead of rushing back to help he stood there watching.
The ape snorted as a black flame appeared around its body. The black flame lumped together in the ape’s palms, forming a flaming glove over it. Suddenly the ape punched forward towards Chu Shen who had just gotten up.
A gloved fist made of Qi surged towards him. If he didn’t block it then Chu Shen would certainly suffer.
Suddenly a gray glow appeared around him in the form of armor. The Qi formed into a full body armor with sharp edges and spikes sticking out of the joints and forehead.
The fist hit the armor and seemed to sink into it. The gray armor suddenly became realistic where the fist hit, like it was true armor and not a martial art.
Chu Shen suddenly blurred and disappeared. The ape quickly turned around, looking for it’s foe. A hammer struck the ape on the side of the head sending it smashing into the ground, completely ignoring it's black flame armor.
The ape only had a slight discoloration on its skull from the strong hit but unexpectedly it didn’t get up. As it laid there a gray liquid slowly oozed out from its ears.
Chu Shen nodded as he looked at the result of his training. For the past month both him and Lucas had been coming into the forest and finding strong beasts like this to fight.
Everyday they would try out new inventions and martial arts, trying to perfect their understanding. So far, Chu Shen had been able to advance to the first stage of the Song of The Universe, The Stars Dance, Comet Travels Through, and Cancellation Armor.
The stars dance was about short precise movements making it a great dodging technique while comet travels through was about fast straight movements. It was best used to close the distance between opponents which was how he used it against the shadow flame ape.
Song of The Universe was also used in his hammer blow. Using his Qi to pass vibrations through his hammer he liquified the apes brain, killing it with one blow. Unfortunately until he reached another stage this only worked on bare skin.
He practiced his Void King technique as well, breaking through to the nineteenth circulation. Now his skin was as tough as black iron, letting him take medium strength blows head on of those at the same level as him and getting away with only a bruise.
He was now as strong as a Martial Student level 9 as a Martial Student level 4. His strength had increased from 30,000 pounds to 35,000 since he broke through to level 4 and he had increased his strength by using the Void King technique. He increased it by 1955 to 36,955 pounds.
While this may not seem like a lot remember that a level 1 Martial Student only had 20,000 pounds of force. Not the 30,000 that he had when he broke through. At the same stage most cultivators would have 25,000 pounds of force. This mean he had almost 40% more strength than other cultivators.
Lucas on the other hand had definitely grown a lot as well. While they were not able to kill a primordial beast every day they did kill a lot of them. Most of the primordial beasts were class 4 with a couple being class 3 beasts that attacked them.
Of course, Lucas was able to avoid a vast majority of class 3 beasts with his tracking program but occasionally there was exceptions. Most beasts had exceptional senses so if the beasts wanted to track them down the most they could do was keep ahead of the beasts.
Instead of avoiding such determined beasts, Chu Shen and Lucas would kill them. Using the money earned from the pelts, beast cores, and meat they were able to pay for their hotel and daily expenses.
However the most important thing was that using the money they were able to buy more raw materials for the fabber. Lucas was overjoyed when they were finally able to create a laser pistol.
But the one thing that truly surprised Chu Shen was when Lucas asked Chu Shen to teach him about inscriptions. It turns out he was a natural. To inscribe inscriptions one needed to channel energy into the ink as they made a pattern on the object.
One needed to fluctuate the energy as they inscribed in order to create the perfect inscription. It required intense concentration to accomplish. For Lucas however it was easy. Chu Shen was shocked at how easy it was to grasp what he had been trying to master for seven years.
Shaking his head wryly Chu Shen could only attribute it to karma. It was just like how shocked Lucas was when he himself mastered engineering to Lucas’ level in a year.
He could read energy levels using his scanners and then replicate them using his body as a circuit. Channelling electricity to replicate Qi he could energize the inscription ink. Of course he could also replicate the inscription drawing exactly.
They hunted down lightning frogs, a class 3 beast with a lightning affinity. Plugging the beast cores into the modified channelling inscription several at a time Chu Shen and Lucas would take a day off to recharge Lucas each week.
Chu Shen would reflect on improvements he could make to his martial arts. Lucas also would have the fabber make several things while he recharged. By now Lucas was very satisfied with how everything was going.
Lucas and Chu Shen headed back to the hotel with the corpse of the shadow flame ape in their spatial ring. Corpses of several class 3 wind wolves were also stored.
After selling the corpses they quickly went back to the hotel. Lucas had been talking to Chu Shen about an idea he had. Once there Lucas got to work using a model pistol. The pistol had a very weird powersource.
Instead of a powercell there was instead a round slot as though it was meant for something else...……
Taking out the round indent from the pistol, Lucas also took out some inscription ink. Drawing a modified amplification and channelling inscription on it took a while. About half an hour before it succeeded.
Finally Lucas put it back. Chu Shen on the other hand was almost done with his version as well. After another ten minutes he finished with his. He wiped sweat off his brow.
“Lucas you monster. I spent eight years learning this from my master and you somehow still beat me. You’re like a machine, you never even mess up the inscription.” Chu Shen shook his head.
“How apt your words are chap. Anyway let's get to work my good boy.” Lucas said in a British accent. Chu Shen punched him lightly in the arm.
Shrugging it off he picked up the shadow flame ape beast core. He plugged it into the inscripted socket which he had put back in the pistol. Chu Shen did the same with a stone frog core.
“So what do we do now?” Chu Shen asked.
“Now we test it out. But……. We can’t exactly fire it in our room.” Lucas shrugged helplessly. “We could try it out on the outskirts of the forest but it is late.”
“Well I can’t stand the cliffhanger, can you?” Chu Shen asked.
Lucas nodded. “ It won’t take too long.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 77 - Testfire</h1>
 
“So before we testfire these things how about I go ahead and try out my other tools so we can compare them?” Lucas begged Chu Shen.
Rolling his eyes, Chu Shen agreed. “Fine, but only the offensive ones. I know you are experimenting with the force fields still but we need to have firepower.”
“Fine.” Lucas conceded. Ever since he started inventing more things Chu Shen had looked into getting him a spatial ring. However, they were very expensive. So instead they got a bag that Chu Shen inscribed with the [Earth Shattering Inscription].
With the inscription, the bag lightened everything inside the bag. They also paid for a [Shrinking Inscription] which made whatever was put inside the bag smaller. It was similar to spatial rings but not quite since it didn’t create a pocket dimension.
They paid extra to see the inscription master inscribe it and then Lucas copied the scene down along with the energy readings. Thanks to that he was able to inscribe the inscription on small pouches he wore on his clothes. There was over a dozen pouches including the backpack he wore.
Speaking of the backpack, many people wore bags slung over their shoulder, not a pack strapped to their pack. It attracted much attention and eventually people started trying to recreate it. Once it succeeded, it became wildly popular since it didn’t restrict arm movement much.
Lucas withdrew a small gun very similar to the prototype gun without the socket. Aiming at a tree trunk in front of them, he fired. A red beam of energy shot out and disappeared instantly.
Looking at the trees in front of them a pencil width hole had been punched through the tree and even several trees behind the first one. The wood around the hole was scorched and even some flames started up.
Obviously this was the laser gun. It could pierce through any of the class 4 beasts body shield easily. Not to mention that it could continuously produce that beam of energy for over five minutes before the barrel needed to be cooled down. But over 20% of the energy would be consumed.
Next he took out a round ball the size of a softball. Gripping it tightly it flashed blue once. Throwing it outward, within a breath of time it suddenly exploded outwards.
A sphere of blue energy shot out before being sucked back into the ball. Glancing where the ball was there was a perfect sphere cut out around the metal ball including rock. An extreme heat still lingered in the air.
This was a plasma grenade that would send out a large wave of superheated plasma in a 100 foot diameter. Using magnetic fields it would control the ionized plasma to stay in this perimeter before sucking it back into the ball.
By providing it with some energy it could then reheat the plasma, it could also be remote activated making it a very versatile tool. Lucas stretched out his hand and the ball flew into his hand. Using a magnetic grappling hook was useful sometimes.
Finally Lucas took out a pair of elbow length gloves. The gloves also had a rectangular box-ish thing attached to the top of the forearm. It was round and streamlined but it still looked like a box. A barrel poked out the end of it, ending just above the wrist.
Lucas put on the gloves. “You know, I made this last time and I haven’t had a chance to fire it yet. It’s a railgun. However, as you know lightning steel is far superior to any superconductor in my dimension when it is at a hundred percent purity. As a result, this tiny railgun is almost as strong as a fighters.”
Aiming with his right hand, he unleashed a shot at a small grove of trees about two hundred feet away.
BOOOOOM CRA-CRA-CRA-CRAAAAACK
Flinching from the loud sound of a bullet flying at Mach 20, Chu Shen quickly looked at the grove to assess the damage. There wasn’t any trees left. At all. For over half a mile where Lucas had fired it.
Lucas shrugged. “Not as powerful as I thought. I loaded a blunt round so that it would crush the target instead of pierce it. I have a piercing round in the left glove though.”
Chu Shen quickly waved it away. “NO! DON’T FIRE IT HERE! If you do you might attract some strong beasts. There are still class 6 beasts we can’t handle. Or at least.” He looked at the destruction in front of him. “I don’t think we can.”
Lucas shrugged again. “Fine. Time to test fire the beast core pistol anyway. Actually, I think we should call it something else.”
Chu Shen rolled his eyes. “Oh yeah? Like what?”
“Like….. Beast Pistols.” Lucas posed with the beast core pistol pointed in the air. Chu Shen promptly face palmed.
“No. Never.”
“Okay. What about….. Primordial Pistol. I mean, you did say these were primordial beasts so it makes sense.”
Chu Shen adopted a thoughtful look before shrugging. “Fine. It sounds better than beast pistol plus it will make you happy.”
Lucas jumped in the air with excitement. “YEEEHA. Anyway, why did you choose these beast cores anyways. I mean, you said we couldn’t use any core but these. So why is that?” He asked with a questioning tilt of his head.
Chu Shen sighed. “Simple. Beast spirits. These cores have a beast spirit in them. You see I told you about soul right?”
“Yep. It controls Qi so you can cultivate.”
“Ah huh. Beasts also have a soul and sometimes it can become trapped inside the beast core. This is a beast soul. By taking a beast spirit and putting it into an artifact there is a possibility of imbuing it with a skill of the beast. Like the shadow fox's Shadow Cloak. However a beast spirit also recharges the beast core with energy unce it’s drained. This way we don’t have to keep on buying beast cores but we can keep on using them.”
Lucas shrugged. “Then why do people keep gathering beast cores. Eventually there would be tons of cores that keep refilling so they can keep on cultivating.:
“You would think so but when an artifact is forged using a beast spirit, the core is also destroyed. So in order to make weapons, one must destroy a beast core. Not to mention that it is not a guaranteed success. Usually several cores are wasted to make a spirit weapon. As a result, more beasts are hunted down to make more weapons as the old ones are destroyed by age or use.”
Chu Shen shook his head. “Anyways you got my hopes up saying you would test the Primordial Pistol. So why are you delaying so long.”
Lucas sighed. “Yeah. So let’s fire this baby up!”
He pointed the Primordial Pistol towards the other side of the forest.
Very slowly he pulled the trigger.
And the Primordial Pistol fired.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 78 - Old Lady</h1>
 
A black colored fire shot out in a column in front of Lucas. It looked like a flamethrower. With even the slightest touch the trees would vanish into a putrid black ash. The black flame spread quickly, burning holes in whatever it touched, clinging to whatever it burned.
Over a half-mile of forest over twenty feet across was burned to ash instantly and even more was being destroyed as the fire spread. In an experiment Lucas dropped a thing of water on it but it instantly turned into steam without snuffing out the fire.
Chu Shen reached out a hand covered in Qi. As his hand touched the fire he sensed a strong corrosive and burning force trying to destroy it. Instantly he started using null Qi, which cancelled out the destructive forces of the shadow flame.
Observing carefully, as bits of ash landed on the trees surrounding them, they started to wither away from the corrosive force. Chu Shen released a surge of null Qi, putting out the fire and stopping the corrosion of the trees.
Lucas shook his head. “Well. That wasn’t expected.”
Chu Shen shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know what happened. In terms of instant destructiveness your tools win. However, in terms of killing I think this Shadowflame Primordial Pistol wins. Without my null Qi the Shadowflame would have eventually burnt me to death from just a touch."
Lucas nodded. “Yeah. That shadowflame is insane. It clings to anything it touches, burning and corroding it. It’s like an acidic napalm. It can even burn pure energy. It would be exceedingly troublesome to deal with."
Lucas then looked at Chu Shen’s Primordial Pistol. “Well we test fired the shadow flame ape core. Let’s try the stone frogs instead.”
Nodding in agreement, Chu Shen aimed at the forest. Pulling the trigger his pistol fired.
A brownish-yellow colored beam shot out and struck the trees in front. Instead of smashing the trees, an earthen shell formed around the trees encasing them in over meter thick rock. Firing the laser pistol at the tree it was revealed that besides the rock covering the tree nothing else happened.
Chu Shen handed the pistol to Lucas. “Alright, fire it at me. I need to see how powerful it is.” Lucas fired it at Chu Shen. Just like with the trees he became encased in rock.
All except for his head. A gray helmet made of null Qi protected it from being encased in stone. However, Chu Shen was not able to move. Trying to break apart the rock he couldn’t even budge. Circulating his Qi he unleashed a vibrational force. Cracks appeared on the stone but nothing else happened.
Using up more Qi he used Song of The Universe to slowly weaken the rock covering. Then with a quick jerk he destroyed the cracked rock cocoon. Gesturing towards himself he looked at Lucas.
“Fire it again. I need to know something.” Nodding Lucas fired the earthen colored beam. This time after being encased in rock Chu Shen suddenly used a burst of null Qi in a shockwave around him.
When it came in contact with the rock shell it instantly shattered back into earthen colored energy before being absorbed into the null Qi. The Qi shot back into Chu Shen who absorbed it.
Chu Shen stretched his back for a second while laying out his thoughts on the new weapon. “It might not be as destructive, but it certainly can hold someone off. Unless they are a Martial Practitioner it should be able capture them for a good thirty minutes. Otherwise it might delay them for a minute or two.”
Lucas nodded. “Agreed. Physically you are as strong as a Martial Student Level 8 and even you had to use a martial art to weaken it. Unless they have an unarmed martial art it should hold them up long enough to kill them or escape.”
“Okay, since we tested out the new weapons we should head back. I am pretty tired from all the hunting we did earlier.”
“Alright wuss.”
“Hey! Just because you’re a cyborg and can’t get tired doesn’t mean you can look down on me!”
“It’s not my fault that you’re fatigued so don’t blame me for pointing out facts.”
“ARRGH.” Chu Shen threw his hands in the air and stomped huffily towards the hotel. Lucas chuckled and followed him a victorious smirk on his face.
The next day they got up to go hunting like they normally did. But while walking through town they encountered some weird rumors…
“Hey did you hear about that battle yesterday?”
“Yeah. I heard that it was a class 5, maybe even a class 6 beast.”
“Nah. I heard it was several class 5 beasts with a fire and shadow element between them.”
“I saw the wrecked forest myself. If I had been there then I would have died just from the aftershocks. Luckily it’s an isolated section of the woods so no one died. Probably.”
Lucas and Chu Shen looked at each other with an awkward grin at each other. How could they know test firing some weapons would cause such a disturbance.
Shrugging it off, they both went back to their regular process of hunting primordial beasts for money. Chu Shen and Lucas were in the middle of killing a pack of wind wolves when something disturbed them.
“AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!”
A high pitched scream echoed out from inside the forest. With no hesitation Chu Shen immediately smashed the wind wolf he was fighting into the ground and ran off towards the sound of the scream.
Simultaneously Lucas activated his plasma gauntlet, making a blade of blue iridescent plasma jut out from his gloved forearm. Swiping it at two wind wolves he cut them in half and ran after Chu Shen.
Quickly arriving from his movement technique, Chu Shen came across a heart rending scene.
A young girl of about eight was huddled against a tree screaming while a fairly old lady was standing in front of her. One of the old lady's arms was missing, the stump still bleeding.
Facing them was a bladed ape. A metal attribute level 3 beast that had extremely hard metal blades that grew all over its body. It had a human hand in its mouth and was eating it. It was no surprise considering the beasts habits. It would slice its prey up into pieces before devouring them. The Bladed Apes loved it when it’s prey was in fear.
Chu Shen rushed in right as the bladed ape swung down at the old lady's neck. Swinging his hammer he hit the apes side, crushing it’s ribs and sending it flying.
When it landed it immediately tried to get up and run. Before it could a beam of energy shot through it’s forehead, killing it instantly. Lucas holstered his laser pistol before walking up to the old lady. Taking out some gauze, he helped staunch the bleeding.
Taking out a blood coagulating pill, Chu Shen gave several of them to the old lady before moving onto the young girl. She had nothing wrong with her thankfully. Lucas checked out their surroundings before declaring it safe. Chu Shen then asked some questions.
It turns out the old lady was a herb gatherer. Risking her life she would go into the outskirts of the forest and forage for herbs there. Usually she would have her husband with her but he fell ill. In order to pay for the doctor she needed to gather herbs quickly so she took her granddaughter with her.
Unfortunately a Bladed Ape found them on the outskirts and chased them deep into the forest where they were currently. Feeling pity, Lucas and Chu Shen agreed to escort them back to town.
They soon arrived back in town with a minimum delay from Lucas avoiding all primordial beasts unlike their usual hunting. As the old lady and the young girl started heading back Lucas followed them with his eyes.
“I feel really bad for her.”
“Yeah. With her arm gone how can she be expected to fend for herself now. Not to mention she still has to go back and gather more herbs for the doctors bill.”
Lucas adopted a thoughtful look. “You know. I scanned her arm. I think I can make a prosthetic for her now.”
Sighing Chu Shen agreed. “Well if we can help her we should. It’s just too pitiful to see them like this.”
Running after the old lady he quickly reached her. “Hey, mam! Mam! Wait up for a second.”
The old lady looked back and stopped, bowing towards him. “Yes benefactor, how can we poor people help you.”
“I think we can help you with your arm.” The old lady looked at him for a second, confused, before the words he spoke sunk in. Wide eyed with shock she stammered out.
“I-i-is it t-t-true. C-can you really help me regain my arm?!”
Chu Shen nodded. “Yes but we need an hour or so to make preparations. Could you tell us where to find you?”
The oldy lady quickly nodded. “We live on the street behind the Mystical Herbal Garden, in the wooden shack three houses down.”
“Alright. We will go there once the preparations are done.” With that said they quickly returned to the hotel room to start fabbing a prosthetic for the old lady.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 79 - Business</h1>
 
Chu Shen and Lucas got to work. First they had to make a design for the prosthetic. Of course they couldn’t have it run off of a battery. This world didn’t have technology so if they weren’t around when its power went out then what would the poor old lady do?
She would return to being armless of course! So they started adapting it to run off of beast cores, just like Lucas did. Luckily both of them had experience with this so the work was done quickly and efficiently.
First the arm was put together along with motors and hydraulics to move everything. Then there was an indent on the upper part of the arm. Pressing the indent for ten seconds would reveal a small hole meant for the beast core. There was inscriptions placed on the bottom of the hole that channeled the cores energy.
Removing the metal bands around it holding the core in place, one could then replace it with another core. It could also be expanded an inch or two, allowing for more powerful beast cores to be loaded into the socket. After all, a beast core’s level was determined by how big it was though usually it was only an inch difference between levels.
Finally there was the attachment socket and nerve reader. Intercepting and understanding the electric signals sent by the brain to the non-existent arm, the prosthetic was able to understand exactly what to do. Of course, there was also the calibrations that needed to be done on sight.
Finished, Chu Shen and Lucas set out to the old lady’s house within the hour. Arriving they discovered the old lady wasn’t exaggerating when she said it was a wooden shack. It was a single room house that was made of basically twigs. It looked like a strong wind would blow it down.
The only source of fire to cook with a dented and rusty old kettle next to a campfire pit outside. Chu Shen sighed as he saw these miserable settings. Lucas shook his head as well.
The old lady had her back to us stirring whatever was cooking inside the kettle with her one hand. The other still had bandages on it. Chu Shen quickly got her attention by clearing his throat. “Ahem. Mam, we arrived like we said we would.”
The old lady quickly turned around and greeted them. “Ah yes! It’s the young benefactors. I apologize for not noticing you sooner.”
Lucas quickly waved his hand in front of him. “Please don’t be so formal. We were just helping out like any other human would do.”
She quickly shook her head. “That may be so but you still deserve respect. Not to mention you might be able to fix my arm. That is going far beyond what I deserve.”
“Cough, cough. Ling Xi, are those the young boys you told me about?” A hoarse voice called out from inside the hut.
“Yes it is. Now be quiet, you need your rest.” The old lady, Lang Xi, quickly poked her head inside the hut and scolded. Obviously this was the sick person they needed to hire the doctor for.
“Come here boys, Cough Cough.” Chu Shen and Lucas walked in to see an elderly old man who looked to be in his late fifties lying on a blanket in the wooden hut. Bowing their heads respectfully, Chu Shen and Lucas stood beside the old man.
The old man tried to sit up but Ling Xi quickly held him down. “Stop moving! You need your rest!”
“No!” The old man shrugged her off of him. Looking at both of them for a couple seconds he nodded. “Please youngsters, tell me your names and how old you two are.”
“I am Chu Shen, 13 years old and this is Lucas Webil, fifteen years old.”
Lucas looked at Chu Shen. “I thought you were twelve.”
He shrugged. “I had my birthday two months ago.”
Lucas shook his head. “We’ll have to celebrate later then.”
A cough interrupted them. Looking back at the old man they both grinned sheepishly.
Ignoring the small outburst, the old man nodded. “And I am Lang Wen, you two youngsters have a bright future. Thank you for saving my wife and granddaughter’s lives. If not for you I would have lost them. If there is anything I can do let me know.”
“We will. Now we have what is needed to regain your arm. However, before it is perfected we need to run some tests, please step outside.” Chu Shen asked Lang Xi politely. They both went outside back to beside the cooking stew.
Lang Xi seemed hesitant at first before shrugging. Her instincts told her these kids wanted to help her. So she decided to trust them. Unwrapping the bandage, she exposed her cut off arm. Normally a person would still have scabs and tissue hanging out. However, Chu Shen gave her medicinal pills earlier that healed her arm in the hour they were apart.
It was considered quite fast for a pill and it cost forty silver to buy. Very expensive and a staple of any mercenary.. But to Chu Shen it was worth it since it would only take a couple days to earn it back. Otherwise how could they attach the prosthetic?
Taking the prosthetic he activated the socket and put it on the stump of Lang Xi. Unfortunately the arm had no fake skin and was pure metal. But it was still sleek and streamlined, making it look dangerous.
Lang Xi just looked at the metal arm for a second. It resembled her old arm exactly except that it was made of metal. She was puzzled at this outcome. What she was expecting was a medicine that could regrow her arm. This metal arm though…… She just really didn’t know what it was supposed to do.
“What exactly am I supposed to do now.” She asked with a questioning shrug. Then she stopped, frozen. When she opened her palm in a helpless gesture, she felt not one, but two hands moving. Looking down very slowly at the metal hand, it was in the same position as her other hand, though it was off by a couple inches.
Ling Xi just stared, frozen, at the metal arm. Tears slowly trickled down her cheek. She never truly thought that these young boys could actually give back her arm.
“All right then. Since we can confirm it works, let’s fine tune it shall we? First close your eyes and lift your left hand directly above your head. Now your other. Okay, let me adjust this hereeee……. Done. Okay try it again.”
“Now try moving your fingers. Just your pointer finger for now. Then the next one. Okay now make a fist.” It was decided that Lucas would do the calibration since he could control the internal systems and adjust them without tools.
Soon Lang Xi was moving her arm like normal. Lang Wen cried as well once they managed to show him his wife’s arm. Taking them aside, Lucas told them what they needed to do to keep it running.
“If it runs out then replace it with a beast core from a lightning attribute beast. Just press here and take out the old one and replace it with a new one. A class 1 beast core will last a year and a class 3 will last fifty years. The current one is a class 2 that should last twenty years so don’t worry.”
Chu Shen and Lucas decided to say goodbye then. However, just as they were about to leave, Lang Wen stopped them.
“Wait a moment young fellows!”
Pausing they looked back at him with a questioning look. “What is it?” Lucas asked.
“I just wanted to ask you how much it cost you to make that arm and can you replace other limbs like eyes or legs.”
“About ten or twelve silver and an hour of work. We can also replace any limb including ears and the like” Lucas replied back.
Lang Wen nodded for a second before springing on them a question. “Ever thought about selling these metal limbs? I mean, this is a mercenary town. Over half the town has lost a limb of some kind even if it is only a finger. You could make a fortune.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 80 - Repayment</h1>
 
Bang Bang
“Thank you! Thank you!” The man kowtowed twice on the floor before looking up at Chu Shen. His eyes metal lenses focused on Chu Shen with a whir.
Chu Shen awkwardly nodded in acknowledgment before pulling the man to his feet. “It’s nothing really. This is a business transaction after all, nothing to be grateful over since we are taking your money for this.”
The man shook his head. “It doesn’t matter if you are doing this for the money. The simple fact that you can give me back my sight is a tremendous favor. If you ever need something ask the Agata family to find me.”
“I will do so if I need to. Don’t take this the wrong way but I hope to never see you again in my shop.” Chu Shen said as he escorted the man to the door.
For a second the man was stunned before realizing the meaning in his words. Smiling back at him with a wide grin he laughed loudly. “Of course, of course my friend. I too wish to never see the Prosthetic Shop again unless it is for tea. Take care young one.”
Chu Shen watched the man leave before letting out a sigh and sliding down the wall to the floor. Grinning wryly he envied Lucas who was enjoying his time hunting beasts in the forest. Ever since they started up the business last week they had a booming business.
It seemed as though they weren’t told everything when it was suggested they make a prosthetic shop. Apparently the bladed apes that attacked the poor Lang Xi was not uncommon. A bladed ape was the king of the forest and had become a class 7 beast. Because it was a pack beast, hordes of bladed apes infested the forest and wiped out whole towns.
It was only a year ago that it was killed by an army officer from the Blue Sky Kingdom. But the damage was done. Many people were killed but even more were maimed when the bladed apes attacked villages before being driven back.
As a result, when they opened up the shop they were swamped with people after the second day. Before that many were skeptical that such a thing as replacing an arm was a myth. They had already made over 20 gold from selling prosthetics.
Chu Shen sighed. Dealing with customers was easy. They saw it as buying a service so it was over quickly. Dealing with people who wanted to thank them and repay them with their lives or other things was NOT as easy. It was just too embarrassing.
He heard the door open. Looking up, a man built like a mountain with a black mask was looking back at him. With a quick glance he saw that the man was not missing any limbs. Curious, Chu Shen got back up and sat down behind the desk.
“This is the Prosthetic Shop, how can I help you.” He said politely.
“Oh. So you are the brat who figured out how to make fake limbs.” The man came in and stood towering above him. “I am Slaughter.”
“Nice to meet you Slaughter. It seems like you aren’t missing any limbs so can I ask what you are here for?” Chu Shen asked calmly but sweat was starting to bead up on his head. This guy seemed to be here for dishonest purposes.
“Well that's the thing.” The man leaned one huge arm on the desk while scratching his head with the other. “You see. My employer just so happens to be a fellow craftsmen. And when he heard that you could make someone an arm he got curious. So would you mind sharing just how you do it?”
A powerful force pressed down on Chu Shen. Putting both hands on the desk, Slaughter leaned forward and looked directly in his eyes. “And since I am such a nice guy, how about you give it to me for free hmm?”
Sweat poured down Chu Shen’s back in buckets. This guy was serious. But revealing the fabber would be a serious issue. ‘Lucas, why did you have to leave today! I hate you Lucas!’
“Well sir, that is a very sensitive issue you are asking me for. Unfortunately I don’t think I could give it to you, or even sell it.” Chu Shen said as apologetic as he could look.
“Bullsh*t. I don’t want to be accused of bullying someone of the younger generation but I need that technique. So hand it over or I can kill you and wait for your partner to come back and ask him, okay?” Slaughter’s blood red color eyes stared at Chu Shen through the mask.
However, the door swung open to the Prosthetic Shop. Slaughter immediately stood up and turned towards the person. It was a man with black hair with gray streaks. Beside him was a man who seemed to be half metal. Both legs and one arm were a dull metal and both eyes were also made of metal.
It was the man who Chu Shen had escorted out of the shop not even a half-hour ago! “Slaughter. This is the shopping district under the management of the City Lord. It would be best to know when to stop. Don’t think you can blot out the sky with one hand.”
Slaughter looked at him for a second before laughing. “Well I think this gives me permission to rough up a couple street vendors without a background don’t you think?” Saying so he tossed over a black medallion. Written on it was one word. ‘Rose’.
Seeing it, the old man’s face turned hard for a second before relaxing again. “Young man, don’t think just because you were hired by the Black Rose Guild that you are invincible. This child just gave my grandson his sight back. I believe it would be better for you to leave.”
“Just leave old man.” Slaughter said. Chu Shen just sat there wondering what was going on.
The old man strode up to Slaughter. “Leave now before I have to teach the younger generation about respecting their elders.”
“I tried giving you face but you ignored me! F*ck off old man!” With a roar he punched outwards, towards the old man. The old man sighed. The fist shot into the old man’s stomach but never contacted. Before it could he bent his body backwards into a bow shape, narrowly dodging the blow.
Lifting his hand, the old man caught the other fist Slaughter send towards him. Miraculously he had raised his hand before Slaughter even moved his fist as though he could read Slaughter’s mind. Using the caught fist he hurled Slaughter out the door, smashing it to pieces.
Jumping out, the old man faced Slaughter who was just rising to his feet. Surrounding people immediately backed away, wary of being caught in a battle that they didn’t belong in.
A blood red energy covered Slaughter’s body. The old man though did not activate his body shield. With a hand, he gestured to Slaughter.
“Don’t underestimate me you old sh*t!” Slaughter raged at the old man. Orange and red swirled metal gloves appeared around his hands. Punching outwards, Qi surged around it. However, the old man appeared to have a sixth sense and dodged it before the punch was even completed.
Outraged at his blow being dodged, Slaughter let loose hundreds of blows at the old man in less than a minute. However each time he launched a fist the old man seemed to anticipate it and dodged it halfway through its attack.
“Alright youngster, I think I gave you enough of a demonstration.” The old man said while glancing over at Chu Shen.
“Hey! Don’t annoy me you dogfart!” Slaughter yelled, absolutely livid at being ignored like this. All of a sudden though he felt his body shield break and a series of sharp jabs hit all over his body. He lost all sense of feeling and fell to the ground in a senseless heap.
Meanwhile the man Chu Shen had helped earlier started talking beside him. “I returned home and less than ten minutes ago my grandpa came out of closed door cultivation. After I told him what you did for me he said he would teach you some things as a repayment. I hope you accept.”

Chu Shen didn’t want to agree right away. It was too much of a coincidence that the young man had shown up right as Slaughter did. But he also couldn’t reject geed will. So he invited them inside for tea and to discuss the specifics of the training.
Sitting down after he prepared tea, Chu Shen awkwardly sipped his tea in silence. After a minute had passed by, he finally couldn’t stand it. “All right, what kind of training are you offering?” He asked Grandmaster Qin. But surprisingly, it was the young man that answered.
“It’s very basic training. I was taught the first stages of it before I was attacked by the bladed apes and it helped me kill over ten of them before being overwhelmed with numbers. Gramps will teach it to you using our family’s illusion array so the training should be over quickly.”
Grandmaster Qin spoke up now. “The training is about reading the opponent's moves. By observing the opponent's body you will become able to tell exactly where their next blow is and what kind of movie it is. Then you can avoid or counter strike. The higher levels would be observing the opponents Qi flow but since you are an outsider I cannot teach you this.”
Chu Shen nodded. Of course high techniques like reading an opponent's Qi flow could not be taught to people outside their Agata family. Right before Chu Shen could start considering all the implications of the offer, Ti Wu’s voice sounded in his head.
‘Take this opportunity brat. What he is offering is invaluable. You would have picked it up eventually but it would have been instinctive. This is much better.’
‘If it is as helpful as you say, why didn’t you teach me it then?’
‘Well, I can’t. In order to do so properly, I must be able to reproduce an exact human body and unfortunately I can’t do it with 100% accuracy. So it would be better for you to go without learning then to learn a flawed theory.’
Sighing, Chu Shen looked at the Grandfather-grandson duo. “Alright, I accept the training. When should I expect to be there and when?”
Grandmaster Qin replied back immediately. “I’ll teach you for a week straight and then your friend. How much you learn will be up to your abilities. Come to the Agata Family Estate and show the guards this.” He gave him a token with a wave pattern on it. “Be there by ten in the morning.”
He got up and cracked his back. “Now since we are done here, I will see myself out.” With that, the two left. Not even a minute later, Lucas appeared in the shattered doorway.
Lucas slowly surveyed the wreckage of the door before looking back up at Chu Shen. “Soooo.” He said exaggeratedly. “Did something happen while i was gone?”
Chu Shen, recalling everything that happened was overjoyed. “LUCAS!!” He immediately jumped up and ran towards Lucas with open arms. For a second Lucas was stunned before opening his arms ready to accept Chu Shen’s hug.
What he didn’t expect was the fist that promptly hit him on the side of the head. “Where were you!! Every time I need you you’re gone!! Thankfully I am in need of a punching bag and you qualify! Hold still!!”
“Ah! No! Stop! Is this about all those times I flew off when you weren’t ready?! AH! Why was it harder this time?! No! Please! I might be a cyborg but I still feel pain! STOP IIIIIITTTTTT!!!!!”
Many people who walked by the shop that night shook their heads in pity. It seems as though the employee was paying dearly for the broken door.
……………………………………………
The next morning Chu Shen set out for the Agata family mansion. It was very easy to locate since they were apparently a well known noble family in the city.
It was located on the outskirts of the inner city. The city was set up in three rings with swathes of farming land separating them. There was the outer city which was meant for commoners or markets. Then the inner city that was meant for nobles and high end stores and restaurants. Last of all was the core city which was meant for the city governor and other top powerhouses.
Upon arriving, Chu Shen marveled at the sight of the enormous mansion. While it was lacking compared to the awe inspiring skyscrapers on Sparta, it seemed much prettier to him because of the way it blended with nature. It was a quant feeling just like seeing a cottage in the mountains or a meadow.
As he was admiring the beautiful gardens outside of the manor, one of the guards beside the gate called out to him. “Hey, hey kid! This is the Agata Family Manor. If you have business come in otherwise please stand off to the side to admire the view so you don’t block the road.”
The guard was quite satisfied with Chu Shen’s amazement and spoke in a polite tone to him in return. He took great pride in the beautiful manor that he guarded. Of course, he also knew that he had nothing to do with it’s looks but he was still proud of it.
Chu Shen shook himself free of his stupor. “I am here on official business. That grandpa told me to come here and give the guards this.” He took out the wave patterned token.
The guard, upon seeing it, immediately stiffened. Who would have known that foolish looking kid would actually be an honored guest! Luckily he wasn’t of the type to be arrogant otherwise he may not have such a good job by the end of the day.
“Please honored guest, right this way. We were instructed to lead you to the training hall if you stopped by this morning.” The guard swiftly lead him to a large field off to the side of the manor. Various stone pillars were erected across the field surrounding it in a circle.
“Wait here honored guest while I alert the grandmaster of your arrival.” The guard left without delay towards the manor that could be seen in the distance, leaving Chu Shen behind.
He waited patiently and after less than five minutes he spotted the guard and the old man making their way towards him. “Ah, you made it young man. You know I never asked for your name.”
“No I don’t think you did. My name is Chu Shen.” He said as he bowed slightly.
The old man nodded his head in acknowledgment. “Good. You may call me grandmaster Qin. Has the guards treated you well Chu Shen?” The guard immediately broke out into sweat at this question.
Chu Shen hurriedly shook his head. “Oh no. Even when he didn’t know my identity he was polite. You truly do have a beautiful manor by the way.”
Grandmaster Qin nodded appreciatively. “Thank you for the compliments.” He turned to the guard. As for you, good job. I never liked arrogant types, they seem to court death a lot. Go back to the gates and resume your duties.”
“Sir yes sir!” The guard saluted with a fist to his heart and the other on his spine. He marched off towards the gate, sweat still dripping from his forehead.
Grandmaster Qin turned to Chu Shen. “Now that the pleasantries are out of the way, let us get started with your training.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 82 - Doctors Godly Eyes</h1>
 
Grandmaster Qin, however, did not start right away. “Now before we begin training let me mention a few things. What you are training in is considered to be very basic techniques. However, it is derived from the basic requirements to learn <Doctors Godly Eyes>. This is a skill my ancestor came up with to participate in the martial path.”
“My ancestor was a doctor who was very talented. However, the only thing he truly had in his heart was the martial way. How unfortunate it was that he did not have a talent for such things. But he did not lose his passion for martial arts.”
“Eventually he decided to make a martial skill that combined both his medical teachings and martial arts. While a martial artist’s body shield makes them almost invincible to striking vulnerable parts such as acupuncture points until it is broken, it cannot mask the body itself.”
“So he researched how the body reacts to channeling Qi through meridians, to making certain motions, what people are thinking, and other various tests. After forty years, when he was nearing the end of his life, he created <Doctors Godly Eyes>. A unique skill that allows one to read an opponent's move and know what they are going to do almost before they know themselves.”
“Even martial arts cannot escape the all seeing eyes of the doctor. Any flaw or weakness will be picked up and exploited with surgical precision. It also allows the person to channel their Qi into their fingers and use it to pierce through the body shield to attack acupuncture points.”
“However, the requirements to learn such a high level skill is difficult. The first is to learn the human body’s muscle movements. The second is to be familiar with meridians and acupuncture. This was how my grandson survived the bladed apes, by stopping all bleeding with his medical knowledge.”
“As for you, the first thing you must learn is the human body’s muscle movements. We will use the illusionary array here to perform a demonstration. After that, we shall see.”
Suddenly Chu Shen was no longer in the plain field with rock pillars. Instead he was in a wide dirt arena and a huge person over three times the normal size stood in front of him. Strangely the person had eyes and a nose but no mouth.
“Now pay attention. Since the man is so big, you can study his movements clearly.” Grandmaster Qin said beside him. As he spoke, the giant person suddenly punched forward in slow motion. No fancy movements, only a punch directly forward.
Chu Shen didn’t know what to do though. After the punch was completed he looked at Grandmaster Qin. “So what am I supposed to do?”
Grandmaster Qin sighed. “Just study the movements of the person there. Remember everything about the way he moved. How his body tensed up, where his eyes were looking at, his stance, everything. Only after you can do that can you truly have mastered this phase.”
“Alright.” Chu Shen then started studying his movements. After 200 punches the movements changed. Giant targets would appear in midair and the punch would land on the target, shattering it, before another would take it’s place. After another 200 punches, the fist still struck outwards but at the air.
Another 200 punches struck various invisible targets before switching back to punching in a straight line. This cycle of simple, target, and invisible target punching continued for over three hours.
After the three hours was up, Grandmaster Qin stopped the giant person in the middle of the cycle. “Okay, so what did you learn?”
Chu Shen shook his head. To him it seemed pointless even though he tried his best. “I don’t think I learned anything.”
“How about this. Can you tell where my punch is going to land?” Grandmaster Qin asked. He took a stance and went through all of the steps of preparing to throw a punch but never took the final step that would send his fist flying.
Chu Shen though seemed to have a revelation. He unconsciously pointed at a place in front a little to the left of Grandmaster Qin. When he did Grandmaster Qin smiled. “Great perception. You have passed the first phase. Now the second is sparring. Only if you can apply it in real life can it be considered a skill.”
With that a normal sized faceless person that looked identical to the giant one appeared in front of him. “Alright now try to fight this drone. Sometimes it will punch, other times it won’t. Try and block them all even if it is a ghost punch.”
Chu Shen nodded. Immediately a punch hurtled towards his face. Surprised he dodged left, narrowly avoiding the blow though it still nicked his ear. Grandmaster Qin cackled. “Heh heh. First lesson. In order to read your opponents moves you must pay attention. Don’t be caught off guard.”
Shaking off the fright such a close call gave him, Chu Shen focused on the drone in front of him. The drones arms stiffened and his muscles bulged slightly. It’s stance shifted minutely in preparation of the blow. It’s eyes darted left, right, then left again before focusing on a specific point.
Immediately it’s arm drew back and hurtled towards the left side of his chest. However, right as the fist started out, it was already doomed to fail since Chu Shen’s arm was blocking it’s target. The fist collided with Chu Shen’s arm but it was only a mild impact, not even succeeding in rocking him back.
“Very good. Now practice for six hundred punches and achieve a 90% block rate or you will have to start everything over again.”  Chu Shen continued his training.
After another three hours he completed the training course. He had to redo it twice. Apparently redoing it meant watching another cycle of the giant drone and then sparring with the regular size drone.
Out of breath, Chu Shen finally finished. Sitting down, he sighed. “Finally done. So what's the next step?”
Grandmaster Qin smiled. “Why now you get to go through it again. But this time with kicks. Don’t worry about time though. It’s three times as fast in here as outside. We have a day in here before we have to leave so get ready. After this we will combine both before moving on to more advanced unarmed combat techniques like grappling.”
Grandmaster Qin smirked at Chu Shen. “So let’s continue shall we?”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 83 - New Discoveries</h1>
 
“Ugh. I’m so exhausted!” Chu Shen flopped down on the bed with a groan. Lucas gave him an inquisitive glance.
 
“That ‘Grandmaster’ Qin” He said making quotation marks in the air. “Has been training me nonstop for five days now. And to make it worse it’s actually felt like fifteen since he has that illusion array. It’s awful!”

Lucas shrugged. “Can’t be that bad.”
 
Chu Shen looked at him with a blank stare. “Yeah. I just have to look at examples of two hundred basic moves from different weapons and techniques. Then learn it so that I can predict where the moves are going to land by reading the opponent's muscles. And to top it off, if I don’t learn it, I have to do it all over again.”
 
“Yeah. That seems difficult for an organic to do. Maybe I should skip the training then.”
 
“Nuh-uh. If I have to learn it, so do you.”
 
“Well it would be redundant since I have a map of the human muscular system so I can just run a program to tell me anyways.”

Chu Shen stared at him for a second before promptly throwing a pillow, which Lucas dodged. “I hate you Lucas. I really do hate you.”

Lucas shrugged. “Well. I wanted to show you something I discovered while you were gone. I was investigating the attribute Qi from the beast cores and discovered it’s actually a 7th state of matter.”

Chu Shen looked at him. “What do you mean?”
 
Lucas sighed. “You know the other six states of matter right? Liquid, solid, gas, plasma, Bose-Einstein condensate, and hyper-matter.”
 
Chu Shen nodded. “Yeah. Well except the last two. Only briefly heard it on a physics simulation.”

“Bose-Einstein condensates are bosons, a quantum particle, cooled to absolute zero. Or at least close to it. Hyper-matter is the state of all matter in hyperspace. It is when all matter has lost all distance between the electron cloud and the nucleus.”
 
Lucas had an excited look on his face as he explained all this. “However, I found out that attribute Qi actually is a seventh state! This state is a fluctuation of matter and energy. This ‘Earth Qi’ is actually a form of energy that can fluctuate between being actual earth and energy! I even found it can temporarily turn real earth into this energy and be used to manipulate it!”
 
It was Chu Shen’s turn to shrug. “And? I knew all this anyways. I grew up seeing this.”

Lucas sighed. “Yeah, but if I can discover how to induce this seventh state it can be limitless! We use fusion and fission to power our systems now but if we can use this seventh state we will no longer be forced to use exotic matter or Hydrogen as fuel but everything! The limits on space travel could be undone! We can even turn mining into a complete waste of time!”
 
“Whoopee. Now let me get some sleep. I’m tired.” Chu Shen rolled over on the bed.
 
“Ugh! I hate it when people don’t listen!”

……………………………………………………………………………
 
Chu Shen showed up at the Agata Family mansion as usual. Just like before Grandmaster Qin was there to meet him. However, this time he was not led to the illusion formation. Instead he was led to a small table and served some tea.
 
“Hmm. Thank you Grandmaster Qin. However, why am I not training?” Chu Shen asked.
 
“Simple. You are done. While I can’t say your grasp of the basics are perfect, they are adequate. To be honest you learned quite fast. It took me several months to learn. Of course, I had to learn the entire body and how it worked instead of just the front like you did.”
 
“Why did I not learn the entire body then?”
 
“Because of time and practicality. I am teaching you how to fight an opponent and judge their moves head on. Because of that you only need to see how they move from the front. Also it would take much longer.”
 
“What I will teach you now is the fundamentals of martial arts. Or rather, some secrets that most do not learn for a long time. So pay very close attention.”
 
“Do you know what a martial art does?”
 
Chu Shen replied back hesitantly. “It enhances your power?”
 
Grandmaster Qin nodded. “Correct, but how?”

Chu Shen shrugged. “I don’t really know. Isn’t it just by circulating Qi and then releasing it?”
 
Grandmaster Qin nodded again. “True to some extent. Now let me talk about the limits of Qi. We channel Qi through our meridians. However, by channeling too much our meridians can burst. Qi also leaks through the meridians into our body. If the body absorbs too much energy it can be destroyed. That is the reason behind backlash of powerful martial arts.”
 
“Our soul also controls Qi. That is why when we absorb Qi we need to concentrate by meditating. When absorbing Qi we make it our own by imprinting our soul on it, meaning we can use it without meditating. Otherwise we would have to meditate every time we wanted to channel Qi.”
 
“However, this imprint has it’s limits. If we use too much Qi, we have to concentrate which distracts us. Distractions in a fight are fatal. It can’t happen lightly.”
 
Chu Shen nodded. Everything made sense so far. For example, when he made the shield for the soldiers during the bug war. He had to stop fighting and focus on making it. Also the body absorbing Qi was described in the <Void King> technique and was the reason having a strong body was necessary.
 
“Now let me talk about breaking these limits. Reflex actions require no thought. They happen automatically and they do not occur solely in the body but the soul as well.  An example of a reflex of the soul would be a martial artist’s body shield, an automatic reaction brought on by the bodies survival instinct.”
 
“Reflexes are made by endlessly repeating an action. Martial arts are the same. By training a martial art to the point of being a reflex for your soul, you can activate martial arts requiring large amounts of Qi without being distracted. But you must first learn how to channel Qi in those particular meridians, which can be a great roadblock to cultivators.”
 
“As for the meridians, martial arts use certain amounts of meridians to channel their energy. The more meridians used, the more energy can be channeled. Of course, these meridians, even for the basic martial art, is over a hundred since the outer meridians are in the millions.”

“Lastly is the body. By spreading out the Qi between meridians you can avoid such backlash. However, sometimes it is a necessary price. Now there is one more feature of martial arts. Creating a structure.”
 
“Qi evaporates when it leaves your body. But by making  a structure, you can allow it to hold it’s form longer. It can also have effects like making blades that slice, shields, increasing your speed, or your bodies strength.”
 
“However, do not think that just by being able to circulate Qi in random ways one will create a martial art. By thinking this way you can destroy yourself from backfire if the Qi does not create a structure but instead destabilizes.”
 
“The reason martial arts is often based off of nature or animals is because by studying the circulation of Qi in animals or plants and how it affects such objects, one can copy the Qi flow and recreate the objects.”
 
“These are the secrets of martial arts.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 84 - Black Rose Strikes Again</h1>
 
Chu Shen was astonished at all of this. Martial arts creating images was basic knowledge. That was why there was fist, sword, and claw techniques. And often phantom images would appear in the Qi, for example a claw technique resembling a bird's claw instead of a human's fingers.
This truly explained many mysteries that eluded Chu Shen. Before now he simply accepted martial arts intricacies as the way things were. ‘Hmm. It seems as though there is still a science that can be found in such mysterious things. Truly there is no such thing as magic, only misunderstood principles.’
Chu Shen stood up and bowed to grandmaster Qin. “Thank you grandmaster. With your help, I feel I will be able to advance far in mastering my skills.”
Agata Qin quickly waved his hand. “Nonsense. Eventually you would have learned such things. It wasn’t always common knowledge you know. Until the <Doctors Godly Eyes> was created, it remained a mystery. But my ancestor figured out such things and shared it, making these facts public knowledge.”
“It could be said to have advanced the skills of everyone within a thousand miles. Many people were thankful for such a blessing. If it wasn’t for that calamity, we wouldn’t be confined to such a small town.”
Grandmaster Qin shook his head. “Well, anyway. What I have here is a basic martial art technique. A fist technique. Learn it well. I believe with what I have taught you, you should advance far. Now, you can leave. My lessons are over. Tell your friend to come over for lessons tomorrow.”
Chu Shen looked at him for a second. “Huh? I still have one more day left don’t I? So why am I being sent back?”
Grandmaster Qin sighed. “It is just as I said. I have no more to teach you. In order to advance farther you would require at least another month. So instead of ending things half baked, I would rather end it here. As for the day left, just stop by to ask some questions if you encounter a bottleneck.”
Chu Shen nodded. “Okay. Having an expert to question is worth losing a day of training.”
A pain stabbed in his brain making Chu Shen wince. ‘Hey brat! You still have this expert. So why aren’t you questioning me!’
Chu Shen had a strange face on when he heard Master Wu’s voice. He couldn’t say the truth could he? That he didn’t feel like Ti Wu could help him. Otherwise what awaited him could be said to be hell.
He immediately adopted a placating tone mentally. ‘It’s not that master. I just feel like with how strong you are, to ask such basic questions would be considered an insult so it would be better to ask someone like this Grandmaster Qin.’
‘Hmph. What ‘Grandmaster’. In my eyes he is still just a brat. Hey brat. That Qin fellow is looking at you weird, pay attention!’
Indeed, when Chu Shen looked up Grandmaster Qin was staring at him with a look of concern. “Are you alright Chu Shen? It seemed like you blanked out there for a second.”
Chu Shen immediately shook his head. “No, no of course not! I just… I just had an inspiration that was all. Anyways I should head back to the shop to inform Lucas.”
Grandmaster Qin nodded in agreement. “Alright then. Have a safe journey. Don’t forget to give him the Token as well.”
“I won’t!” Chu Shen called over his shoulder as he walked back to the shop.
………………………………………………………………
While Chu Shen received the lecture on martial arts, Lucas went out hunting for primordial beasts. Every week they would close the shop for a day in order to gather beast cores for their experiments. Or more specifically, his. Today was no different even without Chu Shen.
But after an hour of hunting his tracking program discovered four people behind him. Ignoring it, Lucas merely went in a different direction. It wasn’t uncommon to come across people in the forest so it was probably coincidence. However they immediately turned to follow him as well!
Lucas frowned at this. Why would they do that? Were they following him? At this thought he immediately became cautious. Turning, he immediately started running in a zigzag path that would take him back to town. If he got there, they wouldn’t dare fight since it would mean offending the city lord.
However, even though these people were over 800 feet away, once they realized Lucas had discovered them, they immediately took off like a flash of lightning. In less than ten seconds they had already surrounded Lucas.
Lucas seeing who it was that stepped in front of him immediately recognized him. Pointing at him he called out. “You! It was actually you Slaughter!”
Indeed. The man that was hunting him was Slaughter! He laughed at the face Lucas made. “Haha! Indeed it is me. Now that you aren’t in town I don’t even have to bring up the Black Rose Guild. Come on brothers. We can finally collect that rich reward from that artificer.”
The man on the left shook his head. “It’s embarrassing Slaughter that you called us in. This child has no cultivation base so why exactly did you invite us to share in the spoils. It’s not like you.”
Slaughter shrugged. “I wasn’t sure if it was a trap that old guy put out for us. After all, why would someone with no cultivation base come out into the beast forest. Luckily we can’t detect anyone so maybe I’m just paranoid.”
He turned to Lucas. “So brat. You were just a mortal. And a trashy mortal at that. No matter. We just want information. How can you create those fake limbs. Tell us and we just might spare your life.”
Lucas reacted with lightning fast actions. Pulling out the Primordial Pistols, he also dropped two basketball size metal objects from the pouches. The four men were astonished at how fast Lucas moved, but other than that they didn’t really put him in their eyes.
That is, until the primordial pistols fired.
One of them was hit with the earth Primordial pistol, sealing him inside it. The other was struck with the shadow flame, enveloping him in a black corrosive flame along with a swath of forest around him.
“AHHH! IT BURNS! IT BURNS!” Due to the arrogance of facing a mortal, the unlucky cultivator didn’t even have his body shield up. His body started to wither as the black flame caught his skin on fire.
A surge of Qi briefly overwhelmed the flames making them flicker but they were not put out. Instead, they still burned on the cultivators body. Still screaming in pain, the cultivator immediately swallowed a medicinal pill before sitting down to try and suppress the shadow flames.
Slaughter, who was not hit by either shot was immediately stunned at how this ‘trashy mortal’ suddenly became so dangerous. Immediately he put up his body shield, alerted to this pig who became a tiger.
Lucas, on the other hand, immediately took off in a direct beeline for the town. The fourth member, who was not struck by either attack, took off after Lucas. As for the one sealed in rock, cracks already appeared in the shell. After all, all of them were Martial Practitioners Level 3.
However, the one that took off after Lucas was suddenly hit by two red beams of light. His body shield immediately started to dim as his Qi was drained. Stunned he turned to find out where these lights were coming from.
Unexpectedly, those two metal objects had become two spider like drones with lasers mounted on their heads. Running sideways like a crab, these spiders kept up a beam of heat at this man. At the speed of light, there was no way the man could dodge a laser.
But in a flash, the man appeared beside the spiders and struck out with his palm. While it was true he couldn’t dodge a laser, he could move out of its path. He was simply too fast for the turrets to track his movements.
The spiders were able to dodge the palm itself though, but not the faint energy palm that struck both of them, crushing them instantly. In a flash of light, both spiders blew up.
With a sinister glare at the retreating Lucas, a bow appeared in the man’s hands. Aiming, he suddenly unleashed an arrow at Lucas. In an instant, the arrow pierced completely through his leg!
Slaughter, who had already started chasing Lucas after shaking off his shock, immediately caught up to Lucas who had fallen down from the shot. Unexpectedly though, he was not rolling on the ground in pain. Instead he turned towards Slaughter with a strange glove on and fired it.
Before he could blink, Slaughter was pierce completely through the chest, his body shield breaking in an instant. He was hurled up into the air, a large hole appearing where his chest should be. A loud BOOOM and shock wave of air caused the leaves of the trees nearby to be blow off.
The man with the bow was stunned. Without a doubt, Slaughter was dead. Lucas turned towards the man with the bow and raised his hand. In response an arrow flew towards him, piercing through his skull instantly causing sparks to fly out the quarter sized hole.
Lucas, looking stunned, suddenly looked back at the man. Another BOOOM was heard as the man also had a large hole blown through his body. Lucas got up and started running. “Whew. If I wasn’t a cyborg, I would be dead!” Lucas wiped off some nonexistent sweat as he ran.
But suddenly, a sword pierced through his back. The sword sliced upwards, slicing Lucas in half from the waist up! A shower of sparks and wires followed the cut. Another slice came. And another. And another. A torrent of blows came and sliced Lucas up until no piece bigger than a fist remained.
The person responsible, the one sealed in the rock, stood behind Lucas’ torn corpse. He slumped to the ground. “What monster is this! He didn’t even have flesh, only metal for a body.”
The man turned and looked back at the huge swathe of devastation that came from Lucas’ weapon. He shook his head. “I’m lucky I wasn’t hit with that black flame. Even Murder wasn’t able to shake it off and died.”
A sinister smile came over him. “At least I am the only one to receive the treasure this time.” However, an inconspicuous ball in the corpse of Lucas started flashing. Glancing over, the man picked it up. “What is this, his heart?”
Unexpectedly a voice answered back. The voice came from a black box just a little bit away from him. “No, actually that is my reactor. Don’t worry though. You can keep it. It’s the last you will ever see.”
Later a half mile radius of the forest was reported gone, wiped out by some massive explosion. Many people became nervous, fearing that the primordial beasts may be acting up again.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 85 - Lucas Is Dead</h1>
 
Chu Shen walked into the shop. “Lucas. Hey Lucas! That old geezer let me off early today! Can’t wait til it’s your turn~”
Chu Shen walked around the shop for a bit but didn’t see him. “Huh. Guess he isn’t here. Wait. Has he been goofing around the whole time i’ve been practicing!” Chu Shen had that immediate thought resound in him.
For a second he looked absolutely convinced. Then he shook his head. “Nope. Can’t be. What could have convinced him to leave the shop then. A sale, new materials, wait. New materials. That’s right, we were supposed to hunt some beasts today.”
“He must have decided to go hunt some by himself since I was busy training. Oh well, nothing bad could have happened.” Chu Shen smiled. Good old Lucas, he played awful jokes sometimes but at least he was a reliable.
Chu Shen went into the back room to the fabber to go over some designs he was thinking of. After all, the fabber had a quantum processor that could handle all the calculations necessary to fabricate items.
Even so, it was vastly underutilized and Chu Shen designed it that way. It was supposed to also function as a 3-d design room which explained the reason there was holograms on a fabber. But it did not explain the reason they activated once Chu Shen walked in the room.
A holographic projection of Lucas appeared before Chu Shen. The holo Lucas smiled and waved at him. “Hey Chu Shen. If you are watching this, I died.”
………………………………………………………………..
Inside the city, there was a large building. Surprisingly the entire building was built with black iron. Gold and Jade decorated the building. Such expensive materials lavishly used must mean the people who built this were quite powerful.
A sign hung on the fence outside the building. It did not have a word written on it. Only a large black rose decorated the sign. Inside the Black Rose Guild however, all was not peaceful.
Crack….Crack..Crack...Crack
A servant who was dutifully attending the necessary duties of watching the life slips suddenly jumped up upon hearing the cracking sound. Rushing over to the slots on the wall he saw one of the jade slips that was underneath a Rank 3 mission was cracked, meaning the person had died.
As the servant rushed to see who the mission belonged to three more cracks rang out within seconds. Turning, the servant saw, to his dismay, it was the other three slips under the mission.
After finding out who it was that ordered the mission he quickly went up to their office. Knock Knock. “Come in.” A rough voice called out to the servant.
Walking in the servant quickly bowed. A large fat man sat in the chair watching the man with beady eyes. The servant waited, head still bowed not daring to look up. The fat man frowned at this.
Reaching out with the cane beside his desk he tapped the servant on the shoulder. “Hey. I’m not going to blame you for the news, so don’t act so terrified. Now speak up. What did you come to tell me.”
The servant let out a hidden breath. So long as this man gave you his word, nothing would happen. He cared too much about face to go back for a mere servant. He raised his head. “All four of the Hell Squad, Murder, Slaughter, Reaper, and Slayer, have been killed on a three star mission to collect information.”
The fat man frowned. “Remind me of the particulars.” He looked at the servant with a harsh glare. “I assume you did that before stepping into this office.”
The servant nodded. “Of course sir. This was previously a one star mission to collect information on a new forging technique. Two young boys started making fake limbs such as arms, legs, and eyes. A forger named Lai Den became interested in such techniques since he was forging a puppet.”
“So he sent us a mission request. The boy was only at the Martial Student stage but unfortunately he fixed the Agata Family’s crippled boy. So when Slaughter tried to get information from him, it was at the same time that old monster came to thank the boys for helping his grandson.”
“It became a three star because of the possible Agata family support. But Slaughter took his Hell Squad so we assumed there would be no problems. But their life slips have cracked. That is the end of the report.” The servant bowed.
The fat man waved a hand dismissing the servant. He sat there for a little bit before standing up. “Damn. I might have to send someone else, I can’t disappoint Lai Den. He forges most of our weapons we use. The main branch would not be happy if I lost him. But who could I send….”
……………………………………
Chu Shen looked at the hologram for a second before he busted out laughing. “Oh Lucas, Lucas, Lucas. You know as well as I do you can’t die unless this place is destroyed.”
Holo-Lucas shrugged. “Well I had to try. Anyways, I really did die though. My body was destroyed by Slaughter out in the forest when I went hunting. It happened about an hour ago.”
Chu Shen looked at him. “Wait you mean you really did die!?”
Lucas shrugged again. “More or less.”
………………………………..
2 Weeks Earlier
Chu Shen and Lucas bought a small store using their earnings, almost completely draining them. When they did they both used the amulets to link the bracelets to the store.
Chu Shen walked into the back room and saw Lucas opening up his skull.
“What are you doing Lucas!” Chu Shen quickly rushed up grabbed Lucas’ arm that was slowly opening his skull along a vertical seam.
Lucas pushed Chu Shen away with his other arm. “Chu Shen, I’m just moving my positronic brain into this cradle okay? It’s got a power plant, radio signals, and even better, it also has a tachyon communicator I stole from the fabber.”
Lucas pointed to a black box right beside him. Chu Shen shook his head in confusion. “Alright, what is going on.”
Lucas sighed. “You mentioned how dangerous this place is, right? Well I made this cradle to hold my brain. I am even saving scans of my brain to the fabber every ten second and deleting the old one. This way I can live digitally on the fabber if my positronic brain is destroyed. Now, using the tachyon communicator, I can control my body from millions of miles away.”
Chu Shen was dazed for a second before smiling at Lucas and giving him a big hug. “Thanks Lucas, I really don’t want to lose you.”
Lucas hugged him back for a second. Before promptly throwing him into the wall. “Enough lovey dovey, I have work to do.
…………………………………………………………………
Chu Shen nodded. “Alright, so your RC body died. We can assume it was the Black Rose Guild.”
“Correct, they even mentioned it. They were strong too. They didn’t even notice my force field. The first shot from the guy with the bow took it down too. The pistols did trap one for about two minutes and killed the other. I used the railgun to kill the other two.”
“The trapped guy sliced up my body but I had it self detonate so he died. They won’t get anything out of it since all the wreckage is gone.”
Chu Shen gave him a thumbs up. “Best thing we could have hoped for. I guess now it would be best to skip town though. We don’t want such a powerful group coming after us again.”
Lucas agreed. “Definitely. So let’s pack everything together. I think I can fabricate a jetpack though so you can make a get away.”
“Great. Let’s do it.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 86 - Skipping Town</h1>
 
“So Lucas, do you really have the materials needed to build a jetpack?” Chu Shen asked Lucas, casting a questioning glance at Lucas.
Lucas rolled his eyes, though it was hard to catch the gesture since his body was a little grainy from the hologram. “Well I was planning on building you one to begin with. I mean, you did say that only high level experts can fly. So a jetpack would be a great way to escape. So I went and bought the materials myself. Took some planning to get the plastic and some specific metals but otherwise easy.”
“The jetpack is using ionic engines to fly so all it needs is electricity to create a stream of ions for propulsion. Otherwise finding some jet fuel would be tricky. Just go to the back and find the chest labeled LZ-9.” Lucas gestured to the back towards the storage room.
In order to organize everything, they would organize everything into wooden chests. The raw materials would be placed inside and labeled. The prosthetics would be labeled as LA-10 for the left arm, RE-1 for the right eye and so forth. This way they only had to bring out the appropriate chest, put the measurements in, and then wait for the fabber to finish.
Chu Shen looked inside the chest, glimpsing some metal ores and a couple vials with liquid contained. Dragging out the chest, he placed the materials into the fabber. It whirred as Lucas brought up a design and it started working.
In less than ten minutes there was a chime. Opening it up, Chu Shen faced a squat cylinder about two feet high and a foot in diameter. It had a blunt tapered end on the top and a circular bottom.
Chu Shen looked at it for a second before looking up at Lucas. “So how am I supposed to wear it?”
Lucas shrugged. “Well, I forgot the harness. Just bring some metal and some cushions.”
Chu Shen quickly collected everything and then put the jetpack. With a simple scan and some programming to put the jetpack as the base, a basic frame was created. It looked like a curved X with the ends connecting to the jetpack. The cushions were put on the inside of the X for comfort and there was a small square on the inside and a circular insert.
Chu Shen pointed to it. “So Lucas, what is that for exactly?”
Lucas smiled. “It’s for the beast core. I used inscription ink and labeled it as ‘decal’ in the machine to create an inscription. The square is for you to carry me. I didn’t really have time to collect the materials for controls so I decided to use myself as an interface. With this I can control the jetpack directly and you can just hang on for the ride. ”
Chu Shen eyed Lucas distrustfully but eventually agreed to the plan. He just didn’t have an alternative. “Okay. Now that it’s done, let’s get going. We need to skip town before the Black Rose Guild sends someone after us.”
Chu Shen hefted the jetpack. Sticking his hands through the holes in the X, he wore it like some weird bookbag. Lucas was frantically waving his arms though. “Hey! Don’t forget me!”
Chu Shen sighed. “Well alright then.” He took off the jetpack. Storing the fabber into his spatial ring, he pulled out a lightning attribute beast core. The circular insert opened up, revealing an inscription. Placing the beast core inside, he saw the light turn red on the top.
Picking up the square box with Lucas’ positronic brain, Chu Shen placed it inside the square and then stored it inside the spatial ring. If he wore it in public, it would bring about too many questions.
Walking outside, Chu Shen swiftly left for the edge of town. Unknown to him though, was the person that followed him through the streets to the edge of town. Soon, he reached the gates of the town. Chu Shen walked towards the forest, intending to take off from there.
He had scarcely gone thirty feet into the forest when Chu Shen sensed a surge of Qi come whistling towards his back. Quickly activating the <Stars Dance> technique, he swiftly dodged the blade of Qi.
Turning around he saw a man dressed in black holding a saber facing him. The man in black pointed his blade towards him. “I am with the Black Rose Guild. Until we can complete the investigation of the death of our four agents, you are to remain in town. Return before I am forced to make you.”
Chu Shen frowned. Unexpectedly, there was a Martial Student that was following him. Granted, he was only Level 7 so it wasn’t a big deal but still. This was going to slow him down.
“I am just leaving to hunt some beast cores down. That is no business of the Black Rose Guild. Let me leave in peace, I don’t have a quarrel with you.” Chu Shen gave the man a way out.
Unfortunately, he did not recognize Mount Tai. “If you won’t go back willingly, then I will make you!” With that, the man dashed forward. Chu Shen reacted instantly and took out his hammer. Both of them became coated with Qi as the fight began. The man’s saber flashed, sending several Qi blades at Chu Shen.
Clearly this person was skilled. The Qi blades were sent in an ever tightening square, closing off any way of retreat for Chu Shen. Unfortunately for the man, Chu Shen had been training with the ‘grandmaster’ for a week in predicting the movements of his opponents.
No matter how fast the man slashed his saber, there would be gaps in the Qi. <Stars Dance> was incredibly well suited to dodging between these small gaps since it was an agility based technique.
The Qi blades soared at him, appearing inescapable. But Chu Shen’s body flickered and the energy seemed to pass through him. Suddenly he disappeared and reappeared right next to the man in black.
Chu Shen had become increasingly proficient in switching between <Comet Travels Through> and <Stars Dance>. Using <Comet Travels Through> to close the distance between him and the opponent was the best way to use the technique which was designed for fast linear movements.
His hammer coated in gray colored Qi, Chu Shen swung it at the man’s chest. The man’s face sank. They were too close and the hammer was too fast. He couldn’t dodge it, only take it head on. The man took consolation in the fact that he would undoubtedly come out on top since his cultivation was greater.
The man heard in the background a kind of high pitched whining, but before he could think too deeply, their weapons clashed. The hammer met the saber, but unexpectedly the Qi coating the saber disappeared upon contact with the Qi on the hammer.
The hammer struck the saber head on, both meeting in a physical clash. The strength of Chu Shen, which was equal to a Level 9 Martial Student, struck the man’s saber. The saber flew out of the man’s hand, splitting the webbing between his thumb and forefinger.
At the same time the man spat out a mouthful of blood, his face becoming pale. ‘What the heck is this! This force struck my internal organs without warning! How is it possible that with one blow this person managed to severely injure me! I need to get out of here otherwise, I’ll die.’
With that thought resounding in the man’s head, he turned around and ran towards the city. The man was in such a hurry, he didn’t even wipe the trickle of blood that came from his mouth.
Unfortunately, Chu Shen knew he couldn’t let this man be. This man tried to attack him and was with the same guild that killed Lucas, sort of. Shooting forward, he swung his hammer, increasing the weight of it twenty fold when it was about to hit the man.
With a loud THUD, the man was struck in his back. Folding over almost completely in half, it was obvious that the man took severe damage. The man did not make a sound though and only flew forwards, propelled by the heavy strike into a tree.
Chu Shen swung his hammer, crushing the man’s head before running deeper into the jungle. He brought out his jetpack once he was far enough away. “Lucas we need to go now. The Black Rose Guild was keeping eyes on us though I took care of it.”
Lucas, who no longer had projectors for a hologram, spoke up using the speakers on his positronic brain case. “Okay, let’s go then.” Immediately there was a whining sound from the jetpack. Within ten seconds the jetpack suddenly shot upwards.
“LUUUCAAAASSSS. A WARNING WOULD BE GOOD, OW OW OWWWW!” Chu Shen screamed as the hot ions burned his legs. His Qi covered his body, absorbing the burning hot fuel.
Lucas just cackled over the speakers. “Hehehehe. That never gets old. I guess not going with anti-gravity was a good thing.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 87 - Entering the Black Night Sect</h1>
 
“So Chu Shen, do you have a plan or are you going to fly around aimlessly?” Lucas asked with the jetpacks speakers. They had taken off less than five minutes ago and so far they were only following the road away from the mercenary city.
“Of course I have a plan.” Chu Shen huffed in exasperation. “I need to buy a map to Wildent and then go see that man who blew off your leg on accident.”
Lucas’ stunned voice shrieked out. “That LUNATIC! No! NO! I still haven’t forgiven him for blowing off my leg, that b*stard!”
Chu Shen shook his head. “Oh it wasn’t that bad. You were able to make another, though it didn’t help much since your body is ashes now. Besides, he promised to help us in repayment for all the trouble and I need a place to breakthrough.”
“Breakthrough to what?”
“To the Martial Practicioner stage of course. I need to become stronger and that is about the most I can delay. With that, I should be able to collect the materials needed to build you an improved body.”
“Alright then. The scanners on this thing are limited to radar and some cameras, so I can tell we are coming up on a town but that’s all. It is fairly large, as big as the one we just left so we should stop here. I’ll let you down not too far so you can walk in.”
“Thanks Lucas.” Chu Shen didn’t have to wait long before the town was in sight. They were among the clouds to avoid detection but the toy like houses were evidence that they didn’t steer wrong.
Lucas started diving for the forest. At first, Chu Shen wasn’t too concerned. At least, not until the forest was less than a hundred feet away with no sign of slowing down.
“LUUUCAAASSS! SLOW DOWN!”
“Hehehe. Don’t worry, your body’s pretty strong, it won’t break from just this. Fortunately I armored the jetpack so it won’t break either.”
“I HATE YOU SO MUCHHHH!” Chu Shen covered himself in Qi and covered his head with his arms. SNAP CRA-CRA-CRA-CRA-CRACK THUD. He crashed through several trees before landing heavily on the ground.
Chu Shen stumbled to his feet, feeling a bit battered. Groggily shaking his head, he finally stopped seeing spots. Lucas meanwhile, was feeling very ashamed.
“I thought he knew I was joking. Dangit man, why do you have to be so serious! I was going to slow down before we hit the tree line but how was I supposed to know you were going to store me inside the spatial ring before I even got the chance. DANGIT!”
Shaking off the impact, Chu Shen walked into town with a couple dirt marks on his clothes but no worse off than before. Buying the map and a bite to eat, he quickly left the town. He was a bit hesitant, but he still brought out the jetpack.
Unexpectedly, instead of Lucas pulling another prank, he started apologizing fiercely. At first Chu Shen was a bit stunned. It wasn’t until he paid attention to what Lucas was saying that he nodded and agreed with Lucas. Even Lucas knew when to stop a joke so his whole talk about crashing was just his blustering, nothing more.
Sighing, Chu Shen forgave him and quickly started on his way to Wildent city. Two days later they arrived. As they neared the city though, Chu Shen had Lucas bring down the jetpack.
“Why should we set down here, we are still a mile out from the city?” Lucas was puzzled. It was still pretty far, why walk when you could fly?
“Because I heard from the shop I bought the map at that Wildent city is a very prosperous trade town. It is supposed to be the third best city in the entire kingdom.”
“Oh. No wonder there was so many caravans passing by.”
“And with such a big city, there must be a lot of martial artists there. Some of them must be pretty high leveled as well. It would be bad if we were detected so it’s best to be cautious.”
“Okay.” Chu Shen stored Lucas inside the spatial ring and set out. Trekking out of the forest, Chu Shen set off across the road. He wasn’t in a hurry since he didn’t have a time limit. So he strolled off unhurriedly to the city of Wildent.
Upon arriving he went through the gates unchecked. Arriving near a food stand, he bought some kebabs since he had been flying for eight hours. Asking the vendor where the black night sect was, he was directed to the east side of town.
Arriving in front of the gates for the Black Night sect, he looked at it for a second. From what he was told when he asked for directions, this was one of the top sects in the city. The entire eastern section was taken over by the Black Night sect which managed most of the local shops.
As for the actual sect, it was located near the walls and encompassed a great deal of the mountains located near the town. Often towns and sects would locate themselves near forests or mountains.
The reason being that cultivators needed seclusion to breakthrough and these terrains made it easy to become isolated. As a result, the Black Night sect being located on the edge of town was just to have more room for cultivators and to grow resources. Each sect was like a miniature town.
“Hey you! Kid, back away. The Black Night Sect isn’t recruiting today, go home.” The guard yelled from the gates.
Chu Shen cupped his hands. “I’m sorry. I am looking for someone that sent me here.”
“Shoo kid, I’m not here to babysit.” The guard dismissed him with a bored face. However, an elbow jolted slightly. The second guard, a female coincidentally, came over to him.
“What is it sweetie, who are you looking for? You can tell big sis here.” She spoke in a crooning voice. Chu Shen just looked at her for a second before shaking his head. She was offering help, no need to refuse. Even if the source acted a bit weird.
“I don’t know the person’s name but he said to show the guards this and they would know what to do.” He fished out the token that he received from the man who took Lucas’ leg.
The guard only admired the cute thirteen year old Chu Shen’s face at first. That was, until she glimpsed the medallion. It was bronze with the symbol for Night on one end and Lin Qun on the other.
She inhaled sharply. Unexpectedly, this was a medallion belonging to an outer sect elder! She glanced at Chu Shen. So young yet he had such great connections.
“Wait here for a moment. I will go see Lin Qun about your visit. Can I have your name?” She asked politely, no longer speaking in a childish manner. The other guard was a bit puzzled until he saw the medallion. He showed shock at seeing it, but then he became a little nervous.
“He wouldn’t know my name. Just tell him the kids who were on a walk on the mountains are here. He should know who we are from that.”
The guard nodded and ran off. The first guard stood there for a second before coming over to Chu Shen. “Uh, sorry about earlier. If I had known about the medallion I wouldn’t have been so rude.”
Chu Shen nodded. “I understand. Just try and be nicer in the future. It would be bad if you offended someone too powerful because you were rude.”
The guard nodded hastily before returning to his post. It took about ten minutes but the female guard appeared again. “Follow me, he said that he wants to meet you.”
With that, Chu Shen entered the Black Night Sect.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 88 - Meeting the Leg Destroyer</h1>
 
Upon entering the sect, Chu Shen was taken to a fairly luxurious house. Inside he met the man who destroyed Lucas’ leg. The man dismissed the guard, who bowed and left for her post.
The man looked at him for a second. “I am sorry for what happened to your…… odd friend. So what can I do to make up for it young one.”
“Well, I just need a place to cultivate in peace for a while. Do you think that would be sufficient?” Chu Shen inquired.
The man laughed. “And here I was worried you would ask for some weapons or something. I am glad I did not meet someone greedy. As for arranging for a place you can cultivate peacefully, I can do that. I am one of the elders of the outer sect. I will have one of the guards show you to the house you asked for.”
The man tossed him a black medallion. “This is a guest medallion. With it, you can enter the sect but you won’t access to any cultivation resources. However, you will receive a ten percent discount on the stores we manage. The will have a sign with the Night character beside their door.”
Chu Shen bowed. “Thank you.”
“No problem. Take it as me thanking you for helping clear an inner demon.” The man called for a guard, who lead Chu Shen out to the nearby forest. At the edge was a series of small cabins.
“These are the cabins for the outer sect disciples. Your cabin is on the edge over there. If any of them bother you, show them the medallion from Lin Qun, the sect elder you met. No problems should arise if you do so.”
Chu Shen cupped his hands and bowed before heading off to his cabin. Closing the door he sighed. Taking out the jetpack, he removed Lucas’ braincase from it and set it down on the bed.
“So Chu Shen, can you take out the fabber? I was in the middle of designing my body with it.”
Chu Shen shook his head. “No. The fabber is one of the secrets we need to protect. If someone discovers it, it could have disastrous consequences. Though I doubt they would know what they have it would still be disastrous.”
A sigh came from the speakers. “Oh well, it can’t be helped. How about you put me inside the spatial ring then? I can still use the fabber in there.”
Chu Shen nodded before stopping. “Wait, I was told life couldn’t exist inside spatial rings, so how can you live there?”
“Because I am a cyborg. There is no air or food inside a spatial ring, but I don’t have to worry about that since I am not an organic.”
“Oh, great. See you later then.” Chu Shen put Lucas’ braincase back inside the spatial ring. Sitting down on the bed he decided to take a nap. Tomorrow would be when he started cultivating. For now, he was still a bit sore from the fall earlier and he couldn’t rest when he was flying.
Closing his eyes, he suddenly heard an old man's voice. “So brat, you finally came to visit eh?”
He shot up like a rocket. He was back inside the cave studded with forging items but now it also had beast cores, technological gadgets, and a couple open martial art books. Master Ti Wu faced him with a smirk.
Chu Shen looked around in confusion. “Wait. I didn’t want to come here, so why am I here?”
“Because I summoned you of course. I need you to get stronger of course. I can’t have you relaxing now.” Ti Wu beckoned him. “Come, I will take you to face the pillar warriors again.”
Chu Shen backed away. “No need. I already passed right? So I don’t need to do it again.”
Ti Wi made a ‘come forth’ gesture and Chu Shen involuntarily flew through the air towards him. Landing at his feet, Ti Wu let out a cold snort. “Of course you are not finished. I need you to pass another couple pillars in order for you to learn more martial arts.”
“Right now, the number of true martial arts you know can be counted on one hand. You should know that a martial art can boost your striking power by a hundred percent, not just let it go farther. You know two defense techniques, two movement techniques, and one attack technique.”
“But the problem arises from this confounded Voids Hand’s rules. I can’t avoid the rules they have and seven is the limit. You passed six columns so you can only choose six techniques from the library, excluding the cultivation technique I gave you to begin with.”
“So in order to learn some more techniques you need to beat some more column warriors. If you can’t do that you can do some trials. We will also start training you in combat experience by having you fight the column warriors until you die.”
Chu Shen backed up a little bit. “Uh master. I am not sure I completely agree with this plan.”
Ti Wu snorted. “Well whether you agree or not is irrelevant. As your master I am telling you that you will go through this trial. Don’t worry, you might suffer a bit but you won’t die. Now hurry up, we have work to do.”
Chu Shen disappeared with a wave of Master Ti Wu’s hand and reappeared in a cave surrounded by nine jade pillars. Ti Wu, on the other hand, appeared outside the pillars.
One of the jade pillars lit up while Ti Wu rubbed his hand in glee. A shadow with a saber and a leather breastplate appeared in front of Chu Shen while a replica of his metal hammer appeared in his hands. It was the shadow from the seventh pillar!
Chu Shen looked at the shadow. Compared to what he remembered it seemed…..different. Like it was more realistic. There was slight differences that he would not have noticed if it had not been the training Grandmaster Qin made him do. He could see slight tension in the shadows arms like it had muscles and wasn’t made of pure energy.
“By the way, I was able to use those lessons you got from that Qin guy to make these pillar warriors actual bodies. They are no longer shadow and are the exact same as a person. So now you training here will not be detrimental to your combat experience but actually helpful.”
Chu Shen shook his head. He finally got done with that workaholic Grandmaster Qin and now he had to deal with the sadistic Master Ti Wu. He really did associate with the wrong teachers.
Ti Wu grinned at Chu Shen which sent chills down his spine. “Luckily you don’t need to eat for a while since you can survive on Qi instead. So get ready, you are not going to leave here for a while.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 89 - Spies</h1>
 
In the outer disciples courtyards, all was silent. Suddenly, a door on the house on the far edge of the courtyard burst open. Chu Shen came out, looking very ragged. His stomach let out a loud growl.
Stumbling, he exited the building. “Food…..I need…...foood.” Chu Shen gasped. He quickly ran to the east side of town, leaving the sect for some of the local shops outside. Chu Shen remembered a couple restaurants that he had passed by when he went to the sect.
Slowing himself down, he noticed some very curious glances cast his way. Looking down, he saw that he still had on his clothes covered in dust from his travels. Chu Shen shrugged. He was just hungry. After all, for two weeks he had been fighting the pillar warriors with the only downtime being when he slept.
Calming himself, he stepped inside the restaurant. Looking at his rather poor clothes, he had to prove that he had money before they gave him a table. Chu Shen ate like a beast, ravenously devouring everything.
Finishing with his rather large meal, Chu Shen left for the local shops. Using up the last of his gold, Chu Shen set out for some of the other local stores to start preparing for his breakthrough.
“Get out! You! Get out of my store you filthy beggar!” Chu Shen was sent flying out of the store, landing in a heap on the side of the road. Dusting himself off he glared at the store manager.
“I have the money, you saw that. So why did you throw me out?” Chu Shen asked a little angry now.
The store manager glared back. “Because you dare ask for ten percent off! I should have known from those dusty clothes of yours. Trying to save some money for yourself. Humph! If I had a servant like you, I would have fired you a long time ago.”
“What! But you didn’t even give me chance to explain why I wanted ten percent off! It’s because I have a medallion from the Black Night Sect that gives me ten percent off on the stores they manage.”
The store manager only snorted. “Like I would believe an urchin like you would actually have a medallion like that. Get out of my sights you, you, you…..oh.” The manager, who was at first bellowing out loud suddenly stopped, staring at Chu Shen who had a black medallion glistening in his palm.
The manager looked at it for a second before glancing back at Chu Shen. “I am so sorry sir. If you had just shown that to begin with, none of that would have happened. Here, let me give you a hand. Please come in.”
Many of the people who had stopped to watch this show chuckled at the man's misfortune. If Chu Shen became displeased and reported this manager's behavior to the Black Night Sect, then he would undoubtedly be fired.
However, while Chu Shen was escorted in by the nervous manager of the store, he did not notice a couple of more covetous glances that were shot towards him. The manager of the Black Rose Guild highly valued the crafter he had. As a result, he sent out reward posters to many of the surrounding towns.
Wildent, as a very large city, was also included in this area. It only took some time to get here since the distance was very large and they didn’t have jetpacks.
Chu Shen received a new fancy pair of clothes more befitting him from the manager. He also received a twenty percent off the beast cores from the manager. Chu Shen could have bought more with the money he earned but he decided not to punish the manager.
The manager was only kicking out what he thought was a presumptuous customer, though the insults was pretty rude. It wasn’t enough to be vindictive and make him suffer too big a loss.
Chu Shen bought only what he had planned to begin with. Going to a few more stores he bought a couple more stuff including some medicinal pills. He was received a lot more graciously now that he had on some better clothes.
Traveling back to the Black Night Sect, he failed to notice the man that followed him. Once he walked into the sect, the man who was trailing him stopped. Even he did not dare try and enter the sect without permission.
The man quickly departed, heading for the Black Rose Guilds branch located in the city. Soon after, a messenger bird departed from the guild with a scroll attached to its back. The man also left, a couple gold pieces richer.
Chu Shen, however, remained ignorant to the troubles he was in. He headed back to his house, not really paying attention. Just as he put his hand on the door to walk in, a voice called out.
“Hey! Who are you exactly!? This is the residences for the outer sect disciples!” Chu Shen turned around. A kid around his age stood there glaring at Chu Shen. “I know all the outer disciples and you’re not one of them.”
Chu Shen sighed. ‘I have had enough with arrogant people. First the restaurant, then the shop, and now this. Argh!’
He turned to the kid. “I have permission from one of the elders to use this residence.”
The kid looked at him for a second before holding a hand out. Chu Shen looked at it for a second in confusion. “What. What do you want.”
The kid rolled his eyes. “I need to see your guest pass otherwise, how am I supposed to believe you were invited by an elder to stay here.”
Chu Shen nodded in understanding but internally he was screaming at the kid. Why did he have to make things difficult when Chu Shen just wanted to meditate in peace? Come on, give me some peace kid!
Chu Shen brought out the guest pass. The kid looked at it before nodding. “Okay so I guess you can stay in the Black Night Sect. But you still haven’t proven you have permission to stay here.”
Chu Shen then brought out the token given to him by the elder. The kid sighed and finally acquiesced. “Alright, I suppose your story isn’t too far fetched. Go on, I won’t stop you now.”
Suddenly one of the doors to the other houses opened, revealing a young man. “Stop making things difficult for others Cang Ming! You don’t even have any authority here!”
Cang Ming turned around and started arguing with him. “What do you mean I don’t have any authority! I have plenty auth……”
Their voices faded as Chu Shen just ignored them and walked into his cabin, shutting the door firmly behind him. The soundproof array made sure none of their voices reached him.
Chu Shen sighed. He slid down the door and just sat on the floor, resting. But his slump didn’t last long before an eager gleam appeared in his eye.
“Alright, it’s time to make a breakthrough.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 90 - Breakthrough</h1>
 
Chu Shen sat down in a lotus position. Taking out the ten beast cores he had bought, he prepared to start breaking through. He thought back on what Master Ti Wu had explained why Void constitutions were superior to all others.
In order to explain that, one must understand the cultivation process of those with other types of innate constitutions. For this explanation, Master Ti Wu had used fire constitutions as an example.
Those with a fire constitution only had to absorb fire Qi in order to advance their cultivation. They didn’t need to grow their souls since they could control their Qi without worry about a cultivation deviation, just like Chu Shen.
But it was also true they could only absorb fire Qi.The reason for this was that their body would reject any other kind of Qi. If they tried absorbing other types, it would either cause them tremendous pain.
However, people with these kinds of constitutions were both lucky and unlucky. There was always two edges to a blade. While it was true that they only had to absorb Qi that was related to their element, they also had to have increasingly stronger sources. As their body became stronger, it needed a stronger and more pure source.
For example, those at the mortal realm would easily advance when they cultivate around campfires or a candle-rich environments. However, upon breaking through they would need to find a better source like a hot spring.
Later on they would need to find volcanoes or other sources rich with natural fire Qi. Eventually even places like this would not be sufficient and they would need to find abnormal places with extreme fire. And these abnormal places would be quite dangerous, only the lucky would survive.
However, those with a Void constitution are favored greatly by the heavens. Maybe it was a result of having all of the elements, including their opposites, in one form that resulted in such a heaven-defying ability.
It was all because null Qi has the unique characteristic of being able to absorb and convert all kinds of Qi. Because of this unique feature, it surpasses all other forms of constitution. Whereas others have to search for places with extremes of their elements, those with Void Constitution only have to absorb and convert regular Qi around them.
If others knew about this they would cough up blood in shame. They had pay terrible prices to cultivate but these Void users can just cultivate like normal? No, it would be more accurate to say that all they have to do is absorb energy to cultivate. They don’t even have to go through hardship to grow their soul!
Truly a heaven defying ability. The only reason why Chu Shen wasn’t cultivating like mad was so that he could temper himself with others the same power level as him.
Otherwise he wouldn’t have enough combat experience, unlike those wily foxes who clawed their way to the top. With this Chu Shen was able to feel the dangers of death and improve his battle sense. Otherwise if the two were on even terms or even if Chu Shen only had a slight advantage, he would lose because of being outwitted and outmaneuvered.
Chu Shen started to cultivate. Circulating his Qi, he also reached his soul out to ‘grab’ Qi. Qi flooded into his dantian. Using this Qi he started directing it towards the many minor meridians located at his pores.
In order to advance to the Martial Student stage, one needed to unblock the outer meridians, which was a collection of minor meridians right under the skin.
Each tiny meridian, which numbered in the billions, was a channel that let Chu Shen’s soul out into the world to absorb Qi. It was also how Chu Shen was able to release Qi.
Each successive breakthrough would lead to an increase of Qi that could flow into or out of the body at one time and also how much could be stored inside the meridians. This led to each level increasing the amount of power one could unleash at one time and also how many times one could unleash such a move.
Chu Shen started using his Qi to unblock the meridians, pushing past and expelling the impurities located inside the meridians. It took a long time to go to each cluster of minor meridians and break through it. With one swift swoop, he broke through to level 5. As he broke through, thick stinky black slime was exuded from all of his pores.
Repeating the process he broke to level 6, then level 7. However, Chu Shen sense his stamina fading. He didn’t have enough Qi to continue this breakneck speed. Chu Shen had been conserving as much energy as possible by passively absorbing Qi to slow down the expenditure of Qi.
But the rate of Qi being used far exceeded that of Qi absorbed. He just couldn’t split his attention, or rather soul, to breakthrough and absorb Qi. Sighing, Chu Shen stopped just as he finished breaking through to level 7. He opened his eyes and looked at the beast cores surrounding him.
Chu Shen reached out his hand, covered in gray Qi. Beast cores looked like glowing crystal orbs, emitting soft glows that were different colors based upon their attribute.
Upon Chu Shen’s energy coated hand touching the beast core, the energy moved, covering the beast core in gray energy. When that happened, the gray Qi started pulsing with energy. With each pulse, the gray Qi started getting brighter and the beast core became dimmer.
After a while, the beast core became a dull, see through crystal orb. Chu Shen, who looked a little pale from Qi exhaustion, regained his color. Sighing again, Chu Shen closed his eyes and started the breakthrough process again.
The beast core he just absorbed helped him regain about 70% of his energy, enough to continue breaking through. Continuing, Chu Shen managed to breakthrough to level 8. However, now his Qi reserves were down to 12%.
Each time he broke through he would gain a surge of Qi, but this surge of Qi was miniscule compared to what his capacity was with each breakthrough. Not to mention that the energy needed to break through increased exponentially.
Chu Shen absorbed two beast cores on the same level as the one he had absorbed before. But whereas the first one increased energy by about 50%, the two combined only filled him up by 80%, increasing his Qi reserves to 92%! That was a reduction of 10%!
Using this energy, Chu Shen broke through to level 10. Upon reaching this stage he had his Qi at about 7%! This massive reduction in Qi, even when he had absorbed two beast cores, showed the amount of energy needed to clear his meridians.
Chu Shen absorbed the other five beast cores that he had placed around him. His Qi reserves increased from his 7%, to 51%. He still had to breakthrough to become a Martial Practitioner.
Chu Shen was in no hurry though. His breakthroughs had taken him about two days to complete. What was a couple more hours compared to that? Chu Shen was patient and slowly absorbed Qi from the surrounding area.
The Black Night Sect had a fairly large concentration of energy, making it easier to replenish his energy. With the millions of minor meridians absorbing Qi like a sponge, Chu Shen was able to replenish his Qi by the beginning of the third day.
Taking a deep breath, Chu Shen prepared to propel himself to the Martial Practitioner stage. In order to break through such a stage, he needed to open up a major meridian.
The body had 7 major meridians. The were located in the right leg, left leg, right arm, left arm, head, heart, and dantian. Chu Shen sent his Qi forth to the meridian on his left leg, like a seething wave smashing against a dam it hit the meridian.
The meridians impurities however, did not break. Chu Shen did not become discouraged, he could sense it move slightly. Repeatedly bashing into the impurities, Chu Shen worked at the meridian.
He lost track of just how many times he smashed into that meridian. But it eventually broke. When it did, Chu Shen felt a new surge of Qi come into his body. This surge nourished his dantian, causing it to expand slightly. However, it was not as much as he had expected.
At the same time, Chu Shen realized there was an issue with this new channel for Qi. He could sense a great energy just outside his reach and that what he received so far was just a trickle.
It was the same as digging out a channel leading to a lake. Chu Shen already had one channel from the outer meridians connecting the lake, which was his body. But this new channel, even if it was dug, passed by the lake and all he received was what seeped through.
Chu Shen needed to force this channel to connect to his body otherwise he could not use his soul to gather energy from this channel. It would mean that although he had taken the first step into this new realm, he could not be considered a true Martial Practitioner.
Chu Shen started using his soul to drag this channel in the right direction. Unknown to him, a long time passed by as he concentrated whole heartedly on syncing his meridians together.
Eventually though, Chu Shen succeeded. With that, the major meridian successfully linked up with his internal meridians. Immediately a huge surge of Qi came gushing in, just like a river that has become cleared of blockages.
Chu Shen manipulated that energy towards his dantian. When it reached the dantian it filled up to the brim, overflowing with Qi. With a bang, the Dantian suddenly expanded. It became twice as big as it was now. The Qi in his body turned from a big pond to a small lake all at once.
Chu Shen sent his soul along the open pathway. He basked in this open feeling, like he could fly. His soul started to change, becoming…..stronger. It was an adaptation triggered by the opening of his major meridians, even if it was only the first step.
If before his soul was like a hand, dragging and manipulating Qi from the outside, it now became a multi-purpose machine. Chu Shen was able to sense Qi outside his body. He could sense the cultivation level of the people in the cabins around him.
Obviously, this was the spiritual sense that his father spoke of. The reason why cultivators could sense everything around them. Another change that occurred was the major meridian turned into a whirlpool, absorbing energy.
Chu Shen could feel the Qi he could unleash had increased. Trying it out, he formed a simple sphere of Qi in front of him. Frowning, Chu Shen stared at it for a second before coming to a conclusion.
Apparently the major meridians also allowed you to unleash Qi, but there was an issue. The major meridians passively absorbed Qi. He couldn’t stop it, at all. So when he wanted to send out Qi, he had to force his way through, like a boat traveling upstream.
Compared to the minor meridians, it was a major disadvantage. Obviously Chu Shen would not be able to massively increase his output of Qi. But every time he advanced, it strengthened his body, including the meridians.
Because of that, his body and meridians would be able to handle more Qi, letting him unleash more. As a result, he wasn’t too worried about this minor setback. Chu Shen was, however, overjoyed with another aspect of the meridians.
Because of his soul being able to go so far from his body, about 500 meters, Chu Shen could control Qi and create structures from that distance. With that, his range of combat expanded far beyond that he had before. He could send his Qi as projectiles for a thousand meters though he lost fine control if it went beyond 500 meters.
Chu Shen let out a sigh. The breakthrough process was finally over, now he had to clean off all these filthy impurities. Putting his hands on his knees, Chu Shen went to stand up. As he did though, he fell over.
Making a helpless face, Chu Shen just laid there. ‘Seriously! I thought Cultivators didn’t have to worry about their muscles falling asleep!’

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 91 - Hunting Again</h1>
 
Chu Shen stretched. Sitting in one place for two long was a bit concerning. Counting the days, Chu Shen realized he had been meditating for a whole week. Surprisingly though, he didn’t feel very hungry. After he experienced Master Ti Wu’s ‘training’, he had thought that he would have been starving.
After thinking for a bit, Chu Shen realized the difference. Before, Chu Shen was using up his Qi as a replacement for food but his Qi ran out since he couldn’t replenish it while he was training. But when he meditated, he needed to replenish his Qi, resulting in his him having a surplus of Qi.
Chu Shen sighed. Bringing out Lucas he set his braincase on the bed. “So Lucas, how is the body going?”
“Well it’s nice to know i’m remembered every once in awhile. You didn’t talk to me for THREE WEEKS! Do you have any idea how bored i’ve been? I created over fifty different body designs. FIFTY! I even started working on weaponry designs based off that book on resources you gave me!”
Chu Shen rolled his eyes, though Lucas’ bare bones braincase wouldn’t be able to pick the motion up. “I’m sorry Lucas. I needed to cultivate and I’ve been busy for a while. I was training with Master Ti Wu for two weeks and then I cultivated for a week straight. I didn’t have a lot of downtime to chat.”
“Fine, I guess you were busy with important stuff. More important than me. No hard feelings.”
“Lucaasssss.” Chu Shen whined. “You know i’m just trying this for you. Here’s what I plan to do. I ran out of money buying beast cores to breakthrough fast. So I am going to go hunting for some beasts to earn some money. Once I have enough, I plan to start forging and selling inscripted weapons. I can earn money fast with that, enough to buy the materials for your body.”
Chu Shen looked expectantly at Lucas’ braincase. There was an awkward pause as Lucas digested this. Finally, Lucas replied. “Alright, I agree with your plan. But how about you make me a couple things as well as the body. Consider it an apology.”
Chu Shen pumped his fist in the air. “Alright! So do you want to go back into the spatial ring? Or I can leave you in the house?”
“Any other options? I’m getting really bored in here.”
“No, none that I can think of.”
“Fine. I need to pick which model to go with anyways.” Lucas disappeared inside Chu Shen’s spatial ring. Chu Shen departed for the Chu Sect to find someone to recommend him a good place to hunt.
As it turns out, the Black Night Sect actually had a hunting ground at the edge of the sect where they raised Primordial Beasts. Anyone could enter, but any beast cores or pelts must be sold to the Black Night Sect and the price they were bought at was 10% less than they would go for outside the sect.
Normally this would make it less visited but to the sect disciples this was a blessing. The reason for that was they could trade in contribution points instead of money which could be exchanged for items and training areas.
To the sect this was a bonus since they could reap materials at a lower cost. It also helped train the disciples in combat. To everyone involved it was a win-win. Except those who were from outside the sect. Which was exactly why Chu Shen was mad.
“I can enter but only three times a month! And each time can only be three days at a time!? This is totally awful! But at least they told me the strongest Primordial Beast is a Class 6 beast. With that I should be able to use my spiritual sense.”
Chu Shen grumbled about all the restrictions that were placed on him when he entered. But he supposed they made sense. Only letting people enter 9 days a month restricted people so that they couldn’t over hunt the primordial beasts, even if the ones they chose repopulated quickly.
Chu Shen learned all of this after he asked the guards that managed this forest. The forest was divided into sections, with each one having an array to keep them separated. They would separate the beasts according to Class and they would restrict the cultivation level to also prevent the slaughter of beasts.
Arrays are costly to make and the result was that the highest rank Primordial Beast they could keep was a Class 8 beast. Otherwise the price would be astronomical to keep the array working.
Sending out his Spiritual Sense, Chu Shen started hunting. He was now a Martial Practitioner, the equivalent of a class 5 beast. With the highest class beast being a class 6, Chu Shen didn’t fear being found out since he could still run away from a beast at that power level.
Other cultivators could sense it when they were scanned by spiritual sense. The reason for this is that a person uses their soul to ‘perceive’ the world around them. Other cultivators could sense this using their own soul.
But if the difference in strength was too much, then they could mask their own cultivation. They could also track down those who scanned them with spiritual sense.
Chu Shen hunted for a while. Using his spiritual sense, he scanned a couple hundred meters in front of him. When he did though, Chu Shen heard a loud ROAR echo out from in front of him. All the birds within a mile took flight.
Chu Shen immediately took off running in the opposite direction. Behind him, the Cracking of trees could be heard. As Chu Shen disappeared, a large white ape could be seen running through the forest.
Opening it’s mouth, a beam of white energy shot towards Chu Shen. When that white beam shot out, the surrounding temperature immediately dropped. The very air froze around the beam, ice crystals appearing as the water in the air froze. It even started snowing.
The beam struck Chu Shen. However, the beam only seemed to disappear into the gray energy that coated his body. Seeing this, the apes eyes turned bloodshot.
ROOOOOOAAAAARRRRR
Letting out an ear splitting roar, the ape charged after Chu Shen. It was surprisingly fast for it’s size. Chu Shen was barely able to keep in front of it. The ape kept launching beams of white light at him but Chu Shen was able to block them all with minimum effort.
As a matter of fact, with each strike Chu Shen would have a burst of speed, slightly increasing the distance. Finally the ape let out a Huff that leveled a tree. With that, the ape departed into the forest.
Chu Shen let out a sigh of relief. That was a close one. If the ape had pursued him for another half-hour, he would have run out of Qi. Of course, if the ape kept on firing those ice Qi beams at him, then he would have been fine. The passive absorption of the major meridian helped a lot as well.
It had already pursued him for over three hours during which Chu Shen had to defend against constant attacks while using Comet Travels Through and Stars Dance to their highest level. The expenditure of Qi was boggling.
Chu Shen cursed the ape for making him waste so much time. It was truly unfortunate he encountered the class 6 Arctic Ape. He used a couple Qi replenishing pills to replenish a bit of energy before continuing his hunting.
Meanwhile, the Black Rose Guild had started using its connections to track Chu Shen. It would take a month and a half of travel in order for the Black Rose Guild to receive the bird's message, gather a team for the mission, and then send them to the branch office located at Wildent.
However, half that time had already passed. Chu Shen didn’t know it, but he was running out of time.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 92 - Forging Again</h1>
 
“Okay, here's your money. Now remember that you have used up your three chances to hunt here for the month. Don’t come here until next month.” The guard kindly reminded Chu Shen.
Chu Shen, who had small rips and patches of dust on his robe nodded at the guard. “Thanks, see you next month then.” With the courtesies done, Chu Shen left for his house. Once there, he changed into some cleaner clothes
“Alright, now I need to find a local forge. I should be able to rent some time there. Wait, first I need to buy the inscription ink and the materials to forge. I should be able to forge some basic swords, sabres, and a couple shields.”
Chu Shen nodded. Now that he had his plan, he just needed to execute it. Heading out, Chu Shen bought the necessary materials and asked for directions to a nearby forge.
Walking in, Chu Shen found the attendant. “Uh excuse me?”
The attendant looked up at him, blinking in confusion. “Yes? What is it?”
“Well I was wondering, this is a forge right?”
“Yes, it is. We accept custom orders if you wish to do so.”
“No. Actually, I wanted to know if I could borrow your forge so I can make some weapons.”
The attendant blinked rapidly for a second. “I…….. I’m not sure what to do. I think I need to talk to the master smith before I can make this decision. Give me a moment while I find him.”
The attendant walked through a door leading to a closed end of the shop. When the door opened Chu Shen could hear the faint ding of metal hitting metal and the shop noticeably heated up a couple degrees.
After a couple seconds, a huge man stepped into the shop, ducking to avoid hitting the doorway. The man was had his clothes covered in ash, presumably from the forge.
“So, who wants to use my forge!” The man boomed out. Chu Shen raised his hand. The man looked at him for a second before laughing. He laughed so hard that tears came out. Chu Shen only stared it him.
The man wiped a tear away. “Huh. So it’s just a brat. And I thought I might be able to hire a new forger. Go on then, leave. I don’t need an assistant right now.”
“No. I can forge artifacts all by myself. I can forge Low-Tier Martial artifacts fairly proficiently.” Chu Shen stated indignantly.
“Oh? Someone as young as you boasts about forging Low-Tier Martial artifacts? Does that mean you are an artificer?” The man said. As he did became more serious. An artificer was just too rare. If this kid truly was an artificer then he couldn’t offend him.
“Of course I can.” Chu Shen said imperiously. So many people had been arrogant and looked down upon him for so long, Chu Shen was fed up with it. Now it was his turn to be arrogant.
After a second though, Chu Shen seemed to deflate. It made him so mad when others acted arrogant. If he started doing it, didn’t that make him no better than them? Sighing, Chu Shen shrugged. No use thinking too deeply.
The man meanwhile had studied Chu Shen. Reaching out, he grabbed Chu Shen’s hand. They had slight callouses, though they were very faint. The man nodded. Seemed as though this kid did have some experience with wielding a hammer.
“Alright. I hope you can sympathize with me when I tell you that I can’t believe your story without proof. If I believed everyone that said the things you do, I would be considered a fool. So prove yourself.”
“I can give you an hour on an unused forge. If you can make a Low-Tier Martial weapon like you said, I will let you use the forge for free. But if you can’t or you damage my forge, I need you to pay me instead.”
Chu Shen nodded. It was a fair deal. If he had expected the master smith to trust such an unbelievable claim of talent without a shred of proof than all that would have proven was that the master smith was indeed a fool. “Alright, just lead me to the forge. I brought my own materials.”
The master smith nodded. “Alright. The assistant here will help you in the forge so that you aren’t distracted. You, lead this young man to forge nine. If I remember correctly, the blacksmith is taking leave for cultivation.”
The attendant who had followed the master smith back looked around for a second before pointing at himself. The man rolled his eyes. “Yes you, now go help this kid.”
The attendant didn’t say anything, only gesturing for Chu Shen to follow him. Chu Shen followed the attendant. There was a large open hall. Smoke was everywhere though most of it was billowing through the large holes on the ceiling. Obviously they were chimneys for ventilation.
The sounds of forging surrounded Chu Shen, putting him at ease. He had spent a majority of his life forging so these sounds were like a soothing lullaby to him.
Chu Shen was lead to an open room. Inside was the forge and some tools that were laid off to the side. The attendant took up a seat outside the forge while Chu Shen started laying out the materials he needed to forge. He then started mixing together the inscription ink.
Both him and the attendant said nothing about him not helping. Honestly it was Chu Shen’s way of giving face and being tactful. The real reason the attendant was here was to personally witness Chu Shen forging. Otherwise, what if Chu Shen just pretended to forge and brought out a weapon that he had bought previously?
Chu Shen started to forge, placing the metals together. Then using his Qi to manipulate the fire, he assured the even melting of the materials. Pounding out the impurities, Chu Shen repeated the steps several times. Pouring out the purified metal into the cast, Chu Shen waited for it too cool off.
Placing the finished sword on a table, Chu Shen then started the inscription process. The inscription was a simple [Burst Inscription] that stored Qi that the user could unleash all at once. Chu Shen succeeded on his first try, considering it was an inscription that he had used many times. He also used the [Hardening Inscription] to increase the sword's durability.
As Chu Shen held up the sword to inspect it, the attendant started clapping. “I am impressed. I have seen many blacksmiths as adept as you at forging, but many were already past their prime. It is inspiring to see such talent in one so young.”
Chu Shen nodded in recognition of the praise. “Well I have been forging for a long time so it is no big surprise that I can forge so good.”
“Either way it is an achievement to be proud off. Let us go see the master smith to validate the bet.”
“Yes, let’s go.” Chu Shen found the master smith pounding away on a spear. They waited for a while and soon he put the spear in water and then left it to cool. Turning, the man expressed surprise when he saw Chu Shen.
“What? What is it boy? It’s been barely over a half hour. You can’t be quitting already?” The man cocked his head, obviously questioning Chu Shen.
Chu Shen shook his head in denial. “Quite the opposite. I am already done with the forging. Here, can you inspect this sword I forged?” The attendant held the sword in his hand and gave it the master smith upon Chu Shen’s prompting.
The smith looked at it, inspecting it very closely with his eyes and spiritual sense. Qi surged into it as he inspected the inscriptions. Sighing, the smith placed the sword beside the cooling spear. Turning to Chu Shen he sighed.
“I admit, you are a great forger. Your foundations are very solid. The sword has had all the materials spread evenly throughout the entire sword ensuring there are no weak points along with there being almost no impurities.”
“Not to mention that the inscriptions have no error and match the sword exactly. Truly worthy of an artificer. If I had to rank this sword, I would say it is a Grade 3 Low-Tier Martial Weapon.”
“May I ask though, have you joined any other factions as an artificer?” Chu Shen was startled at the question before shaking his head. “Good. I have joined the Four Materials Shop. For someone with as much potential as you, they will certainly treat you well.”
Chu Shen thought about it for a second. “What kind of benefits would I receive?”
The master smith shook his head. “I don’t know. It depends upon your age, cultivation, and the best quality artifact you can make. But I know for me, I can receive 30% off on all materials along with being able to make requests. All I need to do is forge ten swords that can be turned into High-Tier Martial Weapons. And I am just a blacksmith, without being an artificer.”
Chu Shen realized, wasn’t this exactly what he needed? He needed to practice his classical forging and inscriptions, he also needed to gather the materials needed for Lucas to be reborn. Depending upon the benefits and restrictions, this should be exactly what he needed
“I will join the Four Materials Shop.”
“Okay, come with me. I will take you to join them.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 93 - Impressing Them</h1>
 
The Four Treasure Shop. A prestigious shop made up of masters of various crafts that sells materials for inscriptions, alchemy, and forging. Then there is the section for Martial Artists where all of the finished products made by their craftsmen are sold.
Those who were geniuses in the paths that supported the martial way were highly valued by the shop. The reason for this was naturally profit. By finding and nurturing young geniuses, obviously they would have a loyal crafter later.
Chu Shen was not a stranger to the Four Treasures Shop. As a matter of fact, he bought materials from them when he lived back in the mercenary city. Of course, that was only a branch shop. By coincidence, the main branch was actually located here. It was of course because Wildent was the third largest city.
The master smith and Chu Shen walked into the store. Upon entering a beautiful female attendant immediately approached them, smiling. “Hello honored customer. What may I do for you?”
The master smith took out an iron tablet with writing inscribed on it. “I, Huaga Osna, request for this young man to be tested as an artificer using my authority as an iron level smith of the Four Treasure Shop.”
The attendant was stunned for a second before adopting a serious look on her face. Glancing at Chu Shen for a moment, she then turned to face the master smith Huaga Osna.
“As an iron level smith, being above a copper and bronze members, you may request this. I will take the boy to the artificer exam area. Meanwhile, please remain here until the exam is done.”
Osna bowed his head in acknowledgment. Turning to Chu Shen he patted him on the back. “Good luck boy. Try your best on the exam, hold nothing back. The better your weapon, the better your treatment.”
Chu Shen nodded and followed the attendant. She lead him to the back and knocked on a door. “Come in.” They walked into the room. Facing them was a wrinkly old man behind a desk.
The attendant bowed to the“Iron level smith Huaga Osna has request this boy be tested as an artificer. Please allow him to take the test.” The wrinkled old man looked at Chu Shen and nodded his head.
“For one so young requesting to be tested as an artificer, I wonder how far you will go. Come here young one.” Chu Shen approached the old man. When he did, the old man pulsed Qi through his body.
“Hmm. Your bone does not lie. You are thirteen, very young to be testing as an artificer. If you pass it will show your potential and even if you don’t, to be a Martial Practitioner at such a young age means you are a once in a century genius. Go, take him to the practice arena.”
Bowing, the attendant left and took Chu Shen to another area. Here another attendant took over while the first one left for the shop area. Chu Shen was lead to a forge.
“If you have any materials you need to forge, ask me now. You must pay for any materials after the trial but if you can forge a good sword the Four Treasure Shop will buy it, allowing you to pay us back this way.”
“Thank you. Can you get me the inscription ink for five tries of the [Channelling Inscription], [Hardening Inscription] and a [Burst Inscription] also get me a…..” Chu Shen started to immediately list different metals he need along with the amounts he needed. Finally Chu Shen needed some special wood for the fuel.
The attendant merely listened while Chu Shen listed these materials but inwardly he was shocked that such a young boy was so professional. Normally only experienced smiths could rattle materials off like that.
“Let me go get the materials for you.” The attendant left but within five minutes he was back. He had none of the materials in his hands. While Chu Shen was a bit confused as to where they were, the attendant took the materials out of a spatial ring he wore.
“I will stay here to assess your forging process and to assist you if need be. Please start forging.”
Chu Shen nodded and placed the wood under the forge. Lighting up the wood, he waited until it reached a good temperature. Placing the ores on it, Chu Shen started melting them down. As he waited, Chu Shen took out a crystal. It had a strangely cold aura to it.
The crystal was foggy and gave off a kind of mist around it. Using the hammer that came with the forge, Chu Shen smashed the crystal into dust. Ice formed on the edge of the hammer. Smashing the ice by pounding the hammer on the edge of the table, Chu Shen put the crystal dust into a jade box.
Continuing with the forging now that the materials were starting to soften, he pounded the metal, driving out the impurities. Chu Shen then brought out the crystal dust and poured it into the liquid metal. Mixing the materials together, Chu Shen ensured an even mixture. He had some problems since the materials started to cool from the dust but placing it back into the forge fixed that real quick.
Next, he poured the blended metal into a cast. He had to wait for it to cool but it did not take long because of the crystal dust. Taking it out of the container, Chu Shen sharpened the sword against a grindstone. Normally he didn’t do this but to ensure the highest quality sword it was a must.
Taking out the inscription bottles, Chu Shen started to inscribe. Normally such normal inscriptions would take less than ten minutes. But this was no ordinary inscriptions. Chu Shen had practiced this before but modifying inscriptions still took longer.
After thirty minutes, the sword was done. Unlike the normal silver look steel swords had, it looked like diamonds had been encrusted on the blade. It glittered with crystalline brilliance. It gave off a cold Qi and the edge flashed, making it seem deadly.
The attendant bowed. “That was a masterful performance. It seems you are no ordinary forger. Let us take the sword to the elder. He will be able to evaluate it.”
Soon they stood in front of the elder. The elder held the sword up. Channelling Qi into it and using his spiritual sense to inspect everything in detail. Placing the sword down, the elder looked at Chu Shen in shock.
“Son, may you explain exactly what the sword is and what it’s effects are. I wish to know how the maker would describe such a sword.”
Chu Shen nodded. “Well I used several different materials which I am sure you know from looking at it. But they most significant was using Frost Crystal to give it a slight ice attribute.”
“I gave it three inscriptions. I used a hardening, channelling, and burst inscription. All three are basic inscriptions but I modified the channelling and burst inscriptions.”
“The Frost Crystal has the ability to turn Martial Qi that is channelled through it into frost Qi. Granted the frost Qi is fairly weak. But the longer you channel Qi through the Frost Crystal, the stronger the frost Qi becomes.”
“As you know the burst inscription stores Qi and then unleashes it in one blow. I modified it so that the stored Qi will continuously flow throughout the entire sword using the channeling inscription.”
“Upon martial Qi being channelled into the sword, the frost Qi will then be stored back inside the burst inscription allowing you to utilize a burst of intense frost Qi.”
“The longer it is since you used the burst inscription, the more terrifying the blow. Though it is a one use weapon and needs at least ten minutes to be truly effective.”
The elder nodded at the words Chu Shen said. “Truly a good sword. I see you did not forge a sheath for it though?”
Chu Shen looked at it, then nodded a bit sheepishly. “I kind of forget about that.”
The elder smiled at Chu Shen. “It seems like you still need some experience. In order to preserve the Frost Ore you need to have a sheath. It will also need nourishment of ice attribute treasures in order to keep its attributes.”
“Honestly all that is necessary is to dip the sword into liquid ice, a material readily available that we can line a sheath with. Besides that, I would say the sword is a masterpiece.”
“It can be considered as a Low-Tier Martial Weapon Grade 10. It could even be considered as a Grade 1 Mid-Tier weapon but the nourishing aspect of the sword brings it down slightly.”
The elder then pulled out a steel tablet. Inscribed on it was the characters for Artificer Five Star below that was the number 13 and Chu Shen’s name. Artificers were ranked upon the inscriptions they could place on artifacts and the inscriptions upon the effects they could bring.
A five star inscription was suitable for Mid-Rank artifacts. Chu Shen looked at the tablet before looking back up at the elder. “To be honest, you should have only gotten a Bronze tablet and a four star inscription based on your skills. However, you are young and your future limitless.”
“As a result I deem you worthy of a Steel rank tablet. The tablet is your identification for the Four Treasures Shop. It will give you a thirty percent off all of our merchandise, the ability to use our forges for free, and finally the ability to request and accept missions from us.”
“Be warned that you will need to provide a reward if you do request a mission. As for the downsides. All we request is that you forge one Low-Tier weapon at the 4th grade or better each month along with selling all weapons you forge to us. Don’t worry, we will give you a fair price. We will also provide a salary for you. How does ten gold sound per month?”
Chu Shen was slightly shocked. He had heard from the master smith they treated their crafters well but the treatment was truly great. Ten gold a month for exclusive selling rights and one sword a month? Truly joining a big organization was a good idea.
With this, he should be able to make Lucas as good as new within a month! Chu Shen cupped his hands and bowed to the elder. “Thank you kind sir. I will not forget your magnanimity.”
The elder waved his hand. “No it is my pleasure to accept someone so talented into our Four Treasure Shop. With this, we should soon have a seven or even eight star artificer within ten years. You said it was Huaga Osna that recommended you? Well, tell him he will receive a hundred gold as payment for finding a genius like you.”
Chu Shen thanked them a couple more times before going out into the shop. There the master smith waited anxiously. Upon seeing Chu Shen he rushed up to him. “So how did it go? What kind of weapon did you forge?”
“I forged a Grade 10 Low-Tier Martial Weapon.” Chu Shen said proudly, puffing his chest up a little bit.
The master smith grinned. “Great news, great news. Show me your tablet, quickly!”
Chu Shen brought out the steel tablet. Immediately the master smith was shocked. “They gave you a steel one! I only have an Iron tablet, ranked one below yours. Ugh. If I was as young as you and forged as good as I do now I bet I could have gotten a silver tablet.”
“Ah, to envy youth is a privilege of the old. It is only too bad I did not have your talent. Luckily I discovered you.”
Chu Shen then told the master smith that he would be receiving a hundred gold as payment for recommending Chu Shen to the Four Treasure Shop. Immediately Huaga Osna became overjoyed! His shop earned that much money in half a year. To receive that much now was a great blessing!
Chu Shen then quietly departed for their forge, intending to start making a sheath for the sword and then more swords to earn money for Lucas.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 94 - Lucas Revives</h1>
 
Chu Shen was quite busy forging for a month. Originally Chu Shen thought that having ten gold was a lot but apparently not. For someone who could forge a Grade 5 weapon in a half hour, it was child's play to earn such money.
The master smith had been shocked at having a hundred gold and commented how it took half a year to make that amount. The gold Chu Shen earned in this month was over two hundred gold alone. As for the reason, it was simple. Chu Shen was an artificer.
A smith has to buy the materials and then forge the weapon. Afterwards it needs to be inscribed otherwise it can only be considered a trashy weapon and not a true weapon. Because of this a smith has to split the profit 50-50 with the inscriptionist, not to mention the cost for it.
Considering all this, if a weapon sells for 80 silver, which is how much a Low-Tier Grade 5 weapon costs, the smith would be lucky to have made a profit of 30 or even 20 silver. Truly artificing is a noble profession.
Chu Shen forged for five hours everyday. Using these five hours he would sell ten weapons making 800 silver or 8 gold everyday. Using 1 gold to replenish his materials, Chu Shen would be able to forge for the next day.
Chu Shen also spent another two hours using the library that the Four Treasures Shop allowed him authority. Since his tablets authority outweighed his true ability, some of the books were far out of his understanding. His abilities soared as he learned.
But as the saying goes, you learn more walking a thousand miles than reading a thousand books. Chu Shen spent another two hours experimenting and applying the theories that he learned from the library, using another gold to buy materials. But he was able to earn it back from the products he made.
Next he talked with Lucas for an hour, since he said he was bored. Finally Chu Shen used another hour to cultivate. With this, Chu Shen was busy for eleven hours straight. Truly working from tirelessly. With this, Chu Shen earned over 210 gold.
While Chu Shen enjoyed this leisurely lifestyle, others cursed at him for doing so.
The Black Rose Guild had successfully sent a group of four to track down and capture Chu Shen. All of them were peak Martial Practitioners being at level 10. They were one of the elite squads and were considered quite good at such a low level branch of the Black Rose Guild.
Once they arrived, they bought some room at an inn. “Come one, we need to capture that boy right away.” One of the men stood up like he was going to go looking for him right now.
“Sit down you!” One of the other men grabbed him and hauled him back into his chair. “We have eyes on him in the city. Until he leaves we cannot attack him inside the city, otherwise we will be smacking the city lord's face and our Black Rose Guild would not be able to protect us. Wait until he is outside the city, then we strike.”
The man who was pulled back into his chair huffed. “Fine. It is an accurate assessment but if this takes longer than half a month I am leaving.”
One of the other men who had not spoken yet rolled his eyes. “You always were impatient. How about you use this time to cultivate?”
“Nah, I would rather kill something. I need action.” The impulsive man sighed. “Unfortunately there really is nothing here. I hope that Chu Shen leaves the city soon.”
Meanwhile, Chu Shen exited the Four Treasure Shop’s main business center. He walked out rubbing his spatial ring. “I got all the materials Lucas told me he needed. I can’t wait to find out what he made his body like this time.”
Chu Shen walked into his house at the Black Night Sect. Taking out Lucas from the spatial ring, he placed his braincase on the bed. “So Chu Shen, you came home early. Why?”
He shrugged. “Well I finally gathered all those materials you needed. I think it’s time to make that body you were talking about.”
“Yeah. That will be great. Now bring out the fabber and start loading up the materials according to the schematics.”
Chu Shen did as Lucas said. The materials were only a very small portion of the overall materials that he had bought. Looking curiously, Chu Shen waited for the fabber to finish.
Upon looking at the finished product, he immediately became confused. It was a fairly large box with a circular dent in the top. Looking around for a bit, Chu Shen found that was all that was truly there.
“What is this thing Lucas? I thought you wanted a body?”
Lucas sighed. “Well, in order to make synthetic skin, I need some very specific materials. Unfortunately, you don’t have them since you guys don’t need polyvinyl, polyethylene, and other plastic products.”

“So I made this, a mineral scanner. You should be able to find the unrefined products in the wild and transport them here. With that I will be able to walk around like a person and not some metallic monster.”
Chu Shen nodded. Of course this made sense. In order to make synthetic skin, such plastic materials were needed but plastic was not used by martial artists since only modern factories actually used them
“So what do I need to do?”
“All you need to do is activate this thing and carry it with you when you fly. I will come with you to manage the software and also to activate the jetpack. So don’t fret, it won’t take that long.”
“Besides that, I have a couple other things I need you to make for me. You did agree to it. So go ahead and load it inside the fabber.”
Chu Shen sighed and started working. Grumbling, he muttered under his breath. “I’m not a slave. When you get out, i’m going to repay you back so much for this.”
The next day, Chu Shen departed from the city. Inside the inn, the brash man from the Black Rose Guild was sleeping soundly. All of a sudden, he was rudely shoved out of bed.
Jumping up, the man grabbed his sword from the stand. “Who dares to treat me lik-”
“Give it a rest. Come on we need to move out.” One of the other men stood in front of him, glaring at the man harshly.
“The prey is leaving the city.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 95 - Confrontation</h1>
 
“So when are we going to fly again?” Lucas asked. Currently Chu Shen was carrying his braincase under his arm. The jetpack was still stored inside his spatial ring for some reason.
“Well we still need to get far enough away so they won’t detect us from the city. There are some true powerhouses there and if we are not far enough it could spell disaster. Now shut up, there's a caravan coming.”
They waited while the large procession of wagons, guards, and merchants passed by. The animals that pulled the wagons looked like horses with scales and horns.
They were Lizard Horses, famed for their stamina and defense though their attack and speed were questionable. These traits made them the best for pulling carriages such as these.
After they passed Lucas started talking again. “So why am I not using the Holo-Drone again? It can fly you know since I don’t feel like being carried.”
“Because, what will people think of a metal flying ball? To most you might be a wondrous artifact, something that others would kill us for. And yes I know it has an invisibility mode and we already proved that I can’t see it.”
“However, we can’t guarantee that the invisibility will hold up against someone with a higher level cultivation. If they see you then, once again, it will spell disaster. Especially since they will be stronger than me.”
“Well, I think with my new toys I should be able to take care of one or two stronger martial artists.”
“This is our lives we are talking about. We can’t take such risks. Until you can prove the trustworthiness of the invisibility cloak, or it is a life and death situation, we cannot take the chance.”
“Humph. With such a sub-standard fabber, I can’t make a better cloaking system. We need to make another fabber but the materials just aren’t available without extensive searching using the mineral scanner.”
“Sorry Lucas, you are going to have to wait. We are already pushing our luck the way it is.”
“Fine.”
Meanwhile, the four man group from the Black Rose Guild followed behind them. They were mounted on Lizard Horses. While Lizard Horses were not fast or agile in combat, it was still true they were one of the best long distance mounts there was for land. All of the real elites used flying mounts.
Slowly they closed in on Chu Shen and Lucas. Soon they reached a distance of about two miles from the city. Chu Shen took out the jetpack and put Lucas in it. “Alright then Lucas, you ready to go?”
“You bet.”
As Chu Shen started to strap it on, he felt a disturbance in the force. Ahem, Qi. Reacting immediately, Chu Shen jumped backwards. An arrow streaked past him, sinking into the ground like a hot knife through butter.
Cold sweat dripped off of his forehead. Luckily he felt the Qi surging towards him otherwise he would have been hit by the arrow. He jumped into the forest nearby. It was a good thing he did too.
Four Lizard Horses reached the spot he jumped off the road within ten seconds him jumping. One of the men on the horses held a bow in his hand. The man was frowning.
“They said he was a Martial Student. No way am I buying that, no student could have sensed my arrow, let alone dodged it.”
One of the other men sighed and scratched his head. “Well, if the arrow had hit his leg like we planned, he wouldn’t have been able to flee. Seems like we need to hunt him down now. What a bother.”
The man was promptly hit upside the head by the first person who spoke. “Oh shut up. We’re getting paid for this, so do your job! Now, let’s go. Let the horses follow from a distance so they don’t get in the way. He shouldn’t have fled too far.”
Suddenly the man frowned. “Hmm. It seems like our prey isn’t that timid. Get ready boys, he scanned us so I know where he is now.” The man rubbed his hands. “Looks like this isn’t going to take as long as you thought eh?” He elbowed the second man who spoke.
“Yeah, it’s better this way otherwise it’s too much of a hassle.”
When the four men rode their horses up, Chu Shen immediately frowned. Pulling out the Holo-Drone, along with four tube-shaped objects, Chu Shen loaded Lucas’ braincase into the drone.
“Alright Lucas, you ready?”
The drone floated up a bit with only a soft blue glow along with the four tubes. “Yep. How do I look?” When he said that, a blue light shot out and seemed to scan all of them. Suddenly they disappeared from his sight.
“Great job. Now are you ready?” Chu Shen asked. Then Lucas appeared in front of him, looking the exact same as he did before he had self-destructed.
Lucas nodded. “Yep, I’m ready.”
“Good now I am going to use my spiritual sense to determine how strong they are before we fight. Be ready because they will immediately be able to find me. Tell me quick, are there any open areas nearby?”
“Yes. There is one without any animals around. But why don’t you want to fight them on the road?”
“Because if we do then some caravans may become involved. There would be too many complications. Of course if we are outclassed by them, running until I can put the jetpack on while you distract them is the best course of action.”
“Okay then, I trust your judgement. Anyways, I can get you to the clearing anytime your ready.”
Excellent. I’m scanning them now. Get ready to guide me to the clearing.” Upon scanning them Chu Shen nodded. “All four of them are Level four Martial Practitioners. Troublesome, but not enough to put us in dire straights.”
“Good.” Lucas disappeared into thin air while Chu Shen ran towards the clearing, small balls of light guiding him to the clearing. Chu Shen could hear other martial artists following him.
Reaching the clearing, Chu Shen ran to the other side before then turning around. Reaching his right hand up his left hands sleeve, Chu Shen seemed to fiddling with something. Right as he finished, they appeared.
The Black Rose Guild.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 96 - Invincible?</h1>
 
Chu Shen faced the four men while three of them walked forward slowly, leaving the one with the bow at a distance. Bringing out his hammer, the three men brought out their own weapons. Two were armed with swords while another with a spear.
Slowly they circled around Chu Shen. Everyone’s body shields appeared simultaneously, like an invisible signal was given. “Why are you attacking me? I did you no wrong.” Chu Shen asked, while facing the one in front of him.
The man grinned. “Well, I may not have a grudge with you, but someone want’s that knowledge you have. All we are doing is collecting a paycheck. Don’t worry though, we won’t kill you. Come along quietly. There is no shame for a Level 3 Martial Practitioner facing four Level 10 Martial Practitioners to surrender.”
Chu Shen did not reply but merely hefted his hammer in response. The man sighed. “Oh well, I didn’t think it would work anyways. Okay boys, we go with the first formation.”
As soon as the man finished speaking, an arrow streaked towards Chu Shen. Hurriedly bringing up his hammer, Chu Shen knocked the hammer away. But unfortunately, the attack was merely a distraction.
A wall of energy suddenly appeared between the front man and man beside him. Quickly glancing around, Chu Shen realized he was in a triangle shaped cage of energy that came to a dome, closing off all routes of escape.
The man smiled at him sadistically. “Alright then, I would surrender now. You have no chance of escaping.”
“Hey! Aren’t you supposed to capture me too?” A voice called out. Everyone's heads swiveled towards the source of the voice. Everyone could see Lucas as he stepped out of the forest and faced the captured Chu Shen.
“That’s the mortal servant. Take care of him, alive if you can.” The man who had been speaking to Chu Shen gestured towards the archer. The archer nodded and immediately lifted his bow, launching an arrow towards Lucas.
The arrow hit Lucas, flying right through him. His image distorted and then reappeared five yards away. “Come on now, you missed. Try again~.”
The archer immediately became incensed and started launching arrow after arrow. Five, ten, thirty, forty. Not a single one of his arrows actually touched Lucas.
The archer, who was at first blinded by rage, broke out into cold sweat. He had cooled off by now and realized something was off. This kid was so fast that he couldn’t even see him move. This boy was dangerous.
While the archer started trying to think, Lucas stood there watching him. “Can’t hit me?” Lucas asked. “Well if you can’t, then how about I hit you?” Lucas held up a palm. Suddenly, a beam of silver-blue energy erupted from his palm.
The beam was like several lightning bolts tangled together and shot towards the archer. Face immediately paling at the immense power he could sense, he immediately tried to dodge but unfortunately, the beam was too fast. It was already upon him before he could think.
Circulating his Qi, the archer strengthened his shield as much as possible. Unfortunately, he did not have a melee weapon to help block the attack so he had to take it on with his hands.
The lightning beam struck the archer, launching him backwards. The beam continuing striking the archer. His body shield flared up for a second before dimming and disappearing. The archer immediately screamed as the lightning beam cut through his body without resistance.
His body convulsed, his skin burning from the massive amount of energy coursing through him. A five inch hole was burned through his arm and chest. The archer was dead without a doubt.
“Huh. Guess he was just a bit too weak.” Lucas said, looking a bit disappointed. The three men were stunned by the sudden death of their companion, but they were jolted out of their shock by Lucas’ word.
“Don’t move. If you do then we will kill your friend here.” The man said. To emphasize his point, the barriers surrounding Chu Shen immediately shrunk. “We can crush him with the barrier with a single thought.”
Lucas held up a finger and shook it. “Uh uh uh. You shouldn’t do that.”
The man laughed. “And why wouldn’t I-” Immediately his head burst into a mist of blood as Chu Shen’s hammer passed through the barrier and his body shield like a hot knife through butter.
Of course Chu Shen was never captured. He just wanted to give Lucas a chance to test his toys. “Come on Lucas, let’s get this over with.”
Lucas sighed. “Well, we could give them a fighting chance you know? I still need to test out my toys.”
Chu Shen glared at him. Lucas shrugged. “All right fine.”
The two shocked companions had already started to escape. Lucas raised his hand up before suddenly bringing it down. Immediately three other beams of lightning shot out from right behind the two fleeing companions. They died, writhing in pain from the lightning.
Lucas smiled. “Well, it’s too bad the Beast Core Drones have only one shot but they are very powerful”
Chu Shen nodded. “Yeah. You seem to be invincible so long as they don’t see the holo-drone. Using the other drones to make it seem like you are shooting it from you palm was genius.”
Lucas grinned at the compliment. “Well, we should get on our way. Mind bringing out the jetpack so I can control it?”
Chu Shen shook his head. “Not yet, we need to check their bodies for loot." He went over and started to check the corpses. They didn't have a whole lot, they were from a small branch of the Black Rose Guild anyways. As a matter of fact, the only spatial ring was on the leaders body.
Lucas sighed. "They were really too poor. Anways, lets go."

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 97 - Collecting the Materials</h1>
 
Chu Shen flew in the clouds high above the ground. He held the mineral scanner in his hand. Lucas’ voice came out of the jetpack. “Nope, can’t detect it here either.”
Chu Shen sighed. They had searched for two days now and collected a small amount but they still needed more. It was tiring to search for such a long time with no rest.
“Hey wait, I detected something in the mountain over there. I’m circling back around so be ready.” Lucas informed Chu Shen.
“Alright.” The jetpack banked, turning around. The mountain in question was fairly large, one of the biggest mountains within a hundred miles. After a couple minutes of circling the mountain, Lucas spoke up.
“It’s definitely down there. Let’s get down there.” Suddenly, a loud screech echoed out. SCREEECH! Simultaneously, there was a large shockwave that hit Chu Shen and Lucas, throwing them backwards. The jetpack became destabilized from the blow.
“Hold on, I can’t keep it steady! We’re going down!” Lucas yelled at him. The jetpack started spinning, gently at first before spinning faster and faster. Chu Shen was becoming disoriented.
Chu Shen caught glimpses of the ground. It was closing fast. The jetpack wouldn’t let him slow down in time. He activated his body shield in anticipation of the impact. Waiting until the last minute so that the impact would not be so great, Chu Shen hit the ground, creating a huge crater in the ground.
Getting up, Chu Shen shook his head. “Man, what hit me? That must be some beast.” SCREEECH. Suddenly, a bird swooped down at him, catching him a glancing blow to his shoulder with it’s claws.
Chu Shen was thrown backwards, flying through the air until he hit the mountain, making a crater in the rock. The bird flew back upwards, escaping into the sky. It wheeled back around while Chu Shen was just getting back to his feet.
The portion of his body shield that covered his shoulder had cracks in it. The eagle opened it’s mouth. When it did, it spat out a blade of wind that streaked towards Chu Shen.
The wind blade was almost invisible. There was a faint blur that told where it was. Chu Shen smiled at that. His body shield may not have been good at blocking physical attacks, but energy attacks were perfect.
Chu Shen lifted his arm and blocked the wind blade. When it hit his arm, the wind blade, unexpectedly, was not absorbed by it. The windblade only seemed to have been weakened severely, striking Chu Shen’s body shield. His arm wavered slightly while Chu Shen was bewildered at not being able to absorb the attack.
Recognizing the danger he was in though, Chu Shen immediately started running away from the Screecher Eagle, as the primordial beast was called. The eagle let out a loud SCREECH and flew after Chu Shen.
Multiple wind blades flew towards Chu Shen from the eagles open mouth. Chu Shen started dodging frantically, avoiding the blurry wind blades. But after a couple hits, Chu Shen realized something.
The wind blades was actual wind that was charged with Qi. The Qi accelerated the wind into a deadly blade with the Qi supporting the attack. Chu Shen smiled when he came to this conclusion.
While the Qi charged blades were deadly to others, to him they were merely a nuisance. It removed a worry he had that these blades could ignore his null Qi. It was actually a physical attack! That was why the wind blades had an effect on him, though since he absorbed the Qi that supported, it the damage was decreased by over 70%.
With this, Chu Shen realized he was no longer in any real danger. But with this conclusion, he would only take minor damage and with the influx of Qi from the absorbed attacks, he would be able to handle it with ease. However, this new information on how Qi could be used to manipulate the physical elements like that was concerning.
The eagle continued shooting wind blades. But now, Chu Shen turned around and let the wind blades hit him at will. The eagle SCREEECHED at the fact that it’s attacks were ineffective. The eagle swooped downwards, extending its claws towards Chu Shen.
Chu Shen waited until the last second before jumping into the air and hitting the eagle in the head with his hammer. The eagle was smashed into the ground, creating a large crater. Falling, Chu Shen leapt into the crater and hit the eagle upside the head again.
The blow to the eagles head had left it disoriented. The second blow knocked the eagle out. Chu Shen looked at the unconscious eagle for a moment. Finally, he waved his hand. “Bah, I’m not hunting. So long as it learns not to mess with me, it’s best to let it be.”
Chu Shen leapt out of the crater and into the air. Withdrawing the mineral scanner, he resumed his hunt for the resources he needed. He also took Lucas out since he needed him to operate the scanner. He put Lucas inside the holo-drone since the camouflage system seemed to work well.
“Whoa! What’s with that eagle? It’s wingspan is over ten foot! That’s enormous!”
“Well it was the beast that attacked us, so I had to fight against it for a bit. Luckily it’s a class 5 beast so there was no real threat.”
“Nice! But why is it still alive? We could trade the beast core and corpse for money you know.”
“Yeah but we can earn money through forging. No need to kill if we don’t have to. Now come on, we have to collect that plastic.”
“Fine. Wait! I’m detecting the movement up here! Come on!” Lucas floated through the air as the holo-drone took off up the slope. Chu Shen sighed and ran behind him.
When they reached the top, Chu Shen was shocked. Surprisingly there was a nest! A nest of the Screecher Eagle! Upon seeing it, Chu Shen nodded. Apparently the eagle was only protecting it’s young. Sighing, he turned around.
“Come on Lucas, we still need that plastic. Let’s go.” Chu Shen smiled, feeling glad for not killing the eagle. It would still need to raise it’s young after all. Unknown to him was the much larger, Class 7 Black Hawk that was staring at him from the clouds above.
It’s great sight had caught Chu Shen coming closer to it’s nest and it was prepared to swoop down and kill him instantly. The only reason it didn’t was because it saw Chu Shen spare it’s mate, though it was confused by the flying sphere and human that appeared out of nowhere.
Humans were often greedy, killing without hesitation over a couple gold pieces. As the saying goes, beasts die for food and humans die for money. The Black Hawk had experienced this and killed many greedy humans who had attacked it’s family. But these humans were not so greedy.
The Black Hawk watched the humans climb to the base of the mountain and start digging. After a while they did a weird jig. One of them took out a black box out of the sphere thing and then into a metal object that appeared as well. Then they flew off, just like a bird.
Swooping down to his mate, he picked up here limp body and placed her inside his nest. The Black Hawk stared at the quickly dwindling image of the human. No one could tell what it was thinking.
Meanwhile, The Black Rose Guild Branch Manager just dismissed the life slip servant. Leaning back in his chair, the fat man sighed. He was just going to have to give up the mission.
The forger Lai Den and did not have the money required to raise the missions difficulty. If that was the only issue than he would have helped out to foster closer relations but there was an additional issue. There was no higher squad available to a small branch like him.
It seems as though he would have to give up and hope Lai Den did not get too upset.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 98 - Lucas Revived (For Real This Time)</h1>
 
“Alright Lucas, are you ready to start making your body?” Chu Shen asked. They had found the deposit very quickly after they found the nest. Lucas was very adept with the mineral scanner after all. Then they headed home to the fabber.
“Yep, I’m ready. I’m uploading the designs right now.” Lucas said with a smile.
Chu Shen started looking at the designs. It was a very wonderfully crafted design. The outside view was solid metal, extremely durable. Also very expensive. Of course, with the artificial skin it would look like a normal person. Or at least a giant muscular man, completely unlike the teenage Lucas before.
“So Lucas, what is this design like? What did you make exactly?” Chu Shen asked, a bit confused.
“Well, it’s very special. I used Heavy Iron Gold, which is highly magnetic, for the inside. Using electricity I can manipulate the magnetic fields at will, increasing their power by over tenfold.”
“I replaced the usual motors I had inside my last body so that it gives me far greater strength. And even better, the greater the power the greater the increase.”
“Next I used Dragon Iron, which is tremendously strong, for the internal frame and exoskeleton. Of course I also made sure it couldn’t be magnetized otherwise we could have issues. My positronic brain is supposed to go in the chest while the head contains the beast core needed for power.”
“I also modified the [Channeling Inscription] so that it releases Qi in a forcefield like way, similar to the body shield you have. Unfortunately I don’t have a way to contain it so it just wastes Qi. So until I can recreate the power of the soul, I can’t use it too much.”
“Each arm and leg has the space for over three types of beast cores. I also made it to where I can switch cores so in case they have different attributes. There is a burst and channeling inscription that leads to my palm and foot that I can activate for firing Qi.”
Chu Shen nodded before suddenly cocking his head. “Wait, I know you said that you can make inscriptions with the fabber, but how? You need to fluctuate the Qi as you put it down so if you just make the inscription pattern it won’t work.”
Lucas nodded. “Yeah but you forgot that any energy can work. A laser is a form of energy. I changed the laser scanners program so that as the inscription ink is put down, the laser hits the energy with the exact amount needed. That is how I made all the previous inscriptions.”
Chu Shen was stunned. “Well, I truly didn’t think of that. Way to think outside the box Lucas.” He gave him a thumbs up.
Lucas grinned. “Thanks. Now can you go ahead and load up the fabber with the materials? I can’t exactly do that with my body right now.” He shrugged helplessly. “I am still a hologram after all.”
Chu Shen smiled sheepishly and rubbed his neck in embarrassment. “Sorry Lucas, I’ll start right away.” He started lifting materials and putting them into the fabber.
The fabber whirred to life as it started to print out Lucas’ body. It was creepy. First a robot like frame started to come into being. Then skin started to cover it, turning it into a facsimile of a human body. Definitely creepy.
While Chu Shen was both fascinated and disgusted at the creation of Lucas’ new body, Lucas himself was staring at it with intense anticipation. It had been so long since he was able to taste food, feel the sunshine, or just touch something. He couldn’t wait until he could do so once more.
Finally, the process was done. It laid on the floor while Lucas stared at it eagerly. Lucas looked up at Chu Shen. “Hey! Would you mind putting my brain inside my body?”
Chu Shen shook his head. “You have no idea how weird that sounded. Alright, where’s the holo-drone?” The sphere of metal appeared in front of him. Opening it, Chu Shen took out Lucas’ braincase.
Going over to the body on the floor, he hesitated. How was he supposed to open it? The chest suddenly opened up, spreading into eight equal parts like a crab. The inside was very intricate. Inside though was a solid metal part in the left side of the body, opposite where a person's heart normally was.
The metal part also opened up. It was an armored shell for Lucas’ positronic brain. Chu Shen opened up the braincase and placed the gray orb that was Lucas’ brain into the android body they had made.
The armored shell closed and a second later the chest cavity closed as well. Chu Shen watched Lucas, waiting for him to stand up. But nothing happened. He wasn’t worried, Lucas was probably just testing it out.
However, once five minutes had gone by, he started to worry. “Lucas, you alright?” There was no response. Chu Shen started to panic when he thought of something. You know, he never did put a beast core inside the body, did he?
He quickly withdrew a lightning beast core and went over to the head region. The head opened in a similar fashion to the chest. Placing it inside, the inscriptions pulsed brightly once as the energy from the beast core surged through it. The inscription ink all down his body lit up a bright gold, looking like divine tattoos. Chu Shen recognized it as the channeling inscription Lucas told him about.
The inscription ink faded as the energy calmed down. Lucas suddenly stood up, towering over the five foot 2 inch kid Chu Shen with his now massive height of 6 foot nine inches.
Lucas had turned into a true giant with arms and legs as big as half a tree trunk. Lucas turned to look at Chu Shen and then smirked. Reaching out a hand, he ruffled Chu Shen’s hair.
“How’s the weather down there, short stuff?” Lucas smirked at Chu Shen.
Chu Shen glared back at Lucas. “It’s nice and shady you oak. Real smart of you to forget to put a power source in your own body.”
Lucas shrugged. “Well you’re no better. You forget to remind me. You know, if I didn’t have an internal battery, I may have died.”
“No way. So how’s the body?” Chu Shen asked.
Lucas shrugged. “I have no idea. How about you help me get used to it?”
Master Ti Wu spoke up right as Chu Shen was about to agree. ‘Wait. You need to use the <Void King> technique to increase your strength. I have stored up enough Void Qi to use it in your training.’
Chu Shen shook his head. “Unfortunately I need to train. But it shouldn’t take too long, maybe an hour. After that, we can see about sparring to get you used to that body"

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 99 - Strengthening</h1>

Lucas left their house in the Black Night sect and headed out of the sect rapidly. Of course he couldn’t be found here, he had no authority to be here. Though with Chu Shen knowing someone high up, it was unlikely there would be serious consequences.
Chu Shen sat down in a lotus position and started concentrating. Master Ti Wu floated out of the Voids Hand and behind him. His hands lit up with a greenish blue hue before being taken over an inky black Qi. His Spiritual Qi turned into Void Qi with a single thought.
“I am starting now, get ready Chu Shen.” With enough words spoken, Ti Wu shoved his hand towards Chu Shen’s chest. Immediately the Void Qi was sucked up by his meridians and circulated according to the <Void King>  technique.
He started circulating it, increasing his strength. His strength currently was around 62,000 pounds. A normal Martial Practitioner Level 1 had 50,000 pounds of strength. With each level an increase of 5,000 pounds was seen for each practitioner.
Chu Shen, however, was currently having his strength increase tremendously. His previous maximum circulations of the Void King technique was 19 and allowed his body to become like iron. But now Chu Shen was able to circulate the Void Qi more since his cultivation was stronger.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, more and more circulations until Chu Shen reached the 19th circulation. Previously this was his maximum circulation amount. However, Chu Shen was able to push past, breaking through to the third stage of the Void King technique.
The 19th circulation gave him an increase of 1955 pounds. He managed to complete a 20th circulation, increasing his strength to 2,000 pounds. Then he completed the 21st circulation. The 21st circulation was a breaking point to the third stage of the Void King technique.
The increase of strength drastically increased to 3,000 pounds. Not only that, Chu Shen’s skin and muscles started becoming harder, like ropes of steel, granting him great defense.
Once he broke through, he circulated the Void Qi 21, 22, 23, 24, all the way to the 30th circulation before he had to stop. Chu Shen was excited, but knew that to finish the 3rd stage of the Void King technique, he had to complete 40 circulations. He was still someway off.
But what had him excited was the increase of 19,500 pounds from 62,000 pounds of force, to 81,500 pounds or 40.5 tons! Remember, currently a martial practitioner of the same level only had 50,000 pounds, or 25 tons, of force! This was almost double that of a normal martial practitioner of the same level and equal to that of a martial practitioner at the seventh level!
30 was the maximum amount of times he could cycle Qi according to the Void King technique. He could repeat this amount though, until Master Ti Wu told him to stop.
He started circulating his Qi and managed to do so 2 more times before it lost it’s effects. Now his strength was at 120,500 pounds or 60.25 tons! This mean Chu Shen was now 242% stronger physically than any normal Martial Practitioner! He was actually stronger than a level 10 Practitioner! Chu Shen knew exactly what this meant.
With his Null Qi and his immense physical strength and defense, didn’t this mean he was invincible unless he encountered an overwhelming opponent? This must have been what the Five Heavenly Mountains Sect had been afraid of.
Imagine, the nullification of all abilities except to fight someone on their strong points. It would be similar to facing a charging bull while in a dead end alleyway with no way to dodge. Unless you were lucky or had great skill, you would not get away unscathed. The Void sect sure was powerful.
Master Ti Wu, on the other hand, was flabbergasted. ‘Most people need two or three years to breakthrough into the 3rd stage of the Void King technique! Truly, Chu Shen is a cultivation genius, just like I thought. ‘
Master Ti Wu sighed mentally. Suddenly he thought of something and his eyes immediately widened. ‘Wait! If he uses up so much Void Qi training, then doesn’t that mean i'm running out as well!?'
Chu Shen left the Black Night Sect. He found Lucas waiting at a nearby restaurant. It was their agreed upon spot. Then they left for the forest and sparred out there.
Lucas and Chu Shen faced each other. “So Chu Shen, you ready to get beaten?” He asked with a smirk on his face.
Chu Shen smirked back at him. “No, but it seems like you are. Come, show me how strong you are!” Chu Shen dashed at Lucas.
Lucas crouched low, gathering strength. Suddenly he leapt forward like a spring that had been released. He shot towards Chu Shen, almost catching him off guard. But Chu Shen was able to punch Lucas in the shoulder, sending him spinning backwards through several trees.
Lucas stood up amidst the splinters of one of the trees he destroyed. He grinned at Chu Shen. “Hehe. Dragon Iron lives up to its name. It barely tickled.” He charged towards Chu Shen. “Come on then! Let’s go again!”
Lucas and Chu Shen launched flurries of blows against each other. They would throw a punch while blocking the others at a speed so fast their hands were almost invisible to the naked eye.
Then, Lucas managed to land a punch on Chu Shen’s chest. He repeated the tragic accident of Lucas, flying backwards through the forest. However, he stood up with barely a mark on him. He immediately charged back towards Lucas.
It was amazing. Even with Chu Shen’s massive increase of strength, they was still evenly matched with each other. It should have been no surprise though that Lucas kept up with Chu Shen. His body was made of Dragon Iron and Heavy Iron Gold, both of which were very tough.
Chu Shen couldn’t even make a dent in his body, though he could send Lucas flying which was extremely satisfying. Then with Lucas’ electromagnetic powered muscles, he was just as strong as Chu Shen, if not a bit stronger.
The only thing that Chu Shen could do that Lucas couldn’t was pummel him with Qi from afar. So far, that was his only advantage. If Lucas got around to recreating his weapons and stocking up on beast cores than even Chu Shen would be in trouble.
Of course, Lucas would be stuck at this level of strength until he upgraded his beast cores. Otherwise, Chu Shen would advance his cultivation quickly and leave Lucas behind.
Lucas sighed as Chu Shen laid on the ground, exhausted from their fight. Chu Shen looked up at Lucas curiously. “Why are you sighing? You could have won that if you had your beast cores.”
Lucas waved his hand. “No, it’s not that. I had the same thought which is why I’m sighing. I’m going to be real busy working to recreate my equipment.”
Chu Shen nodded. "And I'm going to be busy cultivating and forging to get the money for those weapons you're making."
Both of them sighed at the upcoming dreary days.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 100 - A Month Later</h1>
 
One month. That was how long Chu Shen and Lucas spent training and preparing. Chu Shen started cultivating and forging to earn money for Lucas to create new weapons. Lucas also became busy, hunting for materials and beast cores, inventing new weapons. It became extremely hectic.
Chu Shen advanced to become a Four Star artificer, capable of making a mid-tier Martial weapon. He also cultivated to the ninth level of the Martial Practitioner stage during this time.
Lucas, on the other hand, finally started re-equipping himself. First he equipped his body with 12 beast cores in total, all of them being class 5. 3 beast cores for each of his four limbs with another lightning beast core to power himself.
There was 2 earth cores with one in each hand. There was 6 fire cores with two in each foot and one in each hand. Then there was 2 ice cores, one in his hand and one in his foot. Finally there was 2 wind cores in the other hand and foot.
Lucas was also finally able to measure his strength. Previously he had used a Class 4 electric beast core. With it, he was barely able to match Chu Shen in strength at 60.25 tons of force. But he had upgraded to a Class 5 beast core since then!
Finally, Lucas was able to compare their strength with complete accuracy. It came out to be 90 tons, or 180,000 pounds. However Chu Shen did not slack either. Remember, each time he advanced a level, he would gain 5,000 pounds of strength! So now, Chu Shen no longer had 60.25 tons but 80.25 tons or 160,500 pounds!
Meanwhile, Lucas started advancing in other areas. The reason that the drones before were only one shot items was because they had the cheapest beast cores possible, the ones without a beast spirit. As a result, they only had one shot before the beast core ran out of energy and could not recharge.
However, he was able to buy more beast cores with beast spirits inside them. With that, Lucas was able to make four beast core drones to go with the holo drone. But what Lucas made during this time was not limited to that.
He also created explosive nanites. They were extremely small and contained a powerful explosive. The way Lucas designed them to be used, they were to be scattered through the air and breathed in by the opponent. Then the nanites would explode, leaving the opponent with severe internal injuries.
Lucas recreated four primordial pistols he had previously with various cores to be used for ammo according to the situation. He gave Chu Shen two of them so that he would have a surprise weapon.
Lucas also made a railgun, since it was so effective last time. He used a class 6 lightning beast core this time and created two of them, one for him and another for Chu Shen. Obviously the railgun’s offensive capabilities would be tremendously boosted with the increase of energy.
Finally, Lucas used class 5 beast cores for the five sniper drones he made. All of them used railguns for long range fighting. After all, Lucas may now be proficient at close-combat. But for long-range combat, he needed to rely on other things like the sniper drones
Chu Shen and Lucas had some interesting spars after that. Of course, neither of them used lethal attacks like railguns or nanites. Only Qi and beast cores was used in their fights. They fought a couple times but Lucas was finally fully equipped and Chu Shen took a break from cultivating.
It was time to settle their duel properly.
Chu Shen and Lucas faced each other a hundred meters apart with their hands at their sides. Both of them stared at the other, waiting for one of them to make the first move. Lucas held his primordial pistols in each hand while Chu Shen held his as well.
Suddenly, Lucas lifted his right hand and fired a beam of ice at Chu Shen. Chu Shen immediately activated <The Stars Dance> to dodge it. Lifting up his own pistol he fired it back at Lucas.
Unlike before, it was a narrow beam that ended quickly. As Lucas and Chu Shen became more proficient with their inscriptions, they found different ways to manipulate them. For example, the channeling inscription on the primordial pistols.
It could be adjusted to fire all of the Qi inside the beast core at once. Or it could fire small portions of it, resulting in rapid fire shots with weaker power. If you could compare it to something, it would be the difference between a machine gun and a bazooka. One was a powerful weapon with one shot. The other was weaker but made up for it with continuous shots.
Chu Shen had a lightning core and an earth core. The lightning core was a powerful attack and could stun a person. The earth core trapped and slowed the opponent down.
Chu Shen fired small blasts of lightning at Lucas, hoping to short circuit Lucas. Unfortunately, Lucas suddenly flew into the air, flames exploding out of his feet.
Chu Shen frowned. “Hey no fair! I can’t fly so neither can you!” He kept up his barrage of lightning. Lucas dodged everyone of them though, flames exploding on his feet.
Lucas grinned as he returned fire with his ice and metal pistols. “What? It’s not my fault you can’t fly. Besides, you should feel honored.” Lucas suddenly fell as part of his body became extremely from the earth Qi that became attached to him.
He hit the ground with a THUD. Chu Shen smirked at him. “Oh? And why should I be honored?” He fired earth Qi at Lucas, trapping him inside an earthen shell. But Lucas merely smiled as the earthen shell exploded. Flames poured around him as he used the fire beast core in his palm to destroy the shell of earth.
Lucas fired a beam of ice from his other palm and hit Chu Shen. But the ice seemed to evaporate as he absorbed the Qi with his body shield. “Well I did take the idea from you after all. Remember, your robot at the tournament? It used the same principle.”
Chu Shen’s eyes widened in recognition. “Oh yeah. Wait Doesn’t that make you a copy cat then!” Chu Shen closed in on Lucas, covering himself in armor similar to an ancient samurais. This was the <Cancellation Armor> left behind for the Void Sect’s inheritors.
Lucas fired rapidly at Chu Shen, the metal primordial pistol managing to pierce halfway through his <Cancellation Armor> before being absorbed. This goes to show the true penetrative power of the metal attribute.
Chu Shen stored his primordial pistol and brought out his hammer, holding it with one hand. Compared to before, his hammer was no longer a pure black but streaked with a coppery gold color. Obviously Chu Shen had integrated some more metals into his living steel hammer while he was cultivating.
Lucas backpedaled as Chu Shen closed in but he put away his pistols, knowing that they truly didn’t help against this energy parasite called Chu Shen. Instead, he thrust his hand into the ground and hauled up a large hunk of rock. He hit the rock with his palm, simultaneously causing an explosion with his fire beast core.
The rock shot towards Chu Shen, becoming a deadly hail of shrapnel. A round shield with chinese characters inscribed around it appeared in front of Chu Shen at a slanted angle. Obviously this was the Universe Shield! It successfully deflected half of the rock shards. The other half continued at Chu Shen but his armor was able to handle it, though it did dull significantly.
Chu Shen swung his hammer at Lucas while Lucas swung his fist at Chu Shen. Both of them were about to hit each other when a translucent barrier appeared around them both.
Chu Shen sighed. It had only been four months since he came to this realm. Compared to the previous time of ten months in Lucas’ realm it was truly too short. Chu Shen wondered, what was the reason the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion really existed? Why did it travel between realms? Was it really just a pastime of some great expert?
“Hey Chu Shen, you got everything we need? I mean, do you have my drones, nanites, and the fabber?” Lucas called out hurriedly. He had spent a long time creating those drones and if he lost the fabber…. Well, let’s just say that it would be a sad fate indeed.
Chu Shen nodded. “Yep, I carry everything with me now. I even bought a couple extra spatial rings to do it. Don’t worry. I also used the Chains of Transportation to make an amulet leading back to the forest here. We can always come back.”
Lucas grinned. “Great. Then, let's go to the next realm already!” With that, they disappeared into thin air.
