<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 1: Memories</h1>

Clang Clang Clang
Sparks flew as a hammer repeatedly smashed into a glowing metal lump. Continuous blows struck down on the metal, not letting up for a moment. The ferocity, speed, and accuracy of the hammer’s blows showed the skill of the blacksmith.
Chu Shen absentmindedly wiped the sweat from his brow as he put the metal down into the water. Steam billowed up before the metal was onto a table by the forge. The metal was now recognizable as a throwing disk used by the nearby Lin sect to train them in the arts of ranged weapons.
Taking the disk along with the others he had already forged Chu Shen took them to the shops inscription master who would reinforce the disk with Qi.
“Chu Shen, you have the throwing disks ready?”
“Yes Master Lang, I have prepared them.”
“How is you’re cultivation coming along, I heard you reached level 8 of the man stage yesterday?”
Without replying Chu Shen set down the disks and quickly left for cup by the well in the corner. Master Lang watched him leave with a pained expression.
As he filled the cup with cool well water he reminisced about his past.
Cultivation was separated into different stages with each stage having 10 levels. There was Man, Tiger, Dragon, Student, Practitioner, Scholar, Warrior, Army, King, Emperor, Earth, Nature, World, Cosmos, Celestial, and Heaven stages. Each stage had a difference in the quality of the Qi until the Student stage.
Upon reaching the student stage you would have to unblock the meridians until the Earth stage upon which the meridians would be used to explore the natural laws of the universe.
All this simply compounded young twelve year old Chu Shen’s problems. As a kid he had enormous potential, almost to the point of disbelief. When anyone heard that he had almost reached the Tiger stage at 12 they would gasp in awe but then sigh in regret.
With his talent it would have been natural to reach the Nature or even World stage. He could never reach past the dragon stage though, simply because he had no meridians to unblock. It also did not help that his Qi was abnormal and couldn’t be used for martial arts but only for internal and bodily cultivation.
As a young kid he was treated with mixed feelings, everyone knew that one of the most prominent elders son of the Chu branch sect was a genius who had his future cut short.
Knowing he could never have the power he desired at six he threw himself into finding a suitable occupation where he could reach the pinnacle.
Upon looking Chu Shen found himself entranced with blacksmithing, where all of the weapons including the ones the elders used was forged. He knew he could be of some use by making great weapons for the sect so Chu Shen was granted the chance by Master Lang.
Chu Shen always had the heavens gift of abnormal strength, he could as a six year old pick up 80 pounds, which he used to forge. Upon finding his talent for forging Master Lang took him as his direct disciple.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 2: The Pair of Gauntlets</h1>
“Junior brother Shen, I have some scrap metal for you.”
“Okay Senior brother Lan, just leave it on the table.” Chu Lan was a disciple of the Chu Sect who often visited the shop. He would bring with him old or useless armor and weapons to be melted down into new items.
On the table was a rusted pair of gauntlets, a sword broke in two, a helm with a dent in it, and a metal dagger in perfect condition. “Was there anything interesting in this batch Senior Lan?”
“No, all this is from that old man that managed the shop down the road. He ran out of all his goods except these so he decided to leave to someplace, no one knows where.”
“I have to go prepare for the sects trials, you should too if you want to become an inner disciple.”
“…”
“Oh come on, you cannot keep being depressed like this. A frog in a well does not know the extent of the earth. There may be a treasure that can give you meridians, but unless you are a core disciple the sect wouldn’t give it to you.”
“I thank you for your advice Senior Lan, but I must forge now. Please forgive my rudeness. “ Chu Shen said abruptly as he bowed to him. As he spoke Chu Lan frowned.
“Either way consider my words carefully. Goodbye, junior brother Shen.”
Chu Shen let out a sigh of relief when he left. Grabbing ahold of the sword that was broke he started melting it down, hitting it with his hammer to drive out the impurities that had accumulated on the outside of the blade.
He continuously melted down and forged the sword into ore. Right now Chu Shen had no time to forge weapons so instead he turned the broken items into pure metal ore.
Chu Shen worked his way down the line until he had refined all but the pair of gauntlets. As he reached down to grab it Chu Shen felt his Qi resonate with the pair of gauntlets. Curious he studied the pair of gauntlets but no matter how he looked at it, it was just a rusted pair of gauntlets.
Setting the pair of gauntlets down he stared at it cautiously before a light appeared in his eyes. “Ah yes. Some artifacts you have to supply Qi to them before they work or drip blood on it.”
Doing as he had said gray colored Qi appeared in his hands about the size of a penny. Until he unblocked his meridians this was the most Qi he could use outside his body. The penny sized Qi surged towards the pair of gauntlets in a formless wave.
When it came in contact with the pair of gauntlets it sucked up the Qi and a white circle lit up on the top part of the pair of gauntlets.
“Ah finally, someone with null Qi has gotten ahold of me.” A voice said inside his head. Chu Shen looked at the gauntlets in astonishment.
“You actually have a void constitution brat?” The voice said in astonishment. “I didn’t think such a small sect would have someone like you. Consider yourself lucky then, I have decided to take you as a disciple.”
Chu Shen leaned back on the wall in astonishment. Who would have thought the gauntlets would have a soul trapped inside it and it could absorb his Qi.
Nothing else had ever been able to absorb his Qi, as a matter of fact he destroyed any other type of Qi his came in contact with, frustrating his teachers efforts in teaching Chu Shen about laying formations.
“What brat, don’t want to become a disciple of the great me? Would you rather never be able to pass the  Martial Student stage? I guarantee that without my instruction you could never pass this stage.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 3: Master</h1>

Chu Shen was stunned. An expert wanted him to be his apprentice, at least he supposed the voice that sounded like an old mans that was coming from the gauntlets was a great expert. After all, he had managed to become a soul in the gauntlets and survive. Shen had never hear of someone doing that before even in the sect. 

Hurriedly he kowtowed three times on the floor. “Yes master, this disciple hears you.” 

“Humph humph. If not for your void constitution I would not even be able to teach you. Now where am I, a forge? WHAT! You would dare to melt down the voids hand like some cheap tool!” 

Chu Shen, upon hearing the old man, as he now thought of the voice, anxiously kowtowed again saying, “I am sorry master, I am truly sorry. I had eyes but did not recognize Mount Tai.” 

“Take me away at once. No better yet, put on the gauntlets.” Hearing the stern voice and wanting to please his newfound master Chu Shen quickly put on the gauntlets. 

“Now I am going to test you, consider this punishment for trying to kill me, though I doubt you could even melt the leather.” 

“Wait master, what do you me-“ 

Inside the Chu sects best forge a young man, renowned for crafting mid-tier Dragon weapons at the tender age of twelve, collapsed on the table next to him. As bits of metal and weapons clattered on the floor, the rusty gauntlets he had on melted inside his skin. 
………………………………………………………………...

Chu Shen woke up inside a cave. “What is this place?” Chu Shen asked in wonder as he looked around the cavern. Pieces of jade, black iron, dragons teeth stone, and other various crafting goods were strewn about like trash. 

“This is your soul kid.” Chu Shen jumped as an ancient voice called out next to him. Turning his head he saw a middle aged man decked out in warriors clothes next to him. Chu Shen was curious as to why the voice sounded so old but that was not important now. 

“My soul? How is that possible and why does it look like this.?” The man rolled his eyes. 

“I am not going to say it twice to a brat the can’t hear. As to how it’s possible, it’s of course through the voids hand. It’s not called divine armor for nothing. It looks like this because the things you wish for is better items to forge with.” 

“Now listen up kid. I won’t repeat myself. I am from an ancient sect that was extremely powerful. We converted our Qi into Null Qi, this Qi can neutralize all other types of Qi, making it extremely useful in a fight.” 

“Your void constitution would have been extremely valuable to the sect simply because your body naturally cultivates Null Qi. Not only that, you will be able to strengthen your body to the extreme as well, reaching strengths so that with your bare hands you can destroy entire mountains with a single blow. “ 

“The reason you are in your soul is just the first step. Next you will be transported to the testing realm contained within the voids hand for the sects test. I will not tell you more until you get there.” 

“Master I don’t think….” 

“No! You will take this test. I have told you I would take you as a disciple but there is a catch. In order for you to be considered my true disciple you must pass.” 

“If you try and fail then you will simply learn basic techniques but if you pass or succeed above my expectations then I will grant you profound techniques that if cultivated properly can shake the heavens to its core. Let us begin” 

“Wait master.” 

“What now brat, I can’t dawdle time with idle questions otherwise my Qi will run out.” 

Chu Shen cupped his hands in apology. “I am truly sorry master, I merely wanted to ask master his name.” 

The middle aged man finally smiled, breaking his stern expression which he had kept the entire lecture. “Ah yes, I truly did overlook something didn’t I? Very well. My name is Ti Wu, elder of the Void sect. Try hard disciple, I truly hope you succeed.” 

Suddenly Chu Shen was standing in the middle of a small island about 10 meters across either way. Surrounding him was a lake of lava and at the other end was a staff stuck in another island. 

Gulp 

Chu Shen looked nervously at the surrounding lava. “I didn’t think master Wu was this crazy” he whispered. 

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 4: Trials (1) </h1>

Chu Shen looked at the lava helplessly. Even now he could feel the heat, his face was even starting crack, which startled him. 

It must be known that as the apprentice for a blacksmith he had long since gotten used to intense heat. He had never experienced his skin cracking even when his master had forged with the divine fire. This heat must be on a different level than what he had been used to during forging. 

An ancient rumbling voice boomed out all around Chu Shen, completely unlike Ti Wu. “To practice martial arts is to transcend the natural order. It is to unflinchingly march forward and to harness the power of nature. Find your path to cultivation.” 

Chu Shen flinched when he heard the voice but upon hearing the words it spoke his heart grew firm and his eyes cold. 

“I have been a genius who knew I could never reach the top, that no matter what I did it would be pointless. This is my chance to reach the peak and no matter what lies in my path I shall overcome it.” 

As Chu Shen said this he strode forward towards the lava. As he neared the edge he condensed his Qi towards his legs, helping reinforce them. He paused at the edge of the lava, his eyes searching endlessly for a hint in this desolate land of fire. 

He sighed in regret. There was nothing out there. No ropes, no hints, nothing that could help him with this challenge. Finally he accepted what he must do. He must unflinchingly stride forwards on his path. Chu Shen knew his path was  
to be unique and he must embrace without hesitation or nervousness. 

It was one thing to know what you must do and another to actually do it. Breathing deeply he once more tried to pierce the gloomy land. Taking a couple steps back he ran towards the edge of the lava pool. With a tremendous leap he sailed into the sky towards the pole. 

Unfortunately no matter how strong your courage was, it still is not enough in the face of nature. As Chu Shen reached the peak of his leap he knew he would fall short, not by much, but enough. 

Without closing his eyes he prepared for his legs to be burnt and possibly his entire body to directly turn to ash. He got closer and closer to the lava, heat radiating off it becoming unbearable. 

Then his legs touched the lava. With a splash he landed in the lava, not even two meters from his goal. Ah, such a waste.
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 5: Trials (2)</h1>

In a desolate land of fire, everything was peaceful. Then all of a sudden a hand came out of the lava. Chu Shen stood on the bottom of the lava lake, looking around in astonishment. 

‘Why did I not die?’ He wondered. ‘The lava wasn’t hot and it wasn’t deep either. Just what is going on.’ 

“Haha, I knew you were the right choice brat. “ Ti Wu appeared above him, floating like the spirit he was. 

“Teacher, what’s going on? The lava didn’t kill me.” Chu Shen said with obvious curiosity. 

“A test my dear boy, a test which you passed. A cultivator of the way of the void must have courage and confidence in oneself. If you hadn’t jumped within the time for an incense stick to burn you would have landed in real lava.” 

Chu Shen gaped at Master Wu. So this whole thing was a test of his confidence that would have killed him if he didn’t try it fast enough. Pondering over the matter Chu Shen nodded his head. 

A true test would have a consequence for failure, often on the path of cultivation a mistake meant death. This was both a test and a lesson. Do not expect anything to be easy. 

Ti Wu looked at the thinking body of Chu Shen in exasperation. “If you’re just going to sit there you’re gonna burn to death. You still have to get the staff and the lava will become real soon.” 

Chu Shen panicked, rushing towards staff. As he ran the lava clung to him like mud slowing him down. It seemed like forever and with each step the lava grew hotter. Finally he reached the island with the staff. Grinning as he saw victory in his grasp he grabbed the staff. Searing heat scorched the skin of his palm. 

“ARGHHHH” Chu Shen quickly let go of the staff, waving his and around to cool it off. 

“HAHAHAHAHAHA.” The grand elder of the Void Sect, respected since the ancient times, laughed at his disciple’s misery. 

Nursing his hand, Chu Shen glared at him. Yes, he was his master but he didn’t give Chu Shen face at all. “I know this is the test master but at least warn me.” 

Ti Wu stopped laughing for a moment and looked at him. “What, did you expect it to be easy?” Upon seeing Chu Shen’s face, full of fury and indignation he burst out laughing again. “HAHAHAH, it’s a puzzle, HAHAHA, find out the answer. HAHAHA.” 

Realizing he couldn’t take out his anger on his floating master, Chu Shen promptly ignored him. Studying the staff he stared at it intensely but nothing was abnormal with the staff. It seemed to be just a normal bamboo staff. 
‘Maybe its like the gauntlets?’ With that thought in mind he repeated what he had done with the gauntlets. Nothing happened however. 

Chu Shen thought back to the voice he had first heard. “To practice martial arts is to transcend the natural order. It is to unflinchingly march forward and to harness the power of nature. Find your path to cultivation.” 

‘Hmmm. The first part is simply a description of cultivation. The second part was the key to the first test. To “unflinchingly march forward” must be the jumping into the lava. Was the clue “Harness the power of nature”?’ 

Chu Shen shrugged.  

There was only one way to find out..... but how could he harness the power of nature? His eyes wandered around looking for something of nature. The only stuff around though was a flat black surface and lava. 

His face lit up. Grasping the desperate thought with both hands he rushed to the edge of the island and reached his hands into the lava. It had felt like mud earlier and just like mud it came up in a clump. 

Cautiously he carried over the lava to the staff and smeared it on the handle. Carefully placing his hands on the staff he waited for a couple seconds. 

Nothing happened. Overjoyed he firmly grasped the staff and yanked on it. The staff moved a little bit but no more. 
Remembering his teachers reminder that the lava would become real soon made Chu Shen reckless. 

He started frantically pulling and twisting and wiggling the staff before it finally came out. Chu Shen became impressed as he looked at the staff again. 

At the end stuck in the ground there was unexpectedly a metal spike and on the spike was dozens of miniature hooks. 

‘Ah, no wonder teacher kept laughing the more I pulled’ 

The ancient voice rumbled out once again after he had picked up the staff. “You have passed the test of courage, confidence, quick wit, usage of the elements, and finally determination. There is one more test, have faith practitioner.” 

As soon as the voice finished speaking the world became black before lighting up once more. 

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 6: Trials (3)</h1>

Blinking to clear his eyes Chu Shen looked around. He sighed. ‘Yet another cavern’ he thought dully. 
This time he was in a cave and surrounding him was columns of jade. 

‘When will this end?’ He thought. His master appeared in front of him. 

“Okay brat, you are now in the last stage of the test. While the other tests was for me to test your character this last one is crucial for your future path.” 

Ti Wu gestured behind him. “See these columns?” Chu Shen nodded. “Good. Inside these columns are formation arrays. When I activate it a phantom warrior made of heavens Qi will form.” 

“Your goal is to fight these warriors. Each column’s warrior will become stronger when you beat the previous one. There is a set of weapons over there, choose one or tell me if you want a different one.” 

Upon hearing those words Chu Shen looked over at the weapons. There was various swords, spears, armor, shields, bows, and various other bladed weapons. 

Chu Shen shook his head at all these weapons. While he had not fought often with the other disciples when he did he tried to use his brute strength as often as possible. “Master, I am not suitably trained in any of these weapons.” 

Ti Wu was stunned. “Lowly sects. You’d think they’d at least train you how to fight but nooo. I bet he can’t even swing a sword around.” Ti Wu grumbled underneath his breath. 

Raising his voice he called out to Chu Shen, “Disciple, do you have any weapon you wish to use then?” 

Chu Shen cupped his hands and bowed to his master. “Yes master, I wish to use a hammer and a sleeve crossbow.” 

Ti Wu frowned. He had never used a hammer or a crossbow before so he naturally did not have the capability of reproducing them. 

”I cannot make them so you will have to make the weapons you wish to have. They will be weapons of pure steel just like these with no inscriptions added.” 

“How do I accomplish this master?” 

“Merely imagine the weapon you wish to have and let me know when you have vividly captured the image. This is after all still an illusionary soul realm in the Voids Hand.” 

“Yes master.” Chu Shen closed his eyes and thought of a hammer. It was to be one and a half meters long, making it a medium range weapon. 

It was all metal with the hammer part being over 3/10 of a meter at the end. One end was shaped like a brick and was obviously meant for crushing, the other was a metal spike meant for stabbing into the opponent. 

The crossbow on the other hand had a wooden base. It was mounted on a metal strip with leather straps to attach it to his arm. 

The string though was made with tensile steel, making it extremely hard to notch letting the arrows reach tremendous speeds.There was a groove guiding the arrow to its target. Beside the string there was a curious device. 

It looked like a gear with a handle attached to it that faced inwards towards the person’s chest if the crossbow was worn on the left arm. Another curious thing was the arrows. They looked more like a miniature spear, they had no feathers to speak of. 

If Chu Shen was able to craft a crossbow like this it would become a true marvel in the sect. It was unfortunate that though he had the talent to accomplish this he was not experienced enough in crafting to make a crossbow like this. 
Trying his best to concentrate on these masterpieces Chu Shen called out to his master hesitatingly as his brow furrowed in concentration. “Master… I have succeeded.” 

Ti Wu looked at his disciple in disdain. In mere moments he had come up with the style of weapons that would most likely follow him throughout his life. 

“Remember that these weapons will be crucial in what I teach you, do not be hasty with their design.” Ti Wu said sternly. 

“Master….I am....really....done.” Ti Wu sighed in exasperation at his disciples helplessness. 

Ti Wu floated over towards Chu Shen until he was right in front of him. Reaching out with his hand Ti Wu touched the young boys forehead. When he did a glowing blue orb emerged from his head. 

Ti Wu then took the orb and put it inside his own forehead and closed his eyes. After a short moment he looked at the Chu Shen in astonishment. 

“He truly does have potential to be a great artificer, no wonder he was working at that place.” Ti Wu murmured to himself. Realizing Chu Shen was still concentrating hard he frowned. 

Raising his voice he called out to him. “Boy, I have already received your souls image. You may stop.” 

Chu Shen opened his eyes in relief. “Here are your weapons” With a wave of his hand the weapons Chu Shen had asked for appeared, completely as he had imagined. 

He looked at them in awe, knowing that it would be some time before he could create anything of this perfection. 
Before Chu Shen put on the weapons though he put on armor. First he put on a chest plate. After that he put on a helmet that only covered the top of his head and neck. And finally shin guards and greaves that covered a broad portion of the arms and legs though the left arm had nothing put on it. 

Carefully Chu Shen strapped the crossbow on his left arm, lacing up the straps tightly. 

Ti Wu looked at the crossbow with undisguised curiosity. “What does that gear do, as far as I know it has no purpose.” 

“Yes master. I don’t believe I can properly explain, could I demonstrate it for you instead?” 

Ti Wu waved his hand in dismissal. “Yes, yes. Just show me what it does.” 

Chu Shen bowed “As you wish master.” 

Using his right arm he strained at the gears handle. As he turned it in a half circle the metal string that had been  
notched in the teeth of the gear was pulled back as well. 

Within a matter of a half a second the metal string that someone a whole stage above him would struggle with was notched in the crossbow. 

Ti Wu gained enlightenment as to the purpose of the gear. It was to allow someone weaker to notch the crossbow. With this method you could prepare a devastating attack way above your own strength, truly formidable. 

Next Chu Shen strapped on the small quiver of metal arrow-spears, as he thought of them, around his leg like a belt. Chu Shen notched the arrow into the crossbow before picking up the hammer with both hands. 

“Are you equipped with your weapons then disciple?” 

“Yes master.” 

“Then let your final test begin!”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 7: The Pillars Warriors (1)</h1>

A serious look overcame Chu Shen’s face. He looked at the space in front of him. The leftmost pillar lit up with white light before a shadow appeared before him. 



The shadow had a short sword in one hand and a dagger in the other. With such short range weapons it was obvious that this shadow specialized in speed. 



Without giving the shadow time to react Chu Shen swung the huge hammer down like lightning. The shadow looked at the hammer and Chu Shen could have sworn he saw a smirk on its face. 



The shadow didn’t block the hammer or jump away, it merely stepped slightly to the side. Seeing this Chu Shen smiled. 



The hammer hit the ground, creating a dent in the ground. The shock wave from the powerful hit made the shadow pause. 



Chu Shen used the hammers recoil to swing the hammer in a circle sideways. Without giving the shadow any room to counterattack the hammer smashed into it, blunt side first. 



The shadow flew sideways when it was hit, flying outside of the circle of pillars. As the shadow flew out of the circle it merged with the gloominess of the surrounding air. The pillar stopped glowing. 



“Impressive, I didn’t think you actually had some skills in using the hammer” Ti Wu exclaimed. 

Chu Shen grinned at his master. As far as he knew, Ti Wu was very stingy on praise. His next sentence verified this. 



“You are actually able to use the momentum of the recoil to increase your strength. Good, good. It’s too bad you’re not able to control it very well. You also need to work on your speed.” 



Actually, it was only natural that Chu Shen was skilled with a hammer. Since Chu Shen knew that his only hope for power was through blacksmithing he had only practiced techniques that could help him during forging. 



The first martial art he had learned, quite recently too, was called <Absolute Control>. This technique let you control all aspects of your weapon. It resulted in Chu Shen being able to control the rebound of the hammer. 



This was extremely helpful during forging because of the precision needed but it had one requirement that stopped most people from practicing it. 



Tremendous wrist strength. 



Chu Shen did not have the greatest mastery over this technique, as he was just recently able to practice it and that was only with his inborn strength that Chu Shen was able to do so. 



“You’ve passed the first pillar. In order to be considered an outer disciple you must beat 3 pillar shadows. If you pass 6 pillar shadows you will be an inner disciple. If you pass all 9 pillars you would be a core disciple.” 



“What are the differences master?” Chu Shen asked. He had an idea because of his own sect but wasn’t completely sure. 



“Do you think all the pillars will be this easy? Dream on! Naturally there are benefits but I will only tell you if you earn them. Now hurry up, I grow anxious.” 



Steadying his mind Chu Shen nodded to Ti Wu. Recognizing that his disciple was ready to start, another pillar light up to the right of the previous one. 



This time the shadow warrior carried a spear. As soon as Chu Shen saw the spear he started thinking. Spears, the blade was a long range but the shaft was a short range weapon. It was the natural enemy of a mid range weapon like Chu Shens hammer. 



Shadow was cautious, keeping back from Chu Shen. It constantly made little thrusts with the spear though Chu Shen avoided all these with ease. 



Finally the shadow committed to a full blow and thrust towards Chu Shen's chest. Barely avoiding the deadly blow, Chu Shen thrust forward with the hammer, almost like he was trying to punch the shadow. 



The hammer was barely avoided by the shadow however it did not expect a dart to suddenly embed itself in its head. 

The whole point of Chu Shens thrust was not to kill it but to put it off balance. Then when it was off-guard to kill it with an arrow to the face. When the arrow hit the shadow it disappeared just like the other one. 

Ting 

A melodious bell like ring sounded out as the metal arrow landed on the ground.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 9: Failure</h1>
 
“Hahaha. I truly did pick a good disciple.”
“Its not like you had a choice master, I was the only one.”
“Did you say something brat? If so I can start the array like you are.” As he said that Chu Shen had a horrified expression over his face.
“No master! This disciple was merely commenting on how grateful he was for you picking him. It truly was a fortuitous event.” Chu Shen panicked slightly.
“Good. An unyielding tree will be snapped, only the supple reed will survive the storm. Let that be your first advice from you master.”
“Thank you master.” Thankfully his master did not pursue this matter. He shuddered at the ‘testing’ his master would make him go through if TI Wu had.
“You will probably die on this next one. Can’t wait to see it.” Ti Wu rubbed his hands in glee.
Chu Shen almost spit up blood. He was the son of an esteemed elder and a genius! People might look at him with pity but never had they hoped he’d be in pain.
Snapping his fingers, Ti Wu healed Chu Shen. Letting him get in position, Ti Wu started the array.
A shadow with a saber appeared. This one had no armor except a leather breastplate. Chu Shen kept his distance as he thought about the saber. His master had said that a saber was exceptionally good at attack but average on defense.
The reason for this was because it only had a single edge and was curved. The curve made it hard to defend against but at the same time it couldn’t parry enemy attacks as well.
Its downsides, however, would be nullified in the hands of an expert.
‘I have to end this quickly, if the shadow is as good as I expect, I can’t let it gain any momentum. I must strike now.’ As all these thoughts ran through his mind, Chu Shen took up an offensive stance.
Running towards the shadow he paused just out of its range. The shadow became a blur as it ran towards him. Jumping to the side the blade just barely missed him.
Swinging his hammer Chu Shen hoped that the shadow had over exerted itself. The hammer barely missed the shadow as it followed the momentum of its swing.
It didn’t stop the blade as it missed him but rather went with it, making the blade go even faster! It was going significantly faster but again Chu Shen dodged it. Again it spun around, building up speed.
Chu Shen repeated this cycle a few times, dodging it only for it go faster and faster. Sweat was dripping down his forehead as it kept getting harder and harder for him to dodge.
The shadow was now like a cyclone making an impenetrable storm of blades. It even sucked in the air, making a slight draft, which just enhanced the image of a cyclone. Getting desperate he shot his crossbow at the cyclone.
Impossibly a saber flashed out and deflected the arrow! Chu Shen was floored. What skill is needed to move that fast while being that accurate. It didn’t even look like the shadow was dizzy.
He couldn’t keep track of the shadows blade any longer. The cyclone suddenly appeared in front of him. A burning pain was suddenly present all over his body.
Falling to the ground he realized that the shadow had sliced him with its saber dozens of times in a matter of seconds.
Ti Wu sighed. As expected, becoming a core disciple on the first test was out of reach for Chu Shen. Waving his hand the shadow dissipated and they were back in Chu Shen’s soul cavern.
Seeing the downtrodden expression on Chu Shen’s face his heart sank. If he lost his confidence then Chu Shen could encounter many serious problems later on.
“Kid, don’t let this defeat affect your soul.” Ti Wu said seriously.
“Yes master” Chu Shen still had a defeated look on his face.
“I’m serious brat. If you let this affect you it could do incomparable damage to your future cultivation. Let me ask you this, do you focus your martial arts training on fighting.”
Startled, Chu Shen shook his head no.
“That explains it. Have you ever fought a life or death battle?”
“No master.”
“Hmm. How many battles in total have you fought brat.”
“Only two master.”
“What!” Ti Wu was shocked at his answer. Chu Shen had shown good judgment in the battles, even if he had forgotten to use all his weapons and didn’t know how to fully bring out the potential of his hammer.
“So little experience yet you could reach the trial for core disciples.” Ti Wu grumbled under his breath.
Speaking up he called out to Chu Shen. “Once you can train more in the ways of combat you can come and take the test again. However, the key to success does not lie in getting to a better cultivation stage. The shadows strengths will adapt to match your own.”
“Do you know why I made you take this test?”
Chu Shen tentatively spoke up. “Because you were mad and wanted to punish me?”
“No! It was because of the sect’s rules. For some reason the founder of the Void sect decided that the Voids Hand would contain all the martial arts and cultivation methods of the sect. Only by taking a trial will you be able to learn these things.”
“Once you pass the test the Voids Hand will imprint on you a library with all these techniques. Only a core disciple has access to the most powerful techniques and can browse at will any of them.”
“You can only practice martial arts that are available to inner disciples. I will show you how to access the library and pick a suitable technique for you. Before that though, I’m going to explain some things about your Qi.”

Chu Shen stared at Ti Wu in rapt attention. To be honest, there were two reasons why he had accepted Ti Wu as his master. The first was obvious, by following him Chu Shen would be able to break into the Emperor stage.
Only his father and the patriarch were at that level. They only knew about the higher realms because of their family’s ancestors. The Chu Sect was only a branch sect.
Even the main sect had only one Cosmos level cultivator and they were widely regarded as one of the three strongest sects in the Ji Empire.
However the second reason was even more important to Chu Shen than breaking into the higher realms. What he wanted to know was why his Qi was different than anyone else’s.
One must realize that he is still a twelve-year-old kid, curiosity about what made him different was the real driving force behind his choice. Maybe once he matured would Chu Shen realize how this would impact him.
Ti Wu looked at Chu Shen humorously for a moment before clearing his voice. A serious expression came over his face as he began speaking.
“The kind of Qi you have is called null Qi. This kind of Qi is actually a spacial attribute Qi. It’s a special Qi that rarely appears in the natural world but it conquers everything around it.”
“My sect called it null Qi because it nullifies every other type of Qi. The only kind it does not nullify is heavens Qi because it doesn’t come from this plane of existence and Qi that is inside someone’s body.”
Chu Shen nodded his head. There was something’s he didn’t quite get like spacial attribute but he could get most of it. After all since before he had started practicing martial Chu Shen had studied under his father.
He’d learned the basics of cultivation but the advanced theories and other stuff, as Chu Shen thought of it, wasn’t important. After all before this there was no hope of cultivating.
There was one thing that was troubling him. “Master, you said earlier I had a void constitution. What is that exactly?”
His masters face changed from a serious look to a contemplative one. Looking at him Ti Wu remembered something. His disciple was still a kid!
‘How much does he know about martial arts, it can’t be much. He probably knows the basics but he is quite talented for such an out of the way sect. With his constitution and still making it to the eighth level of the man stage he could actually be considered a cultivation genius!’
‘However his life experience was still lacking though he is a fast learner, as evidenced by the trial.’ With this in mind he looked at Chu Shen with new eyes.
Normally only 16-18 year olds would take the test but at 12 years old he was already an inner disciple. Even within his sect this was considered good. Of course, they never would have accepted someone of such low cultivation though the void constitution he had was an exception.
‘Its best to not let him get to arrogant though, having a big head is never good.’ Chu Shen was starting to get nervous. His master was just staring at him after he had asked what he thought was a basic question. ‘Hopefully he doesn’t decide to punish me.’
“What do you know exactly about constitutions”. This sudden question startled the nervous Chu Shen.
“What master?”
He rolled his eyes. “I asked brat what you know about constitutions.”
Chu Shen was delighted. With his condition it was labeled as a broken constitution. Because of this Chu Shen was often lectured on all the different constitutions by his father.
“Yes master. A constitution is when your born different than everyone else. It might be that you’re meridians are weird like mine or you have inborn strength like me as well. It could also be that the body has a special affinity with an element.”
Ti Wu nodded. “Its sufficient though basic. You actually don’t have inborn strength. It’s a side affect of your constitution. A void constitution is when you have an affinity with space or rather the void of space.”
“The void of space contains all the different types of Qi. The void is where everything originated from and also where everything goes in the end. Because of your affinity with the void whenever you cultivate your body turns the Qi into null Qi.”
“Your body also absorbs the energy of the void when you sleep. That’s why your body is so strong. As the harsh energies of the void penetrate your muscles and bones they strengthen them. That’s the reason why you are so strong.”
“As for you lacking meridians, its actually not true. The void is nothing and everything. It is not detectable to anyone besides someone who uses void Qi.”
“When your body absorbed the Qi of the void it stored it inside your meridians. Because of the void Qi no one could sense your meridians, hence the reason why you were said to have no meridians.”
A light lit up in Chu Shens eyes. ‘So it wasn’t because of my body lacking meridians but rather my body absorbing an undetectable Qi and storing it in my meridians.’
“Is there anything else brat? I think you’ve been passed out long enough.”
“What? What do you mean passed out master?”
“I mean when I took you into your soul realm you’re consciousness left you’re body.” Seeing his panicked look he started to reassure him. “Don’t worry. At most it’s been an hour.”
“Master I need to go back to the real world. Let me get out of my soul realm. Can’t you come back when I go to bed or something?” Chu Shen begged his master.
“Brat, you truly don’t appreciate the heavens. Your void constitution is something anyone in my sect would have killed for. Almost half their cultivation was spent converting their Qi into null Qi but here you are able to do it with even trash techniques. Ah, the heavens are truly blind.”
Chu Shen was getting desperate. “Master that is not the point. Of course I appreciate my fortune but my father may get worried if I am gone too long. I need to wake up so he doesn’t suspect anything.”
“Fine brat. Don’t tell anyone about me until we can talk later.” Waving his hand the world dissolved around him into darkness.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 11: Explanations (2)</h1>
 
A sleeping boy laid on his bed while two men looked down on him. The one right in front of his bed had an incomparably noble air about him The other had soot over his clothes.
The man with the noble air stared down at the boy. “How did this happen to my son.” He said coldly. This man was obviously Chu Bai, the elder of the Chu branch sect!
If Chu Shen was awake he would instantly recognize the other person. It was actually Master Lang! He was looking at Chu Shen with a worried expression but did not seem concerned about the killing intent that was directed towards him.
“Elder Bai, I don’t know. I went back to see why Chu Shen was not bringing in any of the orders and saw him collapsed on the floor. After that I called you and the doctor. You naturally know the rest of what happened.”
Chu Bai just stared silently at Chu Shen. After a long pause he spoke up. “If my son is permanently harmed you will pay for it. Luckily for you this will probably not happen.”
Master Lang sighed. “You know I would do anything for you brother. We have gone through many things together, I would not harm your son. You have suffered enough.” Chu Bai stayed silent as he kept his back to him.
Hesitating for a second he spoke up. “Brother, what is the exact condition of Chu Shen.”
Sighing Chu Bai looked away from his son and instead at Master Lang. “If it were anyone else I would not let them ask about my son’s condition. However, you are his master and my sworn brother so I will tell you. He is suffering from Qi exhaustion and blood essence loss, though only a small portion of blood essence was lost.”
Master Lang frowned. “Blood essence and Qi exhaustion. Those are the two signs of bonding a treasure beyond their level.” Looking up sharply at Chu Bai he waited anxiously for his response.
He nodded. “That is also my conclusion. Do you see now why I would let no one else know of his condition.”
Master Lang nodded his head. “Of course brother.”
“Good, you are dismissed.” Chu Bai stayed at Chu Shens side while Master Lang left.
He stayed at Chu Shens side for an hour before he heard Chu Shen stirring.
Chu Shen opened his eyes. He was back in his bedroom. Looking around he saw his dad looking at him with a serious expression on his face. “Hello father, what happened?”
“You don’t know do you son? Ahhh. It is only natural after all you are still a kid. Tell me my son, did you drip blood on a tool of some sort at the shop.”
Chu Shen was naturally stunned. Truly he was worthy of being an elder in that he was immediately able to recognize the signs of binding a treasure.
“Father, this….” Chu Shen was hesitating. The last thing he wanted to do was to lie to his father. However his new master had told him not to say anything about him.
This put him in quite the predicament. He wasn’t sure what to say, either he offended his father who he loved greatly, or he offended his master who could help him reach the pinnacle of martial arts.
Suddenly a voice sounded in his head.
‘Brat, you can’t keep your training a secret from your father. I truly did not expect someone of the nature stage to be here, much less that you be related to them.’
Taking a gamble he thought to Ti Wu. ‘Teacher, what should I tell him then?’
‘Tell your father that you met an expert who came to the forge. He became interested in your constitution and gave you a necklace and a cultivation method. He oversaw you bind the necklace with blood upon which you fainted and afterwards you woke up here.’
‘But Master, I don’t have a necklace. Where would I get one if he asks to see it?’
‘Brat! You think I don’t know what I’m doing! Obviously the Voids Hand can be used as a spatial device. Contained in it is a lot of great artifact’s and one of them is a necklace. I will let you use it since it has a good effect on cultivation speed.”
Now that the issue had been settled, he told his father about how a mysterious master gave him a cultivation technique and a necklace that boosts training speed.
After hearing his explanation his father simply stared at him. Chu Shen was a little nervous but waited patiently. “Son. What kind of technique is it?”
“The master said I am the only one that can use it because of my bodies constitution. He said that my constitution is extremely rare but it is also a good thing.”
Chu Bai then asked the question that weighed heavily on his mind. “With this technique, how far can you breakthrough?”
Respectfully Chu Shan replied “All I know is that with this technique, I can breakthrough past the Emperor stage.”
Chu Bai was at first hesitant to believe this. After all, the Emeror stage required the meridians to be unblocked, but now his son who had no meridians said he could reach that stage.
His father started crying. Startled Chu Shen stared at his father with some hesitation in his heart. It was the first time he’d ever seen his father cry. Even when his mother was lost he did not cry, instead he just became angry.
“Thank the heavens, thank the heavens. My son can finally reach the pinnacle of cultivation. Ah son. You may not know this but your mother was not killed but captured. I have waited so long to search for her but could not, I had to protect you. If I had tried to rescue your mother then I would have put you at risk. I couldn’t do that so I have suffered in silence all this time.”
“Son. If you can truly reach the Emperor stage then you will be able to protect yourself. With that I can be at peace when I go to rescue your mother. If you ever encounter that master again tell him he may request anything of me and I will do it in an instant!”
Ti Wu heard this inside his gauntlet and nodded in appreciation. Obviously this man knew how to appreciate kindness. Chu Shen was lucky to have such a good father.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 12: The Goal</h1>
 
“Father. Who took my mother, tell me!” Chu Shen pleaded with his father.
“I will not tell you until you unless you can reach the Earth Stage” Chu Bai was extremely firm on this point. Normally Chu Shen’s begging would have dissuaded him but this matter was far too important for him to give up on.
“But why father, I must know.” Chu Shen truly did not understand. Anyone would wish to know who had captured their family, even if they could not do anything about it.
“I know son. I will only tell you once you get strong enough, otherwise even investigating them can get you killed.”
“Father I….”
“NO. I know you are set on rescuing your mother and so am I. However you are the only descendant I have. You must survive to carry on our family legacy. Grow strong so that you may carry yourself with a straight back.”
Chu Shen stared at his father. It was the first time he had ever been yelled at by his father.
All he had ever know about his mother was that two years after he was born she had gone to visit her family in the main sect. She had gone missing on the journey there.
Grief was rending his heart in two. The only thing that kept him going was the fact that his mother was alive. A passion lit inside him unlike anything he had before.
His father had said that only when his strength was sufficient could he help save his mother. If that was the case than he would become strong!
He would turn the world upside down to help his family, even if it was the imperial family that had captured his mother he would slaughter all four of their generations.
Ti Wu was actually pleased with these events. He could tell before that Chu Shen really wanted to become strong out of curiosity and a sense of wanting to make his father proud. Now though there was a burning desire to be strong.
This desire would make Chu Shen try his hardest at cultivating, no matter what it took.
Truly only a person who was courageous was able to walk on the path to cultivation. Someone who feared for their life would never be able to travel far.
“Father. Since I can only become stronger then give me five years. Give me five years to become strong enough to go with you.”
There was the very beginnings of a killing intent present in Chu Shens aura now.
“Truly you have great ambition son and while I am anxious to go save your mother I don’t want it to be at the cost of your life.”
“Don’t take unnecessary risks. At most take ten years, that will be enough time.” Chu Bai faintly admonished Chu Shen
“Yes father. I will try me best to keep myself safe.”
“Good, good. Now that I have your promise I can tell you this. Since you are able to cultivate to the Emperor Realm, then I can send you the main sect.”
“There you will learn different martial arts and become a great cultivator.”
“It is imperative that you go because of the resources they have there. By going to the main sect you can increase your strength as fast as possible but be careful. It not unheard of that disciples die during their trails.”
“Don’t worry father. When will I go?”
“In a week the main sect will have some trials to become disciples. If you go you will definitely enter.”
“How can you say that dad, there are undoubtedly others who are much stronger than me.”
“Yes but they all had wealthy families or came from a more prominent sect. “
“The average cultivation level of the people who go there is Man stage 10. Not to mention that the people are usually around 16.”
“Thank you dad. May I be by myself? I’m still pretty exhausted.” Now that they had finally properly discussed the matter of his mom, he needed to talk to Ti Wu.
“Okay son. Rest properly, I’ll check up on you later.” With that Chu Bai left.
Immediately after he left Ti Wu appeared in front of him, just like in the spirit realm. He could be heard like a normal person instead of inside his head.
“Okay brat we can talk now.”
“Master, I know you heard all that. Will you be able to help me reach my goal.”
“Of course. Your five year goal will be hard but with the proper resources you can reach the pinnacle soon.”
“So do you agree with going to the main sect?”
“Yes I do. If your sect can send an earth stage cultivator to watch over a minor branch sect than the main sect is undoubtedly strong.”
“Yes master. Master, I wished to know if you will transfer to me the hammer and the martial techniques that you have picked for me.”
“Tonight brat, tonight. When you go to bed I will take you to the soul realm library and choose a cultivation technique for you.”

“Tonight brat, tonight. When you go to bed I will take you to the soul realm library and choose a cultivation technique for you.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 14: Successor</h1>
 
Chu Shen was curious now. “Master, why can’t I use these techniques?”
“How foolish of me. You see, you are the third person who has come to the sect with a void constitution. The first person was the founder who died before my time and the patriarch. Now you will inherit the techniques the founder left.”
“These techniques are specifically left for void constitutions and are also the strongest techniques available.”
As his master talked he led Chu Shen to the other side of the library. There were three doors there though the one on the right was padlocked.
“These doors lead to different sections of the library. The one on the left takes you to the outer disciples library. The one on the right takes you to the Core disciple’s library. Until you pass the test you cannot go into that room. The middle room is one only you can go through.”
“Go into it and see if there are any good things left by the previous patriarchs.”
“Yes master.”
Obeying his master, Chu Shen opened the door to the middle room. As he did, he felt a surge of energy pulse through his body. Suddenly a room appeared on the other side of the door.
Inside was simply three jade slips. Going in he looked at each of them. <Voids Child> (A cultivation technique that lets null Qi gather at an extremely fast speed.)
He looked at the other two. They were both defense techniques called respectively<Cancellation Armor> and <Universe Shield>. The armor was formed from null Qi and enhanced its cancellation effects. With it so long as the enemy was not of a significantly higher cultivation level it would cancel their Qi and in cases of them being of the same strength even assimilate their Qi.
<Universe Shield> worked on the same principle but with a shield that could be manipulated through the air instead of armor that could be worn. It had the advantage of being able to block attacks at long range.
These were extremely powerful techniques that could exponentially increase a cultivators strength. The other techniques in the library were powerful and could create massive waves outside of the library.
It was different however for these techniques simply because of the requirement. These ones required you to have a special constitution. This was not something you could steal but rather depended upon your luck. With this requirement only Chu Shen was suitable for these techniques.
Grabbing all three jade slips he started to walk out of the room. Bonk
Stumbling backwards he stared at the doorway in confusion. Ripples of an unfathomable black energy covered the doorway, blocking him in.
Panicking slightly he called out. “Master, master! Something’s wrong with the door!”
Ti Wu startled after hearing his disciples panicked voice. Looking up from the jade slips he was studying he immediately ran over to the door his disciple was in.
The door was wide open but he couldn’t see inside. A black barrier covered the doorway. Pounding sounds came from the inside of the doorway.
“Brat, the library would never block you unless you did something wrong. Tell me! What did you do!”
In a panicky tone Chu Shen immediately replied back. “I didn’t do anything wrong master! I came in and picked up the jade slips like you said and when I went to go back to you the library wouldn’t let met out!”
Ti Wu stared, flabbergasted at Chu Shen. Suddenly he started laughing uproariously. “Ahahahaha”
“……”
Chills ran down Chu Shens back. The only time Ti Wu had laughed was when he had punished him or when he did something stupid.
Finally Ti Wu stopped laughing. Pulling himself together he started explaining to Chu Shen his basic mistake.
“Chu Shen, you do realize that these techniques are forbidden to be shared with outsiders right?”
“Yes master, anyone would know that.”
“I will tell you something. The library stores all your memories of practicing any of the techniques in here. If you try and share it with anyone else you won’t remember how.”
“The patriarchs techniques are forbidden for anyone to learn unless they are the patriarchs successor. That is the reason why you cant get out of the library room, you have the forbidden techniques which you cant take out of the room.”
“Oh.” Chu Shen said slightly embarrassed
“Set down the jade slips and come out here.” Chu Shen put down the slips on the table and cautiously walked towards the door. The black energy barrier had disappeared once the jade slips had been set down.
He cautiously walked forward towards the doorway. Nothing happened. Chu Shen kept walking forward into the library and stopped next to his master.
“Since you have already picked out some techniques I will show you how to assimilate the techniques knowledge with you.”
“Now first you grab the technique, close your eyes, and hold it up to your forehead.”
Chu Shen waited for a couple seconds. After realizing his master wasn’t going to elaborate he grabbed one of the techniques he picked.
Holding it up to his forehead he waited for something to happen. Suddenly images and words started flashing past his closed eyes. After it was done he gasped in shock.
Searching his memory he realized that he could recall all the different steps of .
“Okay brat, now that you know what to do go ahead and assimilate all the jade slips you chose tomorrow we will train.”
Chu Shen started assimilating all the different techniques. Soon he had assimilated them all. Going into the forbidden room he assimilated those as well.
“Master I am done.”
“Good, now I will take you out of the library. Get a good nights sleep, you will have a long day tomorrow.”
The world dissolved into blackness.
Chu Shen opened his eyes. He was back in his room. Sighing he closed his eyes and went to sleep.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 16: Cheating</h1>
 
Chu Shen walked up the path leading towards the blacksmithing area. Smoke billowed upwards as the clanging of metal rang out. Chu Shen smiled.
He walked into the side of the forge. There was his teacher at the forge, a rare occurrence really. Master Lang typically left the forging to the other blacksmiths or to him.
Because Master Lang was a great inscription master he typically wrote the inscriptions for Chu Shen. After all, his Qi destroyed an inscription when he tried to write one.
His master was forging several throwing knives at once. Each blow with his hammer was extremely strange. It seemed to hit all the knives at once.
Chu Shen stared at the strange sight before smirking. Master Lang truly was worthy of being called a master artificer. There is a difference between a blacksmith and an artificer.
A blacksmith forges weapons but that is all. While they can craft miraculously sharp and strong weapons with Qi or heavenly fire, it will always be worse than an artificer’s creation.
An artificer is an inscription master and a blacksmith. An inscription is a carving laid down by an inscription master that can have various effects. One is helping channel Qi into a weapon or even increasing the Qi’s efficiency and power.
Another effect would be to transform Qi into a different type of Qi. For example, a fireball inscription when powered by martial Qi can shoot a fireball at their opponent.
With the effect of an inscription a weapons combat ability can more than triple. However an artificer is different than both an inscription master and a blacksmith master. The reason for this is actually an extremely simple reason.
An artificer is both. Because an artificer has personally crafted the weapon they lay inscriptions upon, there is no flaw. They know everything there is to know about a weapon they craft and therefore can use an inscription that perfectly suits it as well.
Each weapon has its own personality and each inscription has its own. Only the most perfect union of inscription and weapon will be able to bring out a weapons true potential.
This is why when you compare two equal weapons made by a blacksmith and inscription duo and an artificer, the artificer will always win. He frowned. Of course, since he couldn’t lay down inscriptions because of his Qi erasing the inscription ink, he could only be called a blacksmith instead of an Artificer. He would have given up long ago but this was the best thing he could do with his Qi type
A sudden stop in the clanging of metal shook Chu Shen out of his stupor. Looking up he saw Master Lang standing in front of the throwing knives. Master Lang took out a couple vials stopped with a cork
Chu Shen recognized these vials. Each inscription required materials to be made into liquid called inscription ink. Using their Qi to manipulate this inscription ink the inscription master would then make the inscription.
Master Lang unstopped the vials. A glowing blue liquid floated out of the vial. The liquid collected into several balls of liquid in front of each knife. The liquid started twisting and turning, a powerful Qi permeated the air.
The liquid formed into symbols. These symbols gave off an indescribable sense of power. Finally the symbols were complete, the glow turning golden. The leftover liquid flowed back into the vials and Master Lang stopped the vials.
The symbols hovered mysteriously in the air over the knives. Finally with a gesture of Master Lang’s hand the symbols flew down to the knives. With a flash of light the symbols turned into a circle on the knives handle.
Chu Shen mentally applauded Master Lang’s control of the inscription symbols. It was a simple inscription, basic really.
However, even the most basic inscription took a long time. Only an expert could do it in a matter of moments.
Master Lang collected the knives and put them in a basket. Turning towards Chu Shen he smiled.
“Chu Shen, get in here and start forging. The Lin sect wants some inscription throwing knives for their disciples.”
“Yes master.”
Chu Shen stepped up to another forge and started working on the knives. He grabbed some iron ore and started to forge. As he did he started circulating his Qi according to <Voids Child>  technique.
As he did golden lights started floating towards him. These lights was the Qi of the world. The Qi was only visible to those who were currently cultivating. There was a whole lot of lights, it looked like a swarm of lightning bugs.
Suddenly Chu Shen put down the hammer. He stared at his chest in befuddlement. ‘What! Since when did my cultivation speed become this fast! I previously just broke through to the 8th level of the man stage but now I almost instantly reached the middle stage. Just what is going on!’
‘Brat, that cultivation speed is just because of that technique and necklace that I gave you. Previously you were practicing a technique you were unsuitable for, now you will advance more than ten times faster!’
‘Haha, this is great! I really can reach the Emperor stage in five years’
‘I would be ashamed to call you my disciple if you didn’t do it in three.’
‘Yes master. With this cultivation speed, its practically cheating.’
“Chu Shen, keep forging. We still have to make this order.”
“En” Chu Shen nodded in his agreement.
Chu Shen picked up his hammer again. He started forging the daggers. They kept at it, each time he made a dagger his master would put an inscription on it.
Finally they finished forging all the weapons. Over 100 daggers in total were made. The inscription was a simple burst inscription. Qi would be stored in the inscription before being released on impact, creating an explosion of Qi.
It was quite formidable though it had a limit of Qi it could store. It was only useful for low-level cultivators.
Chu Shen grabbed the baskets and took them outside the forge and set them down. Chu Lan would pick them up and deliver them to the Lin sect.
Turning around he saw Master Lang was watching him.
“Chu Shen, your father told me that you are going to the main sect to join them. I have a gift for you, from master to disciple.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 17: Requesting a gift</h1>
 
Chu Shen looked at Master Lang and he looked back at him.
“Chu Shen, you are leaving for the main sect in five days time. Well actually you are not. Instead you are going to a school managed by the main sect. Prepare what you need for the journey during that time. While you prepare I need to ask you something.”
“I noticed you were having difficulty controlling your strength in the forge, why is that?”
“I am sorry master. Do you know the reason why I can go to the main sect now?”
“Yes, a mysterious expert came by and gave you an artifact and a technique.”
“The reason I am having difficulty controlling my strength is directly related to this matter. I have started training in the technique he left me and have broken through to the first stage of that technique.”
“Ah, so it increased your strength. Good, good, good. Now, I am planning on forging you some things, what do you want and I will try to make them.”
Chu Shen paused for a moment to think. He wanted a hammer similar to the one he had in the trial but with a little modification. He would have made an adjustment then but Ti Wu may have objected to that, Ti Wu had already been upset when he changed his weapon mid-trial.
He told his master what he wanted. Master Lang frowned. ‘This kid, he sure is a piece of work. He requested only two things so that isn’t problematic. The only troubling thing is that they are both complex and fickle things. This will be tough.’
Seeing a worried expression on Chu Shens face Master Lang immediately laughed. “Haha. Don’t worry, I will have these things you have requested done before you leave. What is with that glum face, do you doubt your master?”
“No master, of course not! I merely was sad that I was leaving you that’s all.”
“What, what! Have you not heard? I will be coming with you. After all, even your master has to travel every now and then.” Chu Shen was truly astounded. His master had never left the Chu branch Sect since he had come here and had actually stayed for almost 20 years.
For a cultivator to spend almost a tenth of their lifespan in one town was truly rare. Often times unless it was a main city or the capital most towns lacked resources for martial artists to train properly.
“Master, you do not have to leave with me. I do not need your protection.”
“Brat, I am not leaving just for you though if you are bullied just tell me and I will rescue you. I am going to the artificer’s guild to test my skill again, now leave. I have to start forging those weapons for you, I will be too busy once we get to the School to forge anything else for you.”
Ushering Chu Shen out he watched him walk along the path back towards his valley. Leaning against the wall of the forge he sighed. “Ahhh. Seeing him like this really takes me back. Hehe, it’s a miracle I survived all that.”
Looking up at the sky he reminisced over all the different trials he had gone through in his youth. As he did, Master Lang reaffirmed his decision to go with his disciple and become a local artificer.
An artificer is well respected and has much influence, especially someone of his level. With his status Master Lang would naturally be able to protect his disciple from most of the troublesome problems that would crop up.
Chu Shen had no idea what was going on Master Lang’s head. As he walked towards the valley he started to prepare to start cultivating again.
Suddenly a voice called out to him. “Son, I need you for a moment.”
Turning around he saw Chu Bai coming towards him.
“What is it dad, what do you need me for.”
“I just need to give you a couple things you will need for the School. You can start planning your strategy for this afterwards.”
“Yes father.”
Turning away from his valley, Chu Shen immediately followed his father back to their house. Chu Bai and Chu Shen did not say a single word on the way back but merely enjoyed each other’s company as they knew their time was limited.
They reached the house and went to his father’s storehouse. Upon reaching it Chu Bai went to the corner and grabbed a ring. It was merely a simple unadorned metal band.
He handed it to Chu Shen who looked at it in confusion. “Father, what’s this?”
“Its only natural you don’t know what this is, most people don’t use it in this little town. It’s a spacial ring. If you channel your Qi into it you will notice that it contains a space around five cubic meters in size.”
Doing as instructed he started to channel his Qi into the ring before his master stopped him. ‘WAIT!’
Cringing Chu Shen grabbed his head. ‘Master, don’t yell so loud. You are giving me a headache.’
‘I don’t care you little brat. If you had channeled Qi into that ring you would have destroyed that space with your null Qi. If you want to use that ring revolve your Qi according to this method.’
‘Oh. Thank you master.’
Ti Wu immediately passed on a basic cancellation technique not controlled by the library. Once used it actually cancelled the extra effects of null Qi.
Chu Shen immediately used the technique, after all it had no underlying concepts so it wasn’t hard at all but rather like bending your finger backwards. It was merely something you wouldn’t normally do.
Once his Qi circulated the right way he channeled it into the spacial ring. As he looked at the content he gasped. “Father this, this is.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 18: Fathers preparations</h1>
 
“Father this, this is….” As Chu Shen stammered in surprise his father raised his hands to stop him.
“Yes, this is exactly what you think.”
“But father I can’t, I just can’t accept this. This is the family heirloom. You said it was the most precious thing our branch sect owned.” As Chu Shen spoke Chu Bai kept a calm face.
“I know this naturally. However, you are the most important thing to our branch family. Objects can be replaced by other objects but talent should never be squandered. Here take this, you already know its function.” Saying so, he immediately took back the spacial ring and extracted from it a small bead on a necklace.
Chu Bai hung the necklace around Chu Shens neck. When he put it on the necklace flashed white three times before fading back to a dull black. Chu Shen grabbed the necklace and looked at it with amazement present in his eyes.
Though this necklace did not look amazing it was a true lifesaving treasure. The necklace was made using pieces of a primordial beast called the Spider of a Thousand Tricks already in the late Martial Emperor Stage. It was a well-known beast because of three things.
It used its webs to set up many traps, the higher its cultivation the trickier the traps became. It was for this reason it was called the Man Spider of a Thousand Tricks.
What it was really well known for was its two inborn abilities, which had actually been copied to a lesser extent in the necklace Chu Shen now wore.
Once the person who wore this necklace came under life threatening danger it would immediately deploy a cocoon. This cocoon was made of strings of spider webs almost completely impenetrable even to a cultivator’s weapon. Even if the shell was penetrated it would still do the attacker no good.
Upon penetration the person inside would immediately be teleported up to 1000 miles away from the spot of the attack though the spot you would be teleported to would be random.
From these rare abilities it could be seen to be as an extremely good piece of equipment. However there was a limit. The spider web could only be used up to 3 times in a week.
After that the necklace had to absorb Qi and transform it into the spiders webs. Without the webs as a primer the teleportation could not be completed so it could also only be used 3 times.
The reason it was so precious was because of these features and also because of how rare it was. In order to incorporate the special abilities of the Spider of a Thousand Tricks the beast spirit had to be fused with the necklace.
A beast spirit was a very rare occurrence when the soul of the primordial beast, as beasts who could cultivate were called, fused with their beast core. The beast core was a beasts version of the dantian but instead of the dantian being an organ that dissipated once killed it was actually a stone like object that kept all the beasts energy stored in itself.
Once a beast was killed there was chance the soul of the beast would incarnate inside the beast core. Of course, there was a chance it wouldn’t. The higher rank the beast the more powerful the soul of the beast and therefore an increased chance of a beast spirit.
It was said that beasts above the World Stage would have a one hundred percent chance of gaining a beast spirit. Those that were at Tiger Stage and below only had a 1% chance. Those at the Student to Scholar Stage had a 10% chance. Those at the Warrior to the Army Stage had a 20% chance and the beasts at the King Stage had a 30% chance. Finally those at the Emperor Stage had a 50% chance.
The increase of almost 50% showed the massive increase of both strength and spirit the World Stage unlocked.
Chu Bai took from the spatial ring a stone. This stone gave off large fluctuations of Qi. “Chu Shen, this is called the spirit stone. The main sect uses these stones for currency. I only have a small amount of 10,000 stones. I give these to you so you can use these when you enter the sect.”
Chu Bai put back the stone inside the spatial ring and took out a medallion with the characters of Chu Bai’s name carved into it.
“While I as an elder of a sect branch do not have a lot of influence in the main sect I do have some. An old friend of mine, Lan Wen, is an elder of the main sect that helps manage the school. “
“He will be able to help you a little if you come into trouble or need some things. Do not hesitate to ask something from him. Show him my medallion if he doubts that you are my son.”
“Yes father. I have a question though father.”
“What is it Shen’er?”
“Well father, I wanted to know why the elder of the sect does not have our families name.”
“That is simple. Our family runs the school and those of the main sect are favored so they typically become the powerhouses of the school. However, the main sect also takes in talents from the school directly into our clan. Those who join do not need to take on our family name.”
“I see father. Is there anything else I need to know then.”
“Yes. In order to enter the School there will be a trial. First there will be a simple screening, then a strength test, and finally some duels.”
“It is impossible to tell the strength of a person unless you see them in battle. In order to make it fair the sect also passes out a basic cultivation technique for all the surrounding villages, this way anyone who is talented will stand out.”
Chu Shen nodded. Naturally when someone entered the school they would of course need to test their talent. Of course, someone’s achievements could not always measure their potential.
Therefore in order to narrow that possibility down as much as possible the sect needed to have a basic cultivation technique readily available. This meant those who worked hard or those who were naturally gifted would stand out more than his peers.
“I understand. Truly the main sect has thought of many things. Is there anything else father?”
Chu Bai adopted a thoughtful expression as he put his hand on his chin. “Hmm, well. I gave you the medallion, the necklace, and the spirit stone. I already told you about he sect trials so there is nothing else. Now, in three days the flying spirit beast from the main sect will appear. You and Master Lin will be going together. Put the rest of your baggage in the spatial stone and prepare to leave. Remember son, you must become stronger to save your mother.”
Chu Shen nodded resolutely. A stubborn look came across his face. “I will father, don’t worry.”
The next three days was spent training. His master was busy crafting the things he asked for so the crafting of the weapons for the Lin Sect was left to him on the first day. The replacement artificer came on the second day and took over, allowing Chu Shen to have more time to cultivate.
His strength was actually up to almost 360 pounds since he broke into the ninth level of the man stage. Each time Chu Shen broke into a new stage of the <Void King> technique, it would accompany a massive increase of strength otherwise it would only steadily increase the strength of the person.
Finally it was time to go.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 19: An Expert?</h1>
 
Screee
Chu Shen grabbed his ears in pain. An eagle swooped down and landed on the ground. However, there was something wrong with this eagle. It was as big as a house and carried a carriage on its back!
Once his ears stopped ringing Chu Shen started marveling at the beast. “Come on Chu Shen, we don’t have all day.” Master Lang walked towards the beast
“Yes, coming Master Lang.” Chu Shen immediately ran up to the beast. He walked up the rope ladder and climbed into the carriage. Soon after he got into the carriage the beast took off with another cry.
Screee
“Dang. This bird has really got to stop doing that or I’ll go deaf.” Chu Shen rubbed his ears in dismay.
“Haha. You just might. The Mountain Eagle has been known to kill normal people with its war cry, lucky for you that’s just the warning and not its battle cry. Not to mention the fact that it’s still growing up.” Master Lang kindly informed Chu Shen.
“….”
As they flew through the air they rocked back and forth. The movement of the beast was almost hypnotic, quite soothing to the soul. Slowly Chu Shen became relaxed and imagined he was on a ship and not on a beast over a mile in the air.
“Chu Shen, you remember the weapons you asked me to forge correct?”
“Yes master, of course I do.”
“Well, I finished it.”
“That is great Master!”
“Here, I wanted to give it to you.” After saying so a hammer appeared in Master Lang’s hands. It had the same dimensions as the hammer Chu Shen originally had in the trials. It was 1 and a half meters long with a heavy head and a spike mounted to the end.
Inscribed on the head of the hammer was ancient arcane symbols that gave off a faint sense of power. Chu Shen recognized the symbols as the inscription patterns that he had asked for.
Inscribed on the hammer was two inscriptions. The one on the handle was a [Channeling Inscription]. It’s a very useful inscription no matter your cultivation level. The inscription essentially lets someone channel their Qi into the weapon easier, making the weapon harder and sharper.
It also let you use less Qi to make the same effects. Normally it would boost the Qi by 30-35% if made by both a Master Blacksmith and Inscription Master, but this was a weapon crafted by a Master Artificer. It actually boosted the Qi by 45-50%.
The other inscription was something that was best used for heavy weapons. It was actually an inscription created by Master Lang. Inscriptions are often copied and sold to other people however legacy inscriptions such as this one were only passed down from master to disciple.
This inscription called the [Earth Shattering Inscription]. The inscription changed the weight of the object, making the weapon as light as a feather while swinging it or making it more than 100 times its weight.
This let heavy weapons such as the hammer become as agile as a swordsman but hit as hard and with more weight. Imagine the weight of 1,000 pounds suddenly falling on you. It could certainly shatter the earth. What was even more scarier was the fact that there was no limit.
The more Qi you fed it the more weight the hammer gained. Master Lang had taught Chu Shen about inscriptions and helped him learn about them. Though he could not make inscriptions, he could easily identify and recommend inscriptions on weapons he forged. That was how Chu Shen knew what inscription to request of Master Lang.
Because he could not make inscriptions he was not qualified to be called an Artificer. However, since he could nullify his Qi’s affects he could finally pursue his passion and become an Artificer.
Master Lang looked on Chu Shen as he studied the hammer with pride in his eyes. Chu Shen looked up at Master Lang with appreciation all over his face.
“Thank you Master Lang, it is truly all I could ask for and more.”
“Haha! I knew you would like it. Now, you probably don’t know what material this is made of.”
Chu Shen shook his head. “Truly the metal is curious. It’s only as hard normal steel, I didn’t think this kind of metal would be suitable for a cultivators weapon.”
“You brat.” Master Lang smacked Chu Shen upside the head, though love could be seen in the violent gesture.
“This metal that is so feeble, as you put it, is called Living Steel. It’s a steel that can actually cultivate and grows as it does.” Chu Shen gazed at the hammer in respect.
“By mixing it with different minerals it can actually take the properties of them and when the metal absorbs Qi it transforms into a metal similar to it.” By now Chu Shen had a completely different outlook on the hammer.
“My master gave me a fist sized chunk of this Living Steel. I have nurtured it and used it in some of my finest creations. However, I have run out of money and materials. This is the last of my good resources but I do have a fragment of black iron.”
“I will show you how to do the assimilation.” Master Lang stood up and walked towards the hammer.
BOOM
SCREEE
A large explosion rocked the carriage. The bird yelled out screech of pain. Chu Shen looked around in befuddlement before he was suddenly grabbed by Master Lang. Immediately Master Lang ran outside the carriage with Chu Shen under his arms.
Outside the wind howled as it rushed past their ears. The eagle was still flying though some of its feathers had cracks in them but no blood flowed. The feathers of the Mountain Eagle might look soft but they were harder than steel and they had the defense like a mountain.
Flying beside them was ten small flying beasts of different varieties, all in the late Tiger stage with a cultivator of unknown strength on its back. Their Mountain Eagle was actually in the early Dragon stage.
A scaled bird opened its mouth and spat out a large yellow fireball. The fireball exploded on the Mountain Eagles feathers where they had been damaged causing even more cracks to spread.
BANG
SCREEE
Master Lang cursed quietly before putting down Chu Shen.
“Master, who are these people and what do they want?”
Master Lang sighed. “Their bandits. They are probably trying to shoot down the Mountain Eagle. No cultivator that can survive a fall like that unless they can fly. Apparently they will pick up our belongings after we fall.”
“Now I will show you my strength. I was planning on telling you about it later on so I could see your face but I guess I will settle for this.”
Saying this Master Lang withdrew a mace from his spacial ring. This was the reason he had researched and come up with the [Earth Shattering Inscription]. It was to magnify his combat ability.
Gripping his mace firmly Master Lang prepared to fight.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 20: Strong</h1>

Infusing Qi into his voice, Master Lang called out to the rider of the scaled bird.
“You are courting death! To dare attack the Chu Sects carriage you deserve to die a death of a thousand cuts!”
The driver of the Mountain Eagle stayed off to the side. He was only at the late Tiger stage. He was a beast tamer, a profession where the person bound a beast to ones soul and raised it.
He could be of no help in this fight except for keeping the Mountain Eagle calm. While the Mountain Eagle had a great physical prowess, its long-range attacks were lacking.
Immediately after saying this Master Lang swung his mace at the scaled bird. Qi surged off the tip and rushed towards them. The Qi resembled a mountain, aiming to crush the poor fools in its path. An image of a mountain faintly appeared in the air behind Master Lang.
As the Qi came towards the thief the sneering look on his face immediately disappeared. Instead a face of disbelief came over him. Grabbing a sword from his side he swung it at the mountain.
The sword gave off an imperialistic and noble feeling. It was incomparably sharp and seemed capable of cutting the world in half. The Sword Qi met the Mountain Qi. When they did, it was not with a large explosion but rather, when they met the sword Qi faded and disappeared.
The Mountain Qi smashed into the scaled bird and rider. With a puff of red the bird and man pair directly dissolved
Qi appeared around Master Lang covering him in a blinding light. When it dissipated he was covered in earthen colored armor. Master Lang jumped off the Mountain Eagle before hovering in midair.
All of the thieves faces changed. They had thought this would be easy prey but their strongest warrior had already been killed. When the old man had mentioned the Chu Sect they already carried hesitation in their heart. Now that they knew the strength of that old man they were definitely anxious to get away. Immediately the thieves started flying away rapidly.
“Ha! To late to regret it now.”
Saying so Master Lang disappeared. Suddenly one of the beasts exploded. Some of the thieves tossed out treasures. Dazzling Qi exploded in the air. Nothing saved them though. Each time the treasures and Qi collapsed soundlessly once Master Lang assaulted it.
One by one all the flying beasts exploded into blood mists, sharing the fate of their comrades.
Chu Shen stared in amazement. To be so fast as to become invisible to the eye, to be able to fly in the air with a mere thought, this was true power!
‘I wonder when I can have power like that.’ Chu Shen eagerly looked forward to that day.
“Impressed Chu Shen.” Master Lang whispered in his ear.
“Gaah!” Startled, Chu Shen let out an involuntary cry before turning around. Master Lang merely stared at him with a bemused expression on his face.
Showing his displeasure, Chu Shen let a “Humph” and turned his back. Laughing, Master Lang waved him into the carriage. The carriage had survived the attack. After all, the thieves did not want to damage any treasures in the carriage.
“These old bones just can’t move like they used to.” Master Lang sat down and sighed.
“Anyways, where was I? Oh yes. Let me help you with assimilating that black iron into the Living Steel.” Master Lang reached out his hand and in it appeared the hammer.
Apparently during the chaos earlier he had grabbed the hammer and stored it in his spatial ring. Along with the hammer Master Lang withdrew a chunk of black iron the size of a babies fist.
Holding up the iron he started to explain some of the mysteries of the Living Steel.
“When I made this hammer I put a restriction on it. Once you reach the Dragon stage you will naturally be able to lift it. The restriction is in place so that the Living Steel will keep its shape. Once you reach the Dragon stage you can change the shape of the weapon. “
“Now in order to merge any material with the Living Steel you must infuse the hammer with Qi. Then you simply put the metal you wish to merge it with on the steel. The greater the upgrade the more Qi needed.”
“For example, if I tried to directly merge Red Cloud Steel with the hammer you would have to be at the Martial Warrior stage to support the drain. Also, the Living Steel is cultivating to reach perfection. Because of that it will absorb the best qualities of any metal it touches.”
“If you gather Lava Stone and merge it with a hammer of Red Cloud Steel it will not absorb the hardness of the Lava Stone because the Red Cloud Steel is harder and lighter than Red Cloud Steel.”
“However because the Lava Stone is extremely fire-resistant it will cause the Red Cloud Steel hammer to take on the fire-proof properties.”
He handed back the black steel and hammer to Chu Shen. “It’s a very simple process. You try it.”
Chu Shen circulated the Qi in the manner his teacher taught him to cancel the null Qi’s special effects. His Qi flowed from his dantian, through his meridians, and into the hammer. The hammer started glowing a faint white.
Grabbing the black steel he touched it to the hammer. The hammers steel handle immediately rippled like water. The Living Steel covered the black steel. The black steel started dissolving into the Living Steel.
As the black steel started melting the Living Steel’s ripples started coming faster and faster. With each ripple the Living Steel started becoming darker and darker.
Eventually all of the black steel was gone but the Living Steel kept changing. The Living Steel final stopped changing but now the entire hammer looked like it was crafted out of black iron now.
Chu Shen grabbed the hammer. “A good hammer, truly a good hammer.”
Master Lang then pulled out another contraption. This was a sleeve crossbow. It was small with a lever to pull backwards instead of a crank like the one he had before.
It was small, almost unnoticeable if worn in the sleeve of his shirt. “The material used for the string and crossbow is also living steel. I already assimilated Aquamarine Steel into the string of the crossbow. As you know its flexible but very strong, just like you asked it to be like.”
Chu Shen’s jaw was already on the floor from the gifts he had gotten.
Master Lang looked on with pride. “Okay, now sit back and rest. We will arrive soon and you will need your strength for the trials.”
Following his masters advice he sat back in the carriage and fell asleep. By the time he woke up, Chu Shen would be that much closer to entering the academy.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 21: Young Master</h1>
 
Chu Shen looked down at the town in amazement. It was big, over ten times the size of his old village. He had never seen such a big place, after all, he had trained at home all his life.
The examination to enter into the Chu school was given inside the city. The reason was that those who traveled here could rest until the examination.
The Mountain Eagle flew down towards a field outside the city. Beside the empty field was a hut and a collection of fences with other beasts inside them.
There was more than three kinds of birds and two giant mammoths. The fences were obviously not strong enough to keep the animals inside but since a beast trainer managed them it was obviously not a problem. The fences were really there to keep people from going inside or wild animals from bothering them.
Getting off the Mountain Eagle Chu Shen and Master Lang bid the beast trainer farewell. The master and disciple pair headed off for the town. Upon arriving they discovered that the Schools trials would start in two days time.
Master Lang frowned. “With this I am afraid we will have to rent a room. While I do that, how about you go off and find out some more details on this examination.”
“Yes Master Lang.” Chu Shen readily agreed. He was also curious about this examination. Departing from his master, Chu Shen set out to explore the town.
Walking around he exclaimed in astonishment at the different things he found. One store sold eggs of spirit beasts, another sold beast cores that had been refined. Beast cores had a very violent energy inside them so some people would refine the energy and make it gentler, letting the cultivator absorb energy straight from the beast core. This made beast cores extremely suitable for cultivating.
There were other stores that sold mundane things such as fabric and utensils but Chu Shen wasn’t interested in shops like those. No, what really fascinated him was the weapons, elixirs, and inscription shops, though there was only a handful in the entire city.
Chu Shen went towards the nearest weapon shop when he heard some fighting. Coming around the corner he saw a young master dressed in fancy clothes and waving a fan around. A young fellow was on the ground, a bright red mark on his face. In his hands was a leather pouch and standing above him was a man in leather armor.
The young master had a face as red as a tomato. Chu Shen was able to catch the tail end of his tirade. “To dare steal from me, your father! I will string you up at the city gates and let all those who want to spit on you until you become a broken corpse. Guard! Take him to the prison!”
“As you wish young master.” Reaching out a hand towards the thief the guard went to grab him. The thief, with a panicked expression on his face suddenly sneered. With a speed that made it hard to see the thief got off the ground and took off running down the street.
Coincidentally the thief ran towards Chu Shen. Chu Shen had always stayed at home and was truly naïve and innocent. Seeing that the young master had been robbed he thought it was only natural to help the young master out.
Punching forward with his hand, Chu Shen knocked the thief backwards. Chu Shen also stumbled back three steps. Surprisingly enough, that little thief was actually a level 10 Man stage cultivator.
The guard who had reacted immediately grabbed ahold of the thief as he stumbled backwards. The young master ran up to thief and yelled in his face.
“To dare think of running away! Truly courting death!” With a wave of his hand the guard hauled up the thief and drew his sword. There was a flash of blade Qi and then the young thief fell to the ground.
While it was obvious that the thief was dead, it was not clear how. While Chu Shen puzzled over this the young master came up to Chu Shen and bowed.
“Hey hey, to have such a good cultivation at such a young age you must be quite talented. How about I treat you to a meal little brother?”
Without pausing the young master grabbed ahold of Chu Shen and led him towards a nearby restaurant. The young master bought some food and started talking to Chu Shen.
“Ah, so you came to participate in the Majestic Sword Academy’s admission exams. Well I am going as well.” The name of the School managed by the Chu Main Sect was called Majestic Sword Academy.
“That’s great! Maybe you could tell me about it. Also, I never caught your name.”
“I am Bei Fong, son of the city lord here. The Chu Exams is made up of three parts. The first is a test of your level of cultivation, the second is your physical strength, and the last is a series of duels.”
“It seems forward enough.”
“Yes, its very simple. However, I would advise caution. Recently there have been rumors that this years exam is special. Apparently some of the clans have been grooming some strong experts in the younger generations.”
“Now they are planning on unleashing them in this year exam. I heard the lowest cultivation they have is the tenth level of man. The competition will surely be fierce.”
“What exactly is your cultivation stage?”
“I am at the ninth level of the man stage.” Chu Shen had another breakthrough on the way to the town.
“That doesn’t seem high enough. If I were you I would wait a year or two. After that it will be back to the usual and you would definitely become a dragon among men.”
Chu Shen shook his head. “My father sent me here to take the exam, how could I possibly lose face for him and run away like a coward. No, I must take them this year.”
Bei Fong sighed and shook his head. “Fine. Here is my advice then. Show off your skills in the first trial but be extremely careful who you fight in the duels. Last year they didn’t separate the different stages but they might this time. If they don’t welllll…. Just remember they are stronger than you, it is no shame to give up.”
Chu Shen nodded. “Thank you Bei Fong. I feel that I might take your advice. Now however, I must take your leave. I have to get back to my cultivation.”
“Take care. I can’t wait to see how a young guy like you will do on the exam.”
Chu Shen went back to the hotel and told Master Lang of what he had heard. He nodded his head. “As expected, the trial is very simple. Go ahead and train until the trials begin.”
Chu Shen took his masters advice and trained. Right now he couldn’t train in any martial skill but his  <Absolute Control> skill. The reason was simple. Until he reached the Martial Realm he couldn’t release large amounts of Qi from his body so all of the skills he gained from theVoids Hand was wasted until he could breakthrough.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 22: You Forgot To Ask What?</h1>
 
When Chu Shen walked out of the restaurant there was unexpectedly a pair of eyes on him. Because of his low cultivation and lack of experience he could not tell that someone was watching him.
Sitting upon the rooftops opposite the restaurant sat a black robed man. With a coldness that could cause even a tiger to hesitate the eyes stared down on Chu Shen. The plot to steal that thing from the city lords brat had failed, due to this boy.
His most trusted promising youth had been killed all because of this brats interference. While he couldn’t get revenge on the city lords son, he could get revenge by killing this boy.
Smiling with this vicious thought in mind his outline shimmered and then disappeared into thin air.
“Master are you ready to go yet?” Chu Shen walked into the main part of the bedroom. He had been ready for almost an hour and had spent the rest of that time trying to ease the nervousness in his heart.
His master wasn’t there, and neither was any gear of his. On the bed was a note. ‘Chu Shen, I have gone browse around at a couple Artifact stores. Go to the trials and if you can come back to the hotel within the week so I can find out what happened. Do not lose your masters face.’
He smiled. Just like his master. To be an artificer requires patience but Master Lang had a unique type of patience. As far as crafting goes he could wait an entire week to craft a superb weapon, but when it comes to watching others do something Master Lang wouldn’t have any at all.
He always had something to do and would only stop by and look every now and then before judging the final product. Shaking his head Chu Shen grabbed his hammer, stored it in his ring, and walked out of the hotel.
As he started walking down the road he stopped. ‘Crap. I forgot to ask for directions.’
The black robed man stared at Chu Shen. He could see that he had just gotten out of the hotel. He couldn’t assassinate that brat in plain daylight, if so the city guard would be on him in seconds.
He likewise couldn’t attack Chu Shen in the hotel because of the old monster in it. If he decided to cause a ruckus in the hotel it would simply be him throwing his life away.
Revenge wasn’t worth that much.
Stalking the brat the black robed man started to become confused. He kept asking people questions only for them to shake their heads.
Why?
Why did he keep asking and what was he asking? While the black robed man puzzled over this weird conundrum, the little brat suddenly took off. Cursing, the black robed man hurried after him.
Chu Shen kept asking people where the trials were but no one knew. He kept looking around when suddenly he saw Bei Fong off in the distance. Chu Shen immediately thought of how Bei Fong said he was trying out as well. ‘Maybe I can get directions from him.’
Chu Shen immediately caught up to them. “Hey, Bei Fong. Its me, Chu Shen.”
Bei Fong looked puzzled for a second then smiled. “Ah, its you. I didn’t expect to meet you before the trials began.”
Chu Shen had a bashful smile on his face. “Well I was planning on meeting you there but I forgot to ask you something.”
“Oh, what exactly?”
“Where is the trials at exactly?”
Upon hearing Chu Shens question Bei Fong immediately started laughing. Even the cold faced bodyguard that stood silently behind smirked at that.
“Hahaha. Something that simple? Hahaha. How could you forget to ask something so basic? Hahahaha.”
Chu Shen just stood there, waiting for Bei Fong to stop laughing. “Ahh. Its been a while since I laughed that hard. Thanks brother, you certainly do have a certain naïve charm. Come on, you better follow me to the trials otherwise you would be robbed a dozen times before making it. Truly you are too young. Only what, ten years old?”
“ Twelve actually. Thanks brother Bei Fong.”
As they walked they eventually made it to the edge of town. There was large crowd there all lined up in front of a large tent with tables next to it.
“Come one Chu Shen, go ahead and get in line. I will wait with you.” They got in line and waited to register for the trails. Soon enough they had almost reached the end of the line.
By now Chu Shen could hear what was going on. “Age” “Seventeen” “Cultivation Level” “Man Level 10” “Pass. Go over to the Elder over there”
‘Hmm. It seems that I simply have to tell them a couple things and then it will be fine.’
Chu Shen reached the front of the line. There was an elderly man with a long flowing beard. He stared at it, mesmerized. “Age” Chu Shen startled himself out of his reverie.
“12” “Cultivation Level” “Man Level 9”. The old man looked up for a second at Chu Shen before grabbing his hand. A pulse of Qi intruded in his meridians. Luckily he had already neutralized the nullifying effects or his secret could have been found out.
“Pass. Go over to the Elder.” With a wave of his hand he pointed to a middle aged man about 40 years old. Around him was bunch of other people. Walking nervously over to the man he studied the other people surrounding him.
The others were standing around in groups or by themselves. The atmosphere was quite weird. Soon they would probably be martial brothers and sisters but right now they were all competitors.
While Chu Shen was studying suddenly he heard a small commotion from the crowds behind him.
“What!” “At such a young age” “He certainly has a bright future”
Chu Shen turned around and saw the people in line staring at Bei Fong. He turned and walked towards Chu Shen before joining him. Chu Shen waited a moment before curiosity got a hold of him. “What exactly is everyone making a fuss over?”
Bei Fong had taken out a fan and waved it around, the perfect image of a graceful master. “I just told the old man what my cultivation was at and they were shocked.”
“It can’t be that bad right? I mean how old are you.” Chu Shen had started to accept Bei Fong as a true brother and was finally starting to relax around him.
“Hehe. I’m only 16, quite a bit older than you. I’m at the tenth level of the Tiger Stage, I don’t see why their all shocked.”
“…..”
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 23: It’s The Weapon</h1>
 
Chu Shen didn’t want to stand around awkwardly so he decide to strike up a conversation. “So how did you get so strong exactly?” Chu Shen was curious, was it because of Bei Fong’s talent.
“Well, as the only child of the city lord of major city, I got pampered a lot. Resources combined with my talent carried me through a lot of the way. How about you?”
“Mostly just hard work. Because of how out of the way my village is I didn’t have access to any medicines. The only thing I had was a fairly good technique but a traveling senior gave me a different technique that’s extremely suitable with me. I have already advanced two levels in under a week with it.”
“Seems like you have good luck. Hopefully it sticks with you. Maybe being around you will be good karma.” Bei Fong joked around while looking at the line. The last person was there.
“Maybe I will have a Buddha’s luck. You should definitely stick around.”
CLAP
A loud sound like thunder suddenly sounded. The low murmurs from the crowd suddenly stopped. Looking they saw the middle aged man had clapped his hands, resulting in the loud sound.
“Alright listen up. Right here is some strength testing stone.” The man gestured towards a collection of stone pillars as tall as a person and as thick as a tree. “Each one of you will come up here and separate according to different stages and levels. You will each punch the stone twice, then you will use your strongest armed hit on the strength testing stone.”
With that said the man immediately started calling out different stages, separating them into three different ones. A vast majority were in the Man Stage, about sixty in total. There was another twenty to thirty in the Tiger Stage and five people in the Dragon Stage. After that he separated the Tiger Stage cultivators into levels 1-5 and levels 6-10. Then he separated the Man Stage cultivators by every two levels.
Looking around Chu Shen saw that most of the people of the man stage was in his line. The middle aged man saw the problem and scowled. Finally he separated them into the ninth and the tenth level.
With that the trials began. Chu Shen was the very last person. Most people were anxious and tried to get to the front of the line but Chu Shen wasn’t worried. Why would he be? Most of the people here were 16-20 years old.
When compared to a twelve year old it was obvious that the younger one would have a brighter future.
Each time someone punched the pillar it would light up. The more force used the brighter it lit up. The pillars in the Man Stage were similar to a flickering candle. The ones in the Tiger Stage were brighter, like a burning fire, the Dragon Stage however was comparable to a large bonfire.
Smack Clang
The sounds of flesh hitting rock rang out followed by the sound of steel hitting it as well. Many loud sounds rang out as people used their own techniques. Those at the Dragon Stage and below couldn’t use Qi externally so only the sound of steel could be heard.
After a long time Chu Shen reached the end of the line. Striding up to the strength testing rock he took a stance. Infusing his fist with as much Qi  as he could, he punched out and hit the pillar with all his strength. The pillar lit up, barely comparable with those at the Tiger Stage.
“This kids got some strength.” “Yeah I know, he’s at the ninth level of the Man Stage but can hit like those at the beginning of the Tiger Stage.”
When Chu Shen heard their praise he turned around and smiled at them. After all he is still a kid and liked being complimented. Preparing himself he let loose with another strike.
A force of 370 pounds struck the rock with a loud Smack. Once again the pillar light up with a light similar to the first level of the Tiger Stage. Holding out his hand a hammer appeared in his grasp.
“Hyaah!” Letting out a loud roar Chu Shen swung at the pillar with all his might. With the help of the inscription Chu Shen decreased the weight of the hammer until it was as light as a feather. Swinging it with almost inhuman speed he increased the weight by over ten times.
Bang
Unlike those metallic ringing of swords hitting rock this was a loud and disharmonious sound. The middle aged man looked over at the source of the sound. As an esteemed elder he wouldn’t be interested in those with no talent so it was only natural that he had been watching those Dragon and Tiger Stage practitioner’s.
Right as he glanced over he saw a bright light emit from the pillar. He was stunned. If he remembered right, wasn’t that the Man Stage cultivators? So why did they have someone in the mid Tiger Stage in their line?
Curious he walked over to the line.
With the power of 370 pounds of force combined with the weight of his hammer hit the stone pillar. The hammer became over 500 pounds right before it impacted the pillar. The vibrations from the impact itself hurt Chu Shen’s hand and the ricochet was hard to deal with. Immediately neutralizing the weight increase he barely managed to stop the hammer.
A tremendous force hit the pillar, making it shine brightly.
The middle aged man was stunned when he saw that it was a person in ninth level of the Man Stage. Walking over to the recovering Chu Shen he grabbed his hand. Shocked he dropped his hand. This boy truly was at the ninth level.
“Boy, how did you hit the pillar so hard, what is the martial art you used.”
Chu Shen was shocked that an esteemed elder like him would ask him anything. Upon hearing his question he unthinkingly replied back. “I didn’t use any technique, it was my own strength.”
“It can’t be. Is there something odd with your weapon then?” This was along the lines of the elders thinking. Unless he was gifted with an unbelievably strong body it wasn’t possible for him to unleash a strike like that. It never occurred to him that someone would lie, after all he was an elder of the school they were trying to join, lying to an elder was something they couldn’t risk.
“Well, I do have a formation set up on it that changes the weight of the object. It can make it light or heavy.”
“Hmm, truly wondrous. Who exactly made this inscription?”
“It was a parting gift from my teacher.”
“I see do well in the duels.” The elder immediately dismissed Chu Shen as unimportant. Borrowing outside strength from weapons and formations was looked down upon in the martial world. In the elders eyes it wasn’t possible for the boy to have that much strength so the vast majority of it must have come from the formation

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 24: Duels</h1>
 
The elder stood in front of them once again. With a loud voice he started announcing the rules.
“Alright, next we will start the duels. Stay in your lines, we will take you to the arena”
With that he lead everyone forward. Soon they approached a large arena. Surrounding the arena was a large crowd, above the crowd was an elevated box containing the judges of the contest.
“Each person will fight in the arena. We will call you according to your lines. First off you will each receive a token with a number on it. When they call your number and Stage of cultivation come up, in the box are the judges of the contest. You win once the other person gives up, passes out, or is knocked out of the ring.”
“This is an elimination tournament. Once you lose go over to the right of the judges box.” Looking over there was a large patch of empty ground beside the box, obviously for the opponents who lose.
“There will be prizes announced at the end for those who win first place in their division.”
Everyone’s eyes turned red when they heard that. A vast majority of the people here were poor people from the surrounding villages. One of the Dragon Stage looked over at them and snorted.
“To think they would get so worked up over a little thing like this. I wonder what would happen if I took out one of my own treasures?”
Another at the Dragon Stage snorted as well and replied, disdain obvious in his voice. “Well I would say the would all die from shock. Truly a country bumpkin never changes.”
Many of the lower stage cultivators faces became unsightly. Who were these b*stards to insult them like this. Were they looking down upon them?
However, seeing as what their cultivation stage was they could only grit their teeth and bear their grudges in their heart. After all, who could fight against someone in the Dragon Stage when at the Tiger, much less Man Stage.
Chu Shen stared at them. Why? Why would they taunt someone just because of their background? Chu Shen, in his heart, was still just a naïve boy. How could he understand how cruel the real world was?
When the thief had died earlier he had accepted it as a punishment. In this cruel world people dying was an often thing, even Chu Shen had accepted this fact. That is why Chu Shen didn’t blink when it had happened, he thought it was a justifiable death, after all they were originally going to haul him off to jail.
The only thing Chu Shen thought was wrong with this situation was that it was never called for. If the person they insulted was someone they had a deep hate for he could understand that because it made sense, but to randomly insult someone because they could? Chu Shen struggled to reconcile this event in his heart with his worldview.
Finally he shrugged. This had nothing to do with him, why let it affect him? Chu Shen started mentally preparing for the trials. Meanwhile the people around him started to curse the people who spoke up.
“Who do they think they are, looking down on us like that!” “I know I come from a small town but is it really that insulting.” “Why do they group me with this lot, I came from the same town he did.”
Though they grumbled a lot none spoke loudly and those closest to them glanced around furtively.
A person came around the lines giving out tokens to each person in line. Finally they started calling out names. They started out with the cultivators at the man stage. To be honest, the fights were kind of boring.
A cultivator at the Tiger Stage and below had great strength, but they couldn’t use Qi outside of their body. Really all they were doing was reinforcing their body with Qi to make it harder to cut or hurt them. Basically it was like hitting a walking wooden dummy.
There was no big flashy moves or Qi explosions. If you walked into a bar fight it would look something like this. Also, because all the fighters were amateurs there wasn’t even a hint of grace or elegance in the fights. To be honest, most of the hits were luck.
As for those at the Dragon Stage, their physical strength was massively increased beyond mortals. Because of that the fights with them involved became filled with a sense of danger and excitement.
After all, when two people get into a fight where even the slightest misstep can send you flying dozens of yards it undoubtedly will raise your spirits. Truly a great spectacle.
Chu Shen was eventually called. Stilling his mind, Chu Shen walked up towards the stage. It was a simple piece of flattened land, about 50 meters wide.
Stepping onto the arena he looked backwards and got a glimpse of his opponent. His opponent wielded a sword, it was about 1 meter long. With his 1 and a half meter long hammer it was obvious that he had the advantage in reach.
However, because of the weight of the hammer the crowd assumed that his swings would be slow. Taking up positions on opposite ends of the stage separated by about 20 meters.
Chu Shen grinned. “Fight until one of you surrenders or cannot continue, do not kill or cripple your opponent or you will automatically be expelled from Majestic Sword Academy’s trials.” The elder in charge of the trials looked at them, seeing that they were he nodded. “Alright, let the match begin!”
Chu Shen looked at the person in front of him and waited for him to make the first move. Sliding his hand up the shaft of the hammer he grabbed it halfway.
With this the hammer had a slightly shorter range but now he could use the shaft like a staff. “I am Chu Shen from the Chu branch Sect Misty Pass.”
His opponent grinned as well. Calling out to Chu Shen he replied back. “I am Tai Long from nowhere important.”
“Let us have a good match.”
Tai Long immediately replied, “Yes, let us.”
Immediately Tai Long charged towards Chu Shen. Dragging his sword on the ground Tai Long suddenly swung it upwards in a diagonal slash. Before the sword made it halfway Tia Long suddenly flew backwards.
Thud
Using his second hand to grab the butt of the hammers handle, Chu Shen had thrust the hammer forward like a spear. It was common knowledge that a hammer must be used in sweeping motions unlike a sword which could thrust.
When Chu Shen thrust his hammer forward it most certainly caught Tai Long off guard. Not giving him any time to recover, Chu Shen immediately grabbed lower down the shaft. Making it lighter he started to swing it around in a circle.
WhirWhir
With his strong body and vitality, Chu Shen didn’t get dizzy, spinning around in a circle like a vortex his hammer became almost unavoidable.
Tai Long backed of before suddenly striking out with his sword. Right before the sword came in contact with the hammer Chu Shen increased its weight.
CLANG
The sword immediately took off like a rocket, coincidentally right towards the box with the judges. Before the sword hit the box a hand suddenly shot out and grabbed it. The owner of the hand was a man who looked to be around twenty-five.
Right before he grabbed the sword he had on a relaxed and carefree expression, after grabbing the sword his face showed some surprise but the sword was stopped easily.
Tai Long had grabbed onto his hand, pain and shock visible on his face. A couple drops of blood fell to the ground from the webbing between his thumb and forefinger. The recoil was that strong. Sighing he suddenly turned towards Chu Shen.
“You are most definitely strong, much stronger than me. Before your strength I admit defeat.”
“Its all right, there’s no shame in a loss like this, I had a good match.” Chu Shen acknowledged that Tai Long was certainly a good warrior. He had been caught off-guard by Chu Shen’s unexpected thrust and strength.
If he had known before he most definitely wouldn’t go head to head with Chu Shen. The man in the box stared at the sword for a second before throwing it down. It turned into a streak of gray light before landing point first in the dirt before Tai Long.
“Start the next match.”
After that the man simply waited. Chu Shen and Tai Long stepped off stage. Tai Long went off to join those eliminated while Chu Shen went back in line.
Back in the judges box a woman leaned over to the man who had caught the sword. “What surprised you so much, I didn’t think the great Stone Face could still be surprised by a junior like that.”

The man looked back at the woman. “Don’t call me by my martial name, you know its Chu Tang. Besides” Chu Tang looked back at the kid with the hammer. “He isn’t an ordinary kid. With strength like that, he certainly did pick the right weapon.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 25: Duels (2)</h1>
 
The woman frowned. “Stop being so mysterious Stone Face and tell me.”
Chu Tang looked at the woman. “It’s probably nothing, besides. STOP CALLING ME THAT!”
The woman gave a self-satisfied smirk. “Humph, so touchy. All I did was call your name.”
“Arghh.” Turning around to watch the next duels Chu Tang pointedly ignored her. The woman made a pouty face at him before turning to watch the show as well, hints of playfulness still visible on her face.
Sighing Chu Shen put the hammer back inside the spatial ring. Tai Long was someone that should have gone far in the tournament. It was a shame he had met Chu Shen. While he didn’t exactly care for the prize, Chu Shen always believed that he should try his best.
Looking over at Tai Long in the elimination box he knew the real reason he won. Every night ever since he went to the soul library, his teacher had him spar with the pillar shadows. The shadow was at the exact same level as him, it was like he was fighting himself.
Eventually he had learned the hammer vortex maneuver from one of the shadows. Even Ti Wu praised him for learning a technique like that. Though of course afterwards he berated him from not learning more.
He looked over at Tai Long. Maybe they could be friends? Shaking his head he dispelled his idle thoughts. Looking around he saw that there was only nineteen people left in the competition besides him.
Most were blade users. There was two people with bows and another three with great swords. These swords were big and unwieldy, a lot like the hammer. However, if they ever connected with the opponent it would have a devastating impact.
Besides that, there was one more person who had on dual swords. He was just coming off the dueling stage as the last combatant. From his match it seemed he focused on continuous attacks and high speed.
Chu Shen smiled. While normally a person wielding a hammer or other heavy weapon would be worried about someone who focused in speed, he was not one of them.
After all, Chu Shen had the [Earth Shattering Inscription]. With it his hammer was not as unwieldy and slow as other such weapon types. With this factor it could be said that Chu Shen was actually the menace of agility type cultivators.
He was fast and hit harder than anyone had the right to. With his strength it was most definitely cheating. An agility cultivator usually lost if someone could time their blows just right, or was faster than themselves.
Chu Shen was both fast and strong, he could completely suppress someone like this dual swordsman. Soon he was called up to the stage again.
It was one of the bow wielders. Bowing to his opponent Chu Shen introduced himself. “I am Chu Shen from the Chu branch Sect Misty Pass”
His opponent didn’t say a word but rather made an arrow appear in his left hand. Taking note of the thin band of metal on his hand, Chu Shen knew he had a spatial ring. ‘Looks like I can’t wait till he runs out of arrows then.’
Withdrawing his hammer Chu Shen held it halfway up the shaft with one hand. “Begin the match!”
Immediately the archer nocked an arrow and shot it towards Chu Shen. He quickly rolled to the left, dodging the three arrows the archer had sent towards him.
The archer was most definitely skilled, being able to fire three arrows in a matter of seconds and all of them only just missing their target. Chu Shen rushed forward towards the archer.
Before he could even get close a total of five arrows cut off Chu Shens approach, sealing off all exits. Gritting his teeth he brought up the head of the hammer and blocked one of the arrows and retreated.
Chu Shen reached down, his hammer disappearing into his spatial ring. Grabbing a hold of the arrow his opponent had shot he stored it in his spatial ring as well. The archer fired again at Chu Shen. Dodging once more he ran around collecting more arrows.
Dashing around and dodging arrows, one by one he picked up the arrows from the ground. Up in the judges box Stone Face laughed a little at the comical sight. In the middle of a duel this kid was running around like a squirrel trying to grab nuts for winter.
‘Certainly an interesting fellow. I wonder what his strategy is?’ Meanwhile the archer was starting to get a little frustrated. Every shot he made missed no matter how many he shot.
Each time he sealed this little fellow’s escape routes he would bring out his hammer and knock one of his arrows down. Five arrows was already his limit and his arrows were not unlimited. Already he had shot out over fifty arrows and only had another twenty left.
Suddenly Chu Shen stopped. ‘Alright, I think I have enough now.’ Using the arrow he held in his hand he threw it at the archer. With a sinister hiss it split the air, heading straight for his head.
Chu Shen had a startled expression on his face. He had aimed for the archers leg but unexpectedly his aim was off. Oh well, he hadn’t really thrown daggers, much less the hard to control arrows.
The archer was immediately frightened and dove to the side. Looking up he saw Chu Shen looking at him with a thoughtful expression. Taking out another arrow he threw it again at the archer. This time it flew just a little to the left of the archer.
Taking out more Chu Shen kept throwing the arrows at the archer. Now the archer was ducking and dodging, trying to keep away from the arrows that got closer and closer to their target.
Chu Tang laughed. Truly this was a perfect example of lifting a stone only to drop it on your own feet. The more arrows this fellow threw the harder Stone Face laughed. This fellow was truly a devious one. He frowned. He didn’t like how ruthless he was though, why did he aim for the archers head in a friendly duel?
Chu Shen realized he was almost out of arrows. With his continuous barrage the archer couldn’t fire a single arrow off. Chu Shen suddenly dashed forward towards the archer.
Seizing this chance, the archer started to nock an arrow before dropping it as he dodged Chu Shen’s own arrow. Starting to panic he managed to nock an arrow and unleashed it at Chu Shen. Because of how close it was there was no way for Chu Shen to dodge.
With less than three meters between them the arrow shot towards Chu Shen’s arm. Hitting it with a Clang it actually bounced off his arm.
With his skin hardened due to the <Void King> technique, how could he be harmed by a mere ordinary arrow?
As the archer stared open mouthed in shock Chu Shen took this opportunity to quickly close the gap. Without bringing out his hammer he directly punched towards the archer’s chest.
Pah
With a strangled groan he flew backwards from the impact. The natural strength of Chu Shen was most definitely overbearing. A slight trickle of blood appeared on the corner of the archers lip.
Chu Shen ran after the archer, gathering arrows on the way. Pausing a couple inches from his prone body he waited. “Cough cough.” The archer started coughing before looking up at Chu Shen with a mixture of shock, fear, and anger.
A white robed youngster ran up to the stage to the archer. Reaching into his sleeve he grabbed a pill and placed it in the archers mouth. Grabbing his arm, the white robed person supported the archer and walked him towards the area with the eliminated people.
The archer was set down on a bench with some other injured people. Chu Shen recognized the pill, it was a basic healing pill. After all, would a large sect waste expensive pills on a group of hopeful students? Probably not, besides, the judges could certainly stop the match before it became too deadly.
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 26: Duels (3)</h1>
 
Finally the duels ended. There was now two great blade users, one bow user, the dual swordsman, and five regular swordsman besides Chu Shen. Now it was nearing the end.
During the dual swordsman’s fight Chu Shen paid special attention to him. He fought one of the great sword users. First the duel swordsman and great swordsman closed gaps, quickly coming in range.
The dual swordsman immediately started attacking the great swordsman. Each time the great sword was swung at him he dodged it, ducking and bobbing while swinging his dual swords. Small cuts started adding up on the great swordsman.
With the dual swordsman’s skill he attacked from both left and right with a sword in each hand, making it impossible to dodge completely. The great swordsman couldn’t keep up and never actually hit his opponent.
Chu Shen was now excited, he couldn’t wait to fight against this person. He was most definitely a good opponent to duel with. They were once again about to fight.
After waiting for a while the fourth fight ended, now it was Chu Shen's turn. Before he could go up on stage the dual swordsman got there first.
“Huh. Seems this match will be interesting.” Chu Shen muttered underneath his breath before climbing on stage as well.
Bowing he introduced himself. “I am Chu Shen of the Chu branch Sect Misty Pass, let us have a good duel.”
The dual swordsman bowed as well. “I am Jian Kuai ⌈1⌋ prepare yourself.”
Chu Shen nodded, it was an appropriate name. Jian Kuai took up a stance with his swords. Suddenly he took off at Chu Shen.
He was startled at the speed Jian Kuai took off with. It was actually faster than the speed Jian Kuai had displayed in his fight earlier.
Realizing letting Jian Kuai get in close would be suicide Chu Shen took out an arrow and threw it towards him.
The arrow bounced off Jian Kuai’s sword. More arrows flew out before being blocked out, however, it did accomplish Chu Shen’s goal. Jian Kuai couldn’t advance forward and block the arrows, there was too many of them.
Chu Shen suddenly stopped throwing arrows but withdrew his hammer from the spatial ring instead. As Jian Kuai ran towards Chu Shen, Chu Shen started to spin in place, becoming a whirlwind of hammer blows just like when he dealt with Tai Long.
Jian Kuai paused right outside of Chu Shens range. He swung both swords in opposite directions, there was no way Chu Shen could block both. As the swords cut down, Chu Shen hit Jian Kuai’s right sword. The impact caused him to become unbalanced, the sword missing the target.
As Chu Shen spun around, Jian Kuai swung his other sword around. It left a small cut on Chu Shen’s leg. Disregarding this, Chu Shen advanced on Jian Kuai. Rolling underneath Chu Shen’s blows he ran towards his sword and picked it up.
Chu Shen stopped rotating. If he had continued then no matter how he tried Chu Shen would have become disoriented. Taking a stance Chu Shen prepared.
Jian Kuai closed in on Chu Shen. He swung his blades while Chu Shen blocked them. Again and again he attacked Chu Shen, the swords were unrelentingly attacking Chu Shen from all directions. By now, he had over a dozen minor cuts over all his legs and arms.
Frustrated, Chu Shen jumped backwards before swinging his hammer in a wide arc, forcing Jian Kuai backwards. By now Chu Shen realized his mistake in letting Jian Kuai get in close to him.
Taking advantage of the long range his hammer had, Chu Shen swung his hammer horizontally. Jian Kuai was forced back again. Without pause Chu Shen forced him back, continuously swinging his hammer in wide arcs.
Jian Kuai kept being forced backwards by Chu Shens hammer. Suddenly he rolled forward underneath Chu Shens swing. Springing up he jumped towards Chu Shen.
Startled, Chu Shen stored his hammer in his spatial ring and fell backwards. Jian Kuai missed Chu Shen and jumped over him. As he did, Chu Shen once again withdrew his hammer, clumsily swinging his hammer backwards at Jian Kuai.
He missed the swing as Jian Kuai rolled sideways. Lashing out, Jian Kuai slashed Chu Shen’s arm, forcing him to drop his hammer. Jumping towards Chu Shen he held his sword inches from his throat.
Panting Chu Shen looked Jian Kuai in the eye. “Sigh, I admit defeat.”
Jian Kuai nodded and stored away his dual swords. He bowed towards Chu Shen. “Thank you for the match, you almost had me.”
Chu Shen bowed back. “Thank you as well. If we sparred again I am sure the outcome would be the same.”
Chu Shen walked off stage with Jian Kuai, separating to head over to the eliminated side. A medic came over and gave him a healing pill. When he ate it, a soothing sensation came over him, getting rid of all the aches and sores from the fights.
His bleeding stopped quickly but didn’t heal completely. “Hey, Chu Shen. Come sit over here.” When he turned around he saw Tia Long waving towards him.
“Oh hey Tai Long. Didn’t expect to see you so soon.” Chu Shen immediately smile and walked towards him.
“Its fine. I didn’t have any serious injuries. I saw who you lost too. He sure is a piece of work.” Tai Long had an amused expression on his face.
“Yeah, he’s pretty skilled. He blocked all my arrows and could dodge very good.”
Tai Long nodded. “I am sure he will advance far in this tournament. He has some very fast swords.”
“Well what do you expect from someone with a name like that.”
“Yeah, I guess you’re right. Lets watch the rest of the exam.”

⌈1⌋ The name Jian Kuai is actually Jiàn kuài (剑快) and means fast sword. 

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 27: Winners of the Duels</h1>
 
Chu Shen and Tai Long watched the duels. It was interesting to watch other peoples fighting techniques. The Man Stage duels ended with Jian Kuai winning the duels.
At the end he was injured with blood streaming down his body. However, one of the judges stretched out their hand and healed Jian Kuai with a stream of light.
It was a mystical and thought-provoking sight when Jian Kuai was covered in a ray of light. To see that golden light that induced a cozy and homey feeling whenever you saw it. It was obvious that the person in the judge box was already at the World Stage and had an affinity with light.
Once you reach the World Stage, you can manipulate the elements around you that you have an affinity for. With Chu Shen it was obviously space. He was lucky that he knew what affinity he had before reaching such a Stage.
Soon after the Tiger Stage duels began. It was far more fast paced than the Man Stage duels. Loud sounds like rocks smashing together sounded out. Eventually the winner became a man with amazing boxing skills. He was extremely fast, probably due to his cultivation technique. With his dodging skills he won fairly unscathed. He also had a pair of gloves that let him block a sword with it.
Bei Fong was also skilled. With his fan he used it like a throwing knife along with his fabulous sword skills. He lost however, to an archer who kept him at bay. Eventually with an explosive arrow charged with Qi, Bei Fong was knocked off the stage, making it to fourth place.
Finally it was time for the Dragon Stage duels to begin.
The battle was intense. Bei Fong had joined Tai Long and Chu Shen. All three of them exclaimed in awe as the fights began. Their weapons were a blur, craters appeared in the stage as they fought.
Chu Shen realized that if he himself was out there he would have been killed without knowing what had happened.
They were incomparably strong. This was a stage specifically meant for dueling. The ground was made with hardened rock and could easily withstand Chu Shens blows as he knew from his previous fights.
Now though the Dragon Stage cultivators were making cracks and craters in the stage from almost each blow. One of the cultivators was sent flying back. Before he could hit the stage he hit a blue barrier. As he hit the barrier he was stopped cold, just like he had hit a stone wall, and slid down. The impact had almost zero effect on him though.
The barrier was erected by the judges to prevent the crowd from being hurt. After the cultivator landed he bowed towards his opponent before leaving. After all, he had been knocked out of the ring and therefore lost.
Soon enough the duels ended. After that they handed out prizes. The Man Stage winner won a medallion saying he was the best of the Man Stage. Along with that they won bottle of medicine pills and a Low-Tier mortal weapon.
All the other rewards were the same for the other stages. The only difference was that the Dragon Stage also received a High-Tier mortal weapon.
Weapons are divided into different stages. Each stage is separated into Tiers and furthermore into grades as well. Mortal weapons are suitable for those at the Dragon Stage and below. A High tier weapon was best for a Dragon Stage cultivator while a Low-Tier weapon was best for Man Stage cultivators.
After that was Martial weapons. Chu Shen had never heard of any other weapons grade though Master Lang had hinted around at it while he was forging.
Pills were also separated like this but instead of Martial or Mortal Weapons it became Martial or Mortal Pills.
After the duels winners collected their prizes the elder once again stood in front of them. “Okay. Now that you have all passed the duels, please get ready. I will leave a spirit mark on each of you. You all have two days to settle your affairs before leaving for the school. Once the two days are up, meet at noon on the third day here at the dueling arena.”
“After you get here you will be transported to the schools living quarters. The teachers will explain the rules of the school for you once you arrive. Now, off you go.”
Turning towards Bei Fong and Tai Long he bowed. “Friends, it was nice to meet you. I hope we can meet again at the academy.”
Bei Fong waved his fan imperiously. “Of course. Once I acknowledge someone as my friend I never let them go.”
Tai Long bowed back. “I will spar with you again and win next time. Train hard so you don’t lose to badly.”
Chu Shen smiled back. “Of course I won’t lose. Goodbye brothers.”
Quickly Chu Shen departed back. Soon he reached the hotel. Looking around he saw Master Lang had not arrived yet.
Chu Shen called out to Master Ti Wu inside his head. 'Master. Why haven’t you said anything for a while.'
After a few seconds a pain similar to a migraine overcame Chu Shen. While he clutched his head in agony Master Ti Wu’s voice sounded in his head. 'You brat! Disturbing my nap to ask a trivial question.'
After a few seconds the headache stopped. After Chu Shen recovered he started talking to Ti Wu. He told him of the competition, along with the fight he lost and the friends he met. Ti Wu made him share a mental image of the fight he lost.
After he saw it he criticized Chu Shen. 'You brat. You should have used the sleeve crossbow, you would have won for sure. Those weren’t excellent rewards but they would have been helpful.'
'I am sorry master but I can’t. If I accidentally killed him I would have been eliminated. I am not 100% confident in my aiming.'
'Oh I see how it is. You can throw arrows at the poor fool but you can’t use a crossbow like its meant to be.'
'Sorry master.'
'Oh well. Probably for the best then.' They stopped talking, waiting in the awkward silence that followed. Eventually Chu Shen spoke up.
“Master, can I remove the weights now.”
“Eh? Oh right the weights. I guess since you just had an intensive workout with all those fights you can take a break. Go ahead.”
Sighing in relief Chu Shen bent down and hiked up his pants leg. There on his leg was a series of metal weights attached to Chu Shens leg. Master Ti Wu had him forge them during the second day of training.
He detached them and also the ones on his arms, neck, and chest. As he detached the one on his right arm he accidentally dropped it. After all he was right handed and not quite as dexterous as his left.
“Crap!” Chu Shen exclaimed before the weight hit the floor.
Crunch Thud
With a slightly muted sound and crunching of wood the weight buried itself almost 3 feet into the ground after destroying the floor. After all, dropping a 150 pound weight on the floor was going to destroy something.
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 28: Master Lang</h1>
 
Luckily no one came to investigate the noise, Chu Shen had no idea how he would explain it. Without Master Lang to look over him Chu Shen decided to go to bed.
“What the heck is this?!! Shen’er, you had better be able to explain this.”
Chu Shen groggily rubbed his eyes. His master had apparently come home and seen the hole in the ground. “Sorry master. I dropped one of my training weights on the floor on accident.”
“Sorry! That's all you have to say! Now I have to pay for it.” Master Lang had a face of extreme sadness. “I just got paid to.” He mumbled underneath his breath. “Anyways, how did the trials go.”
“I managed to pass the trails. I even got into the top ten in my stage.”
“That's good. Now that we have some time, I think I will have you learn a little in formations and inscriptions. Since you can’t set up either it wo'nt be of much use when you craft but it will help you identify things others would miss. It can be of much use in the martial world.”
Chu Shen nodded. Knowledge was the key in many situations, for example. If he discovered the cave of an expert and had to break through a formation to survive, it would be impossible if he didn’t have the proper strength. However, if he knew the formations weak point than Chu Shen could break it by attacking that point.
This was the difference between a dumb brat and a true expert. His master started teaching him about inscriptions and arrays for the rest of the day.
The next day it started the same way. Eventually Chu Shen begged off of his training to familiarize himself with the town. Master Lang thought it was a great idea to expand Chu Shen’s horizon and went along with him.
Unbeknownst to them a black cloaked man was following them on the rooftops.
As they walked Chu Shen became curious. “Master, I know you sought out an artificing store, did you find anything good there?”
Master Lang smiled. “Off course I did. The most important thing I did was pass the trials to become an artificer.”
Chu Shen looked at him in curiosity. “Aren’t you already an artificer.”
“It’s not that I am not an Artificer but rather a symbol to everyone else. The Imperial Artificers Guild judges artificers and gives them a rank. When you have a great success in artificing you will have a lot of influence.”
“That is the reason I became an official artificer, so that I have the influence to protect you”
“That’s great master. So what exactly is your ranking.”
“Here.” Master Lang took out a small badge. On the badge was seven stars. When he took it out he held it up high and looked directly towards the rooftop of a house nearby.
Chu Shen looked at the house but didn’t see anything. “What is it master? Do you see anything?”
Master Lang looked away from the house after a couple seconds. Laughing he shrugged. “I just saw a lowly rat on the roof. I thought there was no rats in the city but I guess I was wrong, haha.”
With that Chu Shen and Master Lang wandered down the street towards a restaurant.
On the rooftop was that black robed man. Curiously the arrogant expression on his face was gone. Instead his face was pale with sweat covering it, his entire body shaking.
After a while he calmed down. Taking a deep breath he sighed. “That man’s cultivation was scary, not to mention him being a seven star artificer. I thought there was only twelve of them left.”
“Luckily I discovered this before killing his disciple. I can imagine I would not even know I had died if I truly had tried to kill him.”
The would-be assassin disappeared into the night with a gloomy expression on his face.
Chu Shen along with his master went to the dueling arena the next day about ten minutes before noon. There in front of the dueling arena was a two elders and in front of them was a large group of youngsters.
Set up on the ground was a formation. From his studying, Chu Shen knew it was a thousand miles array. It allowed a person and several groups of people to travel a thousand miles in an instant.
Chu Shen chuckled, the intensive studying was already paying off. Turning he bowed to Master Lang. “Thank you Master for accompanying me, may we meet again someday.”
Master Lang merely slapped his back and nodded. Afterwards he walked towards the two elders.
The elders looked curiously at this person. They had never been approached by someone in the crowd before. Since he had the appearance of a close acquaintance with one of the students he had not been run off, otherwise they would not have even let him get close to the square.
Stopping in front of the elders he merely looked at them. After a few seconds on of the elders spoke up. “What is your business here? If you have none then scram!”
Master Lang stared at them before saying in an arrogant tone. “You will take me to the Majestic Sword Academy.”
“What! To be so arrogant as to order around an elder of the Majestic Sword Academy! What makes you think you have the right!” The elder spoke up in a cold, harsh voice.
Master Lang said not another word but merely pulled out a badge from his spatial ring. It was actually his artificing badge!
The elder let out a sharp hiss of breath. Unexpectedly this was actually a seven star artificer! In the elder’s eyes this man did indeed have the qualifications to be arrogant.
The other immediately spoke up, grateful that he had not been rude. “ What exactly is it that you wish to do in the Majestic Sword Academy.”
Master Lang glanced at him before replying in an uninterested tone. “I wish to establish a base there and look over my disciple.”
The elder grew curious. “Why would you choose someone like him” He gestured towards Chu Shen. “Who does not have such a high cultivation to be your disciple.”
“Talent for artificing does not strictly depend upon your cultivation level. Besides, I owe his father my life.” After saying this Master Lang departed with a wave of his hand.

Both elders looked at each other with a pained look. It was completely unexpected that someone would disrespect them like that, it caused some misgivings in their hearts but they did not dare voice it. An Artificer with such a high level did indeed have the qualifications to be arrogant.

If he discovered the cave of an expert and had to break through a formation to survive, it would be impossible if he didn’t have the proper strength. However, if he knew the formations weak point than Chu Shen could break it by attacking that point. Of course, since he could cancel out his Qi’s nullification power, he could now set up formations and inscriptions but Master Lang didn’t know that.
This was the difference between a dumb brat and a true expert. His master started teaching him about inscriptions and arrays for the rest of the day.
The next day it started the same way. Eventually Chu Shen begged off of his training to familiarize himself with the town. Master Lang thought it was a great idea to expand Chu Shen’s horizon and went along with him.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 29: The School</h1>
 
Chu Shen and Master Lang waited for a while until all the students had arrived. He recognized the very last student as one of the Dragon Stage students. Of course the student had an arrogant look on his face.
As Chu Shen recalled the words they had said about ‘country bumpkins’ his face flushed with anger. All he wanted to do right now was wipe that smirk off his face.
However. The difference in status and strength was too great. But Chu Shen knew that he could indeed surpass him, and soon.
The elder on the left of the formation cleared his throat. “Ahem.” Everyone looked towards him. “We will now start the formation. You will each enter into the formation. Once you arrive tell the teachers there your name and they will direct you to the appropriate room.”
“As for everything else, it will be explained upon your arrival.” The elder on the right spoke up. Each elder gathered in the palm of their hands a ball of white light. It was obviously Qi. They slammed the balls of Qi into the formation on the ground.
Mystical runes inlaid on the floor with lines connecting them together lit up. “Okay students. Stand in the circles right there, then we can activate the rest of the formation.”
Chu Shen bowed to Master Lang who backed off to the outside of the pavilion like everyone else that was not a student.
The students eventually gathered into the middle of the group of circles. After they did the elder on the left and right made a mysterious symbol with their hands. Qi rumbled outwards into the formation before it suddenly activated.
A black whirlpool appeared beneath the rightmost circle. The students in that circle fell into the whirlpool before disappearing. One by one this was repeated before it reached Chu Shen.
While this happened some of the students panicked, it was quite logical to once you saw something basically devour your fellow classmates. The other students who were knowledgeable in this transportation method quickly shut them up.
The whirlpool appeared at their feet. There was a slight tingling sensation where the whirlpool was. As it moved upwards the tingling sensation spread. Where the whirlpool moved pass it seemed as though it had devoured Chu Shen, the parts of his body the whirlpool had already traversed had disappeared.
Once the whirlpool had reached above Chu Shen’s head it seemed as though him, and all the other students in his circle, had disappeared. Master Lang watched emotionlessly as Chu Shen was teleported out.
Eventually all of the students were gone. The elders both made another hand sign before touching the formation. One of the elders looked at Master Lang before gesturing towards the formation.
Master Lang stepped into the circle after he verified they weren’t teleporting him too far away from the students. One of the elders joined him before they teleported away.
After they were gone the elder that was left disassembled the formation before flying towards the Majestic Sword Academy.
Chu Shen looked around at his new settings. The whirlpool had deposited him inside a small courtyard along with the other students that were with him in the circle but no one else.
There was a middle aged man with a stern expression and dressed in the schools uniform standing in front of them. Based off the badge on his shoulder he was a teacher. “Alright students, gather over here. Okay, now one at a time tell me your name.”
One by one each person told the man their name and was then assigned a room number. Chu Shen was in Block 6 room 121.
“Now that your living areas are assigned go to them. In the halls there are some maps of the schools posted, follow them. In your rooms is a list of classes that you can each attend to.”
“We at the Majestic Sword Academy believe in cultivation free time. Each of the classes are voluntary and you may attend them on your own time. If you prefer to spend your entire time here cultivating then you may do so but you will be sadly uninformed of the outside world.”
“Also, there are things called spirit marks and spirit cards. Spirit stones are the currency at the academy here. Spirit cards are used to record your spirit stones and make transactions.”
“While we do provide some free martial techniques you must earn any others that you wish for, so work hard. That is all.”
Chu Shen was a very decisive person after working in the forge. When crafting you couldn’t hesitate and think about things but rather had to react and depend upon your ingrained thoughts.
He immediately set out for his room. After wandering through the halls and different pagoda’s he eventually managed to get to his room. It was actually a small house with a formation set in it to gather Qi letting him have twice the efforts with half as much work.
Chu Shen looked at a list of different classes, each with a day and time on it. There was a class every hour from 10-10 every day with a break for lunch. It was impossible to go to every class. There was classes on inscriptions, weapons, techniques, fighting styles, sparring classes, economy, army tactics, strategy classes, herbs, alchemy, and many other types of classes as well. It was almost limitless.
Sighing Chu Shen started planning his schedule for school.
.................................................................................................................................
Master Lang and the elder came out of the formation inside a spacious and very well decorated courtyard. The elder bowed to him. While Master Lang had a very special status it was most definitely not appropriate for an elder of the Chu Sect to bow to an outsider in front of a crowd.
This way both Master Lang and the elder was satisfied and saved face. “Master Artificer, while the Majestic Sword Academy has no issue with you staying here, the principal wants to meet with you.”
Master Lang, with his now familiar face of indifference, waved his hand. “Alright, I will meet with the principal. Take me to see them now.”
While the elder gritted his teeth inwardly at the way Master Lang spoke to him without the slightest hint of courtesy, his outward appearance was that of a servant. “This way please, Master Artificer.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 30: The Principal</h1>
 
Master Lang was lead along a winding path filled with plants and medicinal herbs. The Qi here was dense, letting the local fauna flourish. Soon they reached a stately building with majestic gold trim on the outside.
A sword statue stood in front of the building. Just by looking at it you could tell it had great mysteries regarding the dao of the sword hidden inside it.
Master Lang was actually startled when he saw the statue. The elder saw his expression from the corner of his eye and smirked. This was a statue personally carved by the founder of the Majestic Sword Academy whose sword arts was legendary throughout the world back then.
With such a powerful cultivator had personally carved such a thing, how could it be simple? In truth to those who studied the dao of the sword it was indeed a great boon to look upon.
Master Lang quickly recovered his senses and acted like nothing had happened. He followed the elder inside the building, there he was lead to an office.
Inside was a woman who looked like your average grandma except for the powerful ripples of power emanating from her frail body. “Master Artificer welcome. Please sit down.”
The principal was being very polite to Master Lang, and with good reason. A seven star artificer was as rare as phoenix feathers nowadays. They were able to craft some of the most powerful weapons and had great influence.
If a clan or sect was able to secure a seven star artificer for themselves it was guaranteed that their later generations would be adequately equipped. Not to mention that most powerful artificers also dabbled in alchemy.
After all, an alchemist have perfect control over flames, and knowledge on herbs. Because of this many great alchemists and artificers had some success on both paths. Both had to have control over flame and learning herbs or materials is all that separated the two jobs.
Master Lang politely acknowledged the principal, giving her some face.
“So, I heard from Elders Li Xen and Li Xian that you were planning on staying at the academy.”
“That is correct Madame Principal.”
“Please, call me Principal Mayweather.”
“You may call me Artificer Lang.”
“I wanted ask what your disciples name is.”
“His name is Chu Shen. He is still a Man Stage cultivator.”
“Is he from the main family?” The principal suspected this was the reason they were accepted as a disciple.
“No. He is from a branch family called Misty Pass.”
“Oh. Anyways, the reason I wanted to talk to you was to inform you that he will not be getting special treatment.”
“I never expected him to receive any. However, if I can provide resources better than the academies could he be allowed to accept any.”
“Of course, we allow anyone to receive outside resources so long as they are vetted by the academy.”
“Excellent.”
“Now that we have that down, I wanted to talk to you about a proposition.”
“Go on, I am listening.”
“The Majestic Sword Academy teaches a Beginners Forger and Artificer classes but we don’t have any Expert classes on the subjects. We are quite interested in hiring you to teach these classes, of course you can sell any weapons you forge and you can set your own schedule. You would also become a teacher of the school.”
Master Lang simply nodded. To be honest this was the whole point in him coming. By becoming a teacher here, especially in a class Chu Shen would be in would be extremely good for him.
This way he could protect his disciple through official channels thereby bypassing any resentment and discrimination from outside pressure. Also, there would be less resistance from other people. After all, if it was an outsider asking for favors it was an automatic response to reject it, no one liked being bossed around after all.
Principal Mayweather sighed in relief. Now the overseer from the Chu Sect would get off her back. “Thank you Master Lang. It is a great help for all of us.”
He smiled. “Don’t worry, you helped me as well”
....................................................................................................................................................................
Chu Shen sighed. Finally he was done with his schedule. Of course every few seconds Ti Wu would chime in with a sarcastic comment, however these comments did indeed help Chu Shen plan out everything.
First he would have weapons class, then formation and inscription classes, artificing, and finally techniques class.
With his schedule he would have two days of classes and the rest would be for research and cultivating. Chu Shen nodded, this was the best type of schedule.
Taking a deep breath Chu Shen sat down and started cultivating. He still had half a day left, of course he wouldn’t waste any of it.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 31: Mockery</h1>
 
A bald asian man stood in front of a classroom raving. Chu Shen had decided to take an extra class called Cultivation Breakdowns that went over different stages of cultivation. Right now it was his fifth time coming to the class and it often helped him realize how far he had to go to become a real powerhouse.
“You are vulnerable! Right now you are all still in the Mortal Realms. Until you enter into the Martial Realms you cannot adequately protect yourself. The reason for this is simple.”
“You have not unlocked your outer meridians. Once you do you will be able to emit Qi from your body like armor and survive in places you couldn’t right now. You can survive in lava, underwater, and even harsh impacts.”
“Right now the only things that separates you from a mortal is your body strength and durability. You can’t even use proper martial techniques yet. Yes, I do realize you are all practicing some form of martial art but those do not qualify.”
“Martial arts such as <Heavenly Shot> or <Absolute Control> are martial arts based off of proper utilization of your muscles or agility. Even mortals can become skilled in such techniques if they practice hard enough.”
“What really makes a martial artist stand out from mortals is Qi. Everything boils down to Qi. What enables a martial artist to destroy mountains or fly? Qi. What is used to tame beasts or create pills? Qi. What is used to forge weapons and control them? Qi.”
“Everything that a martial artist does is centered around Qi. So if a martial artist can control their Qi better or has an attributed Qi they can become powerhouses unstoppable in their stage.”
“As I am sure you all know you can release Qi right now. However, this Qi is at most a slight trickle and can only be used to power certain treasures right now like a spatial ring or even a small formation.”
“On the trial stage you all must have seen the archer with the explosive arrows imbued with Qi. This was not actually done by him but was rather the effect of a small scale array. When he reaches the Martial Realms he can use his Qi to imbue arrows and make a similar effect however right now that archer has to rely on outside help to do so instead.”
DingDongDing
The sound of chimes echoed throughout the building, seemingly coming from everywhere and nowhere. The bald asian man turned to look at the class.
“That concludes today’s lecture. Come back next week if you want, we will be going over the differences between stages and rough power levels of each stage as well. Dismissed.”
Chu Shen gathered his notes and left along with Bei Fong and Jian Kuai. In the hallways he saw many familiar faces, many of which had signs of adoration when they looked at him.
However, the faces Chu Shen enjoyed seeing the most was those students who were at the Dragon Stage in the trials. Upon seeing Chu Shen their faces would turn red with shame.
Things had changed drastically for Chu Shen at the Academy. Because his cultivation technique was extremely suitable for his constitution his cultivation speed was unparalleled.
Barely a month later and he was already in the 2nd level of the Dragon Stage. Comparing those Dragon Stage students to Chu Shen it was like the difference between heaven and earth. They simply lost all face, it was already considered amazing if they broke through a single level in a month much less breaking through an entire stage.
Because of the mocking words they had said at the trials their face was all but tossed in the dirt by the ‘country bumpkin’ they had looked down upon. Many of the students they had jeered at now mocked them openly.
“You broke through a level this week? Too bad Chu Shen broke through three.”
“So proud and arrogant yet barely any results. You’re just like a frog in a well, unable to see how wide the sky truly is.”
“They can’t compare to Chu Shen at all, it’s like comparing dirt to jade.”
Of the five students at the Dragon Stage two actually dropped out of the Academy. After all, they were proud sons and daughters of heaven from rich and noble families. When had they ever been openly mocked like this?
They couldn’t take the loss of face and pride and so to prevent a blockage in their cultivation those that could dropped out to re-enter next year. Those that didn’t were at the very age limit that the Majestic Sword Academy would accept and couldn’t re-enroll.
Chu Shen knew of this problem and had tried to talk to his fellow classmates and ask them to stop mocking them but only a handful listened. After all, Chu Shen was a kind and caring soul and really didn’t want anyone innocent to be hurt.
Even though they had indeed said some unkind words it was as his father said. “You may steal from an enemy, kill your enemy, but never destroy a man’s pride.” It was because of these words that he sought out the students at the Dragon Stage and apologized to him.
Those that had to endure the mocking of their classmates had their hearts full of anger towards Chu Shen. In their eyes they had done no wrong and instead blamed Chu Shen completely for the suffering they endured.
When Chu Shen came and apologized to them they thought of it as another form of humiliation but accepted it with a kind face. After all, Chu Shen was now a legendary talent and couldn’t be offended too deeply but they still carried deep grudges in their heart.
 
While Chu Shen thought of the problem as being settled both Master Ti Wu and Master Lang knew it wasn’t. If they could, they would indeed make trouble for Chu Shen later on.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 32: Great Opportunity</h1>
 
Chu Shen was bare chested inside the forgery. His eyes were closed as he concentrated. Opening his eyes he started a fire underneath the forge. The fire was a deep purple with hints of blue on the outside of the flame.
This flame was a special flame that could only be started using the ‘Hundred Year Old Iron Wood Tree’. It was the best type of flame to be used to refine low grade treasures.
The metal on the forge gradually melted until it was a liquid. Carefully Chu Shen poured out the metal into a cast of a sword. The metal cooled and slowly the sword was visible. He took out the sword blade and placed it back on the forge and heated it up,
Taking out his forging hammer he struck downwards with the hammer, pounding out the swords impurities and hardening it. After it was pounded out flat enough he folded the sword over itself. He repeated the process ten times, making the blade over 100 times stronger than before.
After the metal was folded over he once again shaped it into the blade of a sword and placed it inside another cast. This cast also had a sword handle sticking out of it.Then he began working on another piece of metal. The metal was even harder than that of the blade.
He repeated the same process as he had done with the other blade. Then he placed the melted metal in the same cast as the other, covering the sword with the second, harder metal and placed the top of the cast over it. Then he poured all of the metal out into it and sealed the cast.
Chu Shen waited for 30 minutes while carefully listening and watching the cast. Eventually he undid the cast and peered inside. The outer covering and the inner part of the sword had successfully bonded together and had also bonded with the sword handle.
Chu Shen had finally forged a Low-Tier Martial Weapon, or at least it would be if he could set the inscription on it right. Gathering up some materials he set them up inside a beaker and boiled them. Eventually the materials melted down to become a gold metallic ink.
Using the ink Chu Shen drew several mystical runes on the sword. Biting his tongue he concentrated fiercely on the runes. If anything went severely wrong they could explode and damage Chu Shen’s soul.
After a while Chu Shen put down the ink. As soon as he put it down the ink flashed a bright gold color making it look like the sun. Then the runes faded into the black steel of the sword, becoming invisible to the eye.
Studying the sword and the ripples of power emanating from it Chu Shen nodded. It was indeed a Low-Tier Martial Weapon. As he was inspecting the sword a door opened in the forge before someone walked in.
It was Master Lang. Upon seeing him Chu Shen bowed slightly. “Master Lang, I have finished the sword.” Chu Shen was indeed surprised once he found out that Master Lang was a teacher at the academy. The way he found out was indeed a little weird.
Upon entering the Artificing Class they had everyone craft their best weapon. When they saw Chu Shen create a High-Tier Mortal Weapon they immediately sent him to an advanced class for geniuses. He was the only student in the class and when his teacher walked in he saw it was indeed Master Lang.
However, when Master Lang found out that he could now inscribe inscriptions he was overjoyed. He started teaching him in earnest and provided the best materials.
Master Lang looked at the sword and nodded. “The sword and inscription match each other very well. The hard outside will make it exceedingly sharp and strong. The soft inside will absorb shocks and allow it to bend instead of break. Altogether it is a very fine sword.”
“However, there are still some flaws in your purification methods and your control over the ‘Iron Flame’ is lacking. Study those in your own time. Now, besides your forging I can tell you have reached the 10th level of the Dragon Stage, correct?”
“Yes Master I have. I reached it yesterday so I still have to stabilize my cultivation level.”
“Excellent. You’ve only been at the Majestic Sword Academy for a month and a half and already at the peak of the Dragon stage. In that case you will indeed go. There is a special opportunity that I have prepared for you to go. Have you ever heard of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion?”
“No Master I have not. Is it a store?”
“No it’s not a store but rather a trial area. Every five years a mysterious pavilion appears on a certain mountain peak for a day. No one knows where it comes from but everyone knows of it. Anyone may go in and can choose items from Heavenly Treasure Pavilion but be warned, it is not as simple as choosing random items.”
“Upon selecting a treasure there will be a trial you must pass before you take it. If you fail the trial you will be immediately rejected from the pavilion and instead lose your chance to gain more items, if you choose a trial you cannot handle you may even lose your life. The more powerful the item the harder the trial so be careful in what you choose.”
“It sounds interesting Master but what has that got to do with me?”
“Well Chu Shen, the Majestic Sword Academy along with the Chu Sect laid claim to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. Every five years the allow the top 5 most talented students of the academy from every grade to enter. Since there are five grades that is a total of 25 students that will enter the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.”
“As you know you are the most talented of the Freshmen this year so you will be going. It will be open in another week and they will be announcing it privately to the students that have been selected so get ready.”
“Yes master. Thank you for the warning.”
“It was actually my job.”
“Thank you anyways. Excuse me master but I must deliver this sword to Jian Kuai, I promised him one if I could forge it.”
“Alright, go on. Just be diligent okay?”
“Yes master, I will.”
Chu Shen found Jian Kuai and gave him the sword. As a dedicated swordsman a proper sword was precious to him. He thanked Chu Shen profusely for it. Ever since the fight at the trials he had been friends with Chu Shen and for a short time rivals before Chu Shen became too strong to spar with.
After they had become close Chu Shen had gifted Jian Kuai with the items he had forged along with Bei Fong and Tai Long. The reason he gave Jian Kuai this sword was not because he valued him above his other friends but rather that he had promised the next sword to him.
Eventually Chu Shen went back to his room after talking with his friends. Suddenly a long dormant voice spoke up in his head.
“Okay brat I have some interesting news for you….”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 33: Ti Wu’s Past</h1>
 
“What is it Master Ti Wu, it has been a while since I talked to you.”
“Well brat that’s because I was meditating to gather void Qi. Your body makes the perfect conduit what with you naturally gathering it from the universe.”
“What?! You mean you are actually stealing my Qi from me? You truly are a ghost!” Searing pain assaulted Chu Shen’s head. As he grimaced in agony he wondered why master Ti Wu always attacked him when they met up.
“You brat! Call me a ghost one more time and you will suffer!”
“Sorry master. What was this interesting thing you were going to tell me.”
“Actually it’s only something that helped satisfy my curiosity and coincidentally you can now live a lot less cautiously. Using the void Qi from your body I was able to scan this world. Naturally I could have scanned it some time ago but I needed void Qi so as to avoid being discovered.”
“When I woke up I thought this place was a little strange compared to my memories. You see, where I come from the natural laws are stronger.”
“Natural laws?”
“Yes, it is only natural that you wouldn’t know of this since you have never been to another plane of existence before. Basically different realms have different natural laws. These laws control how much suppression is put on the beings there and also how much Qi is there as well.”
“Basically a move that could shatter a mountain in a place with weaker natural laws might not even be able to crack a pebble in a place with with much higher natural laws. For example. Here the natural laws are more than three times weaker than in the realm I originated from. This means to accomplish the same feat here than in my realm it would take one third the energy.”
“If it takes more energy to do things then why would you go there?”
“Because the natural laws are stronger there you can sense them more clearly making it beneficial to understanding the laws necessary to breakthrough to certain stages. Along with the natural laws being stronger the natural Qi is also stronger.”
“The ground becomes harder because it contains more energy. Consequently, with there being more energy you can cultivate faster and the universe gives birth to more treasures as well. Essentially cultivation becomes easier and faster along with there being more opportunities.”
“So essentially your realm was richer in Qi than mine.”
“Precisely. I got off topic though. I will allow you to use all of the Void Sects secret techniques openly instead of hiding it.”
“I never truly got that master. Why would I have to hide it anyways.”
“Sigh. This is where things might get complicated. Sufficient to say I have my reasons. As you know from the techniques you have learned my sect was incredibly strong.”
“That much is obvious master.”
“Well I have some news for you. My sect was not actually the main sect but rather a branch sect. The founder was the son of an elder in the main Void Sect that wished to become the so called tiger of the mountain. Unfortunately while he had great talent he was not a heaven defying talent like some others. Comparing his Void Constitution to other talents his was lacking though he used top tier techniques from his father.”
“Because of his desire his father granted him the ability to establish a branch sect instead and become the founder and patriarch. His father even let him keep some advanced techniques from the main sect though his son could only pass them down to other people with Void Constitutions.”
“Why would he only let his son pass it down to others with Void Constitutions?”
“Mainly because most of the techniques required a Void Constitution. Most of the members of the main sect had a Void Constitution. As you know there is a strong possibility of passing down certain constitutions to their descendants. The Void Constitution is one of them. Because of this most of the sects truly powerful techniques required a Void Constitution.”
“There even became a technique that could create a pseudo Void Constitution and those with this pseudo Void Constitution gained a Void Body. As you know a normal body cannot withstand the power of Void Qi. So instead a body cultivation technique was used and those that reached the end of the technique had their whole body down to their cells infused with Void Qi and therefore gained the ability to have a pseudo Void Constitution.”
“Unfortunately the father outlived the son because of the stage he had reached the father could be considered as unaging. Afterwards he picked a suitable candidate for the patriach position and continued his sons heritage.”
“Master, while your story is awe inspiring I don’t see how this is related to the problem.”
“Cough cough. Anyways, because of this elders support from the background our branch sect could survive. Unfortunately during the time that I was the elder we received word that the main sect had been attacked by the Five Heavenly Mountains Sect that had combined their might with several other major sects.”
“Most sects were afraid of us because of the Qi we used including the Five Heavenly Mountains Sect. They used Heavens Qi, a Qi that was unstoppable when compared to all other types except for our own Void Qi. Out of fear they wiped the main sect out and began to extinguish the branch sects so as to not let the tiger return to the mountain.”
“The elder that was always supporting us was able to help us divert the disaster. At the time of the disaster he was actually visiting our branch sect to remember his son because it was his son’s birthday. He transmitted a full copy of all the sacred arts including the secrets of the Void Body to the voids hand before asking for volunteers to assimilate a soul into the gauntlet.”
“The only one that was willing was a cranky, cantankerous elder in charge of physical training. After that he sent the voids hand somewhere while he stayed behind to fight to protect his son’s dream.”
“I doubt he survived that fight.”
Chu Shen could not see his master’s face but could feel intense sorrow and melancholy coming from him. He had no idea what to do but to continue on. While it was interesting to find out his teachers true background it was not what his teacher had been trying to teach him.
“Master. I know this is tough but what does all that have to do with me being able to use the Void Sects arts in combat.”
Inside the voids hand Master Ti Wu was staring off into space while tears trickled down his cheeks. Yes he was old and yes he did enjoy watching others suffer pain more than he should. It could actually be considered a psychological addiction that had resulted from his training his students in such a painful method like body cultivation.
However, he had lost all his friends and family in that fight. His emotions had been bottled up and truly he needed to express himself somehow, otherwise, how could he be willing to share his story with a disciple?
Upon hearing Chu Shen’s voice Ti Wu was startled out of his recollection. Killing intent came out of his eyes for a second before he stopped himself. After all, what could he expect from a little kid with no ideas of adult emotion?
Lightly brushing away the tears Ti Wu answered his naive disciples question. After all, what more could he do?
“Ahem. Anyways I thought you could come to this conclusion on your own but instead I have to tell you everything you little brat. Basically if Five Heavenly Mountians Sect was willing to destroy even the branch sects, what do you think they would do to someone who is using the Void Sects techniques?”
“Kill them of course! This is why you had to mask your techniques and also your Qi. However since we are on a different plane they are not here. Because of that no one would recognize the type of Qi you have so you can use it to its full potential. That is why I am letting you use these techniques.”
“Now that I have explained all that to you I have a special surprise for you. I can now use the void Qi I stored up to strengthen your body but it will hurt a lot. Will you do it?"

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 34: Just Training Is Not Enough</h1>
 
Without hesitation Chu Shen immediately nodded his head. After all his mother was still held captive wasn’t she? He still had to reach the Emperor Stage but if his power was weak what good could he be.
Right now while Chu Shen had a stronger body than his classmates it wasn’t by a whole lot. His body was tougher and he could lift about another 800 pounds compared to them. Though when you could lift about 4000 pounds (Or 2 tons) another 800 was significant but not game changing.
To put it in simple turns. Everyone else could lift 100% while Chu Shen could lift 120%. While that 20% more strength and body toughness was helpful it was not a guaranteed win.
“Alright brat, since you agreed just give me a half day to prepare. While you are waiting go through your normal exercise and then go to the caves of isolation for the training.”
“Yes master.”
Chu Shen went to his least favorite spot on the school grounds. There was a large waterfall at the edge of the school. Unfortunately Master Ti Wu had him train underneath the outermost edge of the waterfall.
Bracing himself Chu Shen got on the slippery rocks and went under the very edge of the waterfall. Compared to the other parts of the waterfall the power here was lacking. But that was like the comparison between a tiger and a dragon. While a dragon would win a tiger could not be taken lightly because of this.
The waterfall fell down on Chu Shen, as the water hit him it felt like needles driving into his Qi enforced skin. The water tried to pull him downwards, the pressure on his shoulders made any movement almost unbearable.
Chu Shen started practicing <Fundamental Fist Skills>, <Fundamental Kick Skills>, and <Absolute Control>. His teacher had recommended to practice the first two since the moves went through the various muscles of the arms, core, and legs. The last one anyone could guess at.
To be able to control your weapon perfectly was required for any good warrior. If Chu Shen could control his weapon reasonably good in a waterfall then he could control it flawlessly outside of the waterfall. If he was ever able to perfectly control his weapon inside the waterfall than his would have reached the pinnacle.
After his body became exhausted and sore he once again circulated his Qi according to the technique. When he had first started his Qi had only been able to penetrate his skin. Now his Qi could penetrate the muscles surrounding the skin. Not only that but he was able to circulate it up to fifteen times in a row rather than just once.
The more times you could circulate your Qi the deeper the Qi could sink into the body. Chu Shen could now be considered as reaching the middle of the second level of the technique. For every ten circulations there would be critical point before the next stage could be reached.
Unfortunately there was no longer a major increase in his strength but rather only a pound or two was added after an hour of training. Compared to his 4800 pounds of strength it was indeed lacking.
After Chu Shen had done this he went over to the caves of isolation. These were actually small caves with isolating formations set up inside. This was a specially prepared place for those who needed to breakthrough without being disturbed.
All noise could be cut off and any Qi released during the breakthrough would be contained.
Chu Shen turned on the noise cancelling formation before calling out to his master. Ti Wu immediately appeared. After studying the area around them and Chu Shen he nodded.
“Not bad kid, not bad at all. This is indeed a proper place for breakthroughs. Anyways do you know why you had such a massive increase in strength before when you tempered yourself using the <Void King> technique but now the results are lacking?”
“No master.”
“I didn’t think so. Let me explain it in a different way. When you wish to forge out the impurities of a metal you pound on it until the impurities are gone correct?”
“Yes master.”
“Well what if the metal is not pure enough but you can't pound out any more impurities?”
“Well master, I would either make the fire hotter by adding more wood or changing the type of fire.”
“Exactly. Your body has been tempered as much as possible by the docile null Qi in your body. So instead we must either change the fire or add more fuel. Since when you get stronger your Qi will naturally become stronger and more plentiful you will be able to make more progress.”
“Unfortunately the increase of Qi from the Dragon to the Tiger stage is almost negligible. Only when you enter into the Martial Student Stage will there be a major increase.”
“So instead we will use Void Qi. I have been scraping the excess Qi from your meridians for a while now and have stored up enough. I will be injecting your body with Void Qi and you will circulate it according to the technique. Are you ready?”
“Yes master."

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 35: Of Course!</h1>
 
Chu Shen braced himself. After all, his master was famous for putting him through extremely painful processes so it with him warning Chu Shen before hand it was undoubtedly going to be painful beyond comparison.
His master had him sit down in the lotus position. His master floated above him, a barely visible figure glowing above his head. He floated downwards until he was eye to eye with Chu Shen, if he had his eyes open of course.
His hands glowed with a greenish blue hue for a second before transforming into a sinister inky darkness. The Void Qi immediately put out his spiritual Qi, truly living up to its name leaving not even a trace but absorbing it completely.
“Get ready. It starts now.” Reaching out his hand he lightly rested them on Chu Shen’s bare chest. Earlier he had him uncover his upper body in preparation. Without a sound the Void Qi surged into his body.
The Qi entered his body’s meridians through his chest’s acupuncture points. As the Qi flowed Ti Wu gave up his control over the Qi and let Chu Shen control it. The Void Qi circulated according the <Void King> technique.
The Qi went around once and as it did it started to penetrate the outer muscles and skin like before. It would not penetrate deeper until Chu Shen had advanced his understanding of the technique.
With the Void Qi his strength increased dramatically. Suddenly it went from 4800 pounds to 4820 pounds. Every time he rotated his Qi it increased. Upon the second rotation it added on another 25 pounds and each time it rotated once more another five pounds plus the last times circulation was added. It came up to a terrifying 5225 pounds! This was an addition of 425 pounds, an almost 20% increase in his already tremendous strength!
Then the eleventh circulation came, now it added on not 65 pounds but rather 130 pounds! Almost directly doubling the last addition of strength! It made sense because upon reaching the eleventh circulation it meant that person would have reached the second stage of the technique.
The twelfth circulation added on 140 pounds! This was once again doubling the previous circulations amount. It finally stopped at the fifteenth circulation of Qi. His strength was now at 5975 pounds, that meant he had gained 750 pounds of strength just from one circulation! His strength was now at almost 150% compared to others in the same stage.
But that was not the only thing Chu Shen had gained, far from it. Let us not forget that the <Void King> technique also strengthened the skin. Before Chu Shen’s skin could be considered as hard as stone. Now his skin was as strong as impure iron. While this was not quite enough to simply let a Dragon stage warrior to bash at him with impunity, he could definitely take a minor blow without worrying too much.
Now that Chu Shen had reached his limit he had to reset himself if he wished to circulate the Void Qi again.
Ti Wu upon sensing the circulations had stopped he once again took control of the Void Qi. As he did he sensed the amount missing was almost 10%, a terrifying amount for Chu Shen to absorb. This was all the Void Qi Ti Wu was willing to spare on Chu Shen’s training and Ti Wu had calculated that this was also the limit of Chu Shen’s willpower.
Speaking of willpower….
Ti Wu thought it odd that Chu Shen had not uttered a single peep when had been absorbing the Void Qi. Even the toughest of men would have groaned in agony at the very least. Unfortunately Ti Wu had been absorbed in making sure nothing went wrong with the Void Qi to observe his disciples facial expressions.
Glancing up at his face Ti Wu saw that Chu Shen’s face had on a pleasant expression, like that of a tourist. Sensing something wrong Chu Shen opened his eyes.
“Are we going to start a second time master or should we stop here?” Chu Shen had on an innocent expression as he looked at Ti Wu.
“Tell me, did you feel anything abnormal?”
“Besides the Qi you put into me Master, no I didn’t.”
“No pain? No pain at all?”
“No master I felt no discomfort.”
Master Ti Wu had an astonished expression on his face. Slowly his eyebrows furrowed in concentration before his face suddenly showed some enlightenment. “Of course of course. Why didn’t I think of that! It’s perfectly natural.”
“What master?”
“The reason you had no pain was of course because of your Void Constitution! Your body rejects all other types of Qi except Void Qi! In order to strengthen your body it has to absorb energy. Your body rejects this energy which is what causes the pain, as a matter of fact it’s not just you.”
“Everyone rejects Qi being put into their body, it’s only natural after all it is a foreign thing. But instead because of your constitution your body naturally absorbs the Void Qi to its highest extent without rejecting it, thereby strengthening your body while not causing pain!”
“Master that makes no sense though, otherwise my Null Qi would not have caused me any pain either.”
“Oh phooey! You can’t even talk of Null Qi and Void Qi as though they are the same! Null Qi is merely an altered version of Void Qi and comparing the two is like comparing a volcano to the sun. One is filled with the impurities of earth and ash while the other is pure energy.”
“How can your body accept a watered down version of what it wants while it is filled with hints of martial Qi. It’s like an alcoholic who has tasted the finest wine then pouring that fine wine into a jug of water and then giving it to him. Of course he would accept it reluctantly if that was the only thing given to him but he would always have his heart set on that pure fine wine.”
“I would have come to this conclusion faster but since all the Void Constitution Sect members were patriarchs I never got to teach them. That’s why I didn’t recognize it straight off.”
“Thank you master for enlightening me. Do you think we should continue though?”
“Of course we should. I have enough Qi for nine more times, use it wisely.”
Chu Shen managed to complete the technique another 9 times. Now his strength had gone from 4800 to 16550 pounds in single day. However, once Chu Shen reached this point he felt like his body would burst. After he told his master Ti Wu decided to stop after the tenth circulation.
“If you try and strengthen your body anymore it might burst. Because of that we can’t train your body anymore. Use this time left to get used to your strength.”
Afterwards Chu Shen went back to his room. He still had six more days before he had to go to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 36: Hidden Troubles & Relief</h1>
 
Inside one of the small huts that posed as student living there was an elderly teacher meeting with a sixteen year-old. He was dressed in a silver robe with the character for Chu on the back (楚). If Chu Shen was here he would recognize him as one of the arrogant Dragon Stage students.
Chu Liang cupped his hands and bowed slightly. “My thanks for notifying me.”
“Your welcome. Be careful though, you are not the only one going to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. I believe your older brother Chu Goto is going as well.”
“Thank you for the information teacher, I will take my leave.”
“As you wish student.”
Chu Liang kept a peaceful smile on his face until the teacher was gone. After that his face suddenly transformed into a hideous expression. ‘With the most talented kids going to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion I am sure that guy will be there.’
‘If he gets a powerful treasure now then when the freshmen competition happens next month I am sure to lose. I can’t throw away the face of the main sect to a branch member.’
“Arrrrgh” Chu Liang howled in despair. He truly couldn’t stand this situation. Him, a proud talent of the Chu Sect, would be brought to despair by a mere branch member. While he wasn’t a superior talent he could not be called average in the Chu Sect.
Thinking back on the teacher’s words he saw a light at the end of the tunnel. ‘Hmm. If I can get a proper weapon and armor then my power would increase greatly. However if I could do so, so could Chu Shen and with his powers it’s even more likely.’
‘The only way I can get ahead of him is by making sure he gains no treasures in the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.’ Chu Liang frowned as he followed this line of reasoning. ‘But I don’t have the strength. With his talent I am sure they let him pick out some good techniques from the library, not to mention he’s at the peak of the Dragon Stage while I am at the 8th level.’
‘However..’ He smiled as a sudden thought occurred. ‘If I have my brother help me we could suppress him so that he gains nothing. After all, older brother Chu Goto is in the Martial Practitioner Stage. With his cultivation level he can suppress Chu Shen to death!’
After he thought of this he pulled out a sound transmission talisman. “Hey older brother, I have slight problem I think you can help me with. See here’s the deal……..”
............................................................................................................................................
Chu Shen stretched out his back. “Ahhh, that felt good.”
KnockKnock
He glanced at the door. He had just finished cultivating for three hours straight though it seemed he had reached a bottleneck and couldn’t advance any faster. Soon he would have to go into secluded cultivation and attack one of his meridians to fully reach the Martial Realm. Getting up he opened his door.
It was Master Lang. “Chu Shen, I received a letter from your dad.”
Chu Shen wasn’t surprised. His dad had often worried about him and cared for him deeply when he was at home. Honestly he was surprised that his dad had not sent a letter before.
“Oh? Thank you Master Lang, should I read it now?”
“Yes, after this we will be heading directly to the Heavenly Treasure Palace and I don’t think you want other people prying into your personal life.”
“You are right as always Master Lang.”
After handing over the envelope, Master Lang left immediately saying, “Alright Chu Shen, go ahead and open it. I will leave you to your privacy. If afterwards you wish to share it with me you may.”
Nodding in agreement Chu Shen shut the door and opened the envelope. Upon opening it there was nothing there. The only thing there was some writing at the top. It said ‘Blood Confirmation’ and below it was a black square.
Chu Shen bit his thumb and placed it on square. Afterwards black symbols and characters appeared. All of this was due to a mystical art called Blood Messaging. Until blood related to the writer of the message dripped upon the black square on the message, the writing would not appear.
The message read as follows.
‘Dear son, I hope you are doing well in the Chu Sect’s school. I have heard rumors about you and your cultivation speed. It seems I must find that wandering cultivator to fully express my gratitude. However, something has come up. As you know I planned on waiting to rescue your mother until five years from now so that you can join me but I did not. You see, I started investigating the matter and found an opportunity. I was able to successfully save your mother from her captives but in return we must go into hiding. I will not be able to contact you nor you me. So I hope you can continue to grow stronger. In five years I will meet you on the steps of the Majestic Sword Academy. Grow stronger son, we shall both depend upon you.’
Chu Shen was shocked and started to cry. After ten minutes he recovered. He gathered himself together. It seemed as though he must indeed become stronger, strong enough to protect both his parents. After recomposing himself he walked out the door to Master Lang.
Master Lang said not a word after looking at Chu Shen’s red, puffy eyes. “Chu Shen, are you ready to go?” He pondered for a second. Over the past five days he had done some physical exercises and sparred twice inside the Voids Hand. Indeed he had successfully remastered his physical strength. Now he no longer shattered his cups when he went to drink.
“Yes Master Lang, I am ready. Let us set out for the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 37: Pavilion Revealed</h1>
 
Chu Shen and Master Lang found themselves in front of another Thousand Miles Formation. One of the elders was in front of the formation. Upon seeing him Master Lang immediately went up to him and asked him to open the formation.
“This is Chu Shen, one of the students going to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. Open the formation for me and him.”
The elder nodded his head at first but then looked sharply at Master Lang. “I am sorry teacher, but you can’t go with this student. Only certain teachers are allowed to go with the students and I am familiar with them all, you are not one of them.”
Master Lang sighed. He then pulled out a badge with a sword carved into it. The sword was golden and above it was five silver daggers. Upon seeing this the elder in charge of the transportation formations immediately drew in a deep breath. This was unexpectedly the principals badge! Seeing this meant the unknown teacher was only second to the principal herself! Inwardly he cursed.
“I see I was wrong. Please forgive me respected teacher, I shall activate the formation right away.” The elder bowed before motioning them to get on the formation platform. After making several hand-signs the formation lit up.
As the formation activated the elder asked a question. “If I may respected teacher, can you tell me your name?”
Master Lang nodded. “I am the new teacher for the advanced artificer class.” With that the formation activated completely and the whirlpool devoured both master and pupil.
............................................................................................................
When they appeared they were in a small building. Other students were there along with five teachers. Altogether there was a total of 21 students. They were missing four.
After a short while all of the students were here. When they were all gathered a person came in the building from the outside.
“Good, everyone is here.” Unexpectedly it was Chu Tang A.K.A. Stone Face.
“I am Chu Tang, the person in charge of this expedition into the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. Inside the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion is numerous amounts of not only weapons but armor and unique artifacts. Upon removing an artifact from its stand you will undergo a test in an illusionary realm. It will at most cause some slight mental damage if you fail the test so don’t be worried.”
“However upon failing once you will be expelled from the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion and prevented from taking another treasure. Know your limits. If you try and take a treasure meant for a stronger cultivator the test afterwards may kill you instead of just damaging you slightly.”
“Do you understand?” The students all nodded.
“Good, along with you students there will also be another 25 people joining us from the Chu Sect. Don’t cause conflict with them. Follow me outside.”
Everyone left the building to go outside. There they waited for several minutes before another group led by a heroic looking man in a gold robe walked out of the building next to theirs.
“Since we are all here, let us go to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion now.” Chu Tang proposed this idea after the two groups met up.
“Yes I agree brother Stone Face.” Upon hearing this Chu Tang’s face twitched a little. Then with a flourish he walked down the path.
Soon they neared a spot on the ground surrounded by forest. There was nothing special about this spot except for the black sphere hovering above the ground.
The heroic looking man in the golden robe faced the crowd. “Alright everybody, here is the deal. Go in, pick up treasures, then leave. The academy and the Chu Sect will buy any surplus weapons you pick up inside. Also, you will only have four hours before the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion departs. Where? No one knows so make sure to leave before then.”
Meanwhile inside the Voids Hand Ti Wu was staring at the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion in shock. “How could this be here.” He muttered. “That senior said he wanted it to travel all the realms but I thought he was kidding! Never did I think to this day I would encounter this here"
They were all handed devices that would beep every fifteen minutes to keep track of time. Then they all waited. None of the students knew what they were waiting for exactly.
Eventually the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion opened up with a grandiose gesture. The black sphere shimmered before suddenly changing shape. Now in its place was a large black pavilion floating in midair.
Leading up to the pavilion was a black staircase and inside was a small doorway. On the other side of the door there was nothing but none of the students doubted that something was on the other side.
“Alright students and fellow disciples. The four hours start now, go quickly now.” Chu Tang reminded them all to hurry up. The young fellows present activated the devices given to them before hurrying up the steps.

Chu Shen approached the doorway. As each student stepped through the doorway they would suddenly disappear. Soon it was Chu Shen’s turn. He stepped through the doorway and like those before him, disappeared from this world.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 38: Inside the Pavilion</h1>
 
Heading into the pavilion Chu Shen had no idea what to expect. Inside he found a whole other world.
Looking around Chu Shen found himself on a flat disk of land. It was floating among the stars, there were many buildings on the disk of land. On the side of the buildings were carved names. The buildings were enormous, thousands of feet across with multiple levels. However that was only the buildings on the left. The ones on the right were much smaller.
Looking to his left, Chu Shen saw it said Pagoda of Mortals, beside it was another building. This one said Pagoda of Martial Mortals, and yet another building said Pagoda of Natural World Mortals. Other buildings said Pagoda of Celestial Mortal, Pagoda of Demigods, Pagoda of Lower Gods, Pagoda of Gods, Pagoda of Higher Gods, and finally there was the Pagoda of Universal Gods.
Many of the students were looking around curiously. However, those members of the Chu Sect set off towards the the Pagoda of Mortals and the Pagoda of Martial Mortals. One of them turned towards the students.
“Hey, are you all going to stand there gawking? If you are in the Mortal realms go to the Pagoda of Mortals, if you’re in the Martial realm go to the Pagoda of Martial Mortals. Those are the only ones you can enter anyways, if you don’t believe me you can try and enter a higher pagoda than that, though you’ll regret.”
With that the Chu Sect member turned around and left. As he did he sighed. Now there would be more competition but if he hadn’t said anything his master would have berated him.
Hearing those words the students looked at each other. “Did you hear what they said?” “I don’t believe it they must be trying to fool us.”
With that one of the students headed toward a pagoda at the right. As he opened the door and stepped in his face turned pale and he stumbled backwards. Blood spurt out of his mouth and he fell on the ground groaning.
“Ugggh. There’s a horrible pressure in the building, I think only those at the Emperor Stage could stand up to it.” The person who had warned them had almost reached the Pagoda of Martial Mortals when he saw the scene.
“Haha! That’s the first test of the Pagoda’s. If you can’t even stand up to the pressure how do you expect to pass the test!” With that the man strode into the pagoda.
Chu Shen saw all this and then turned towards the left-most pagoda. He walked into the pagoda. As he did a formless pressure bore down on him. His body grew slightly heavier as it pressed down on him. Chu Shen didn’t even notice it. With his body as strong as it was, how could something so small bother him?
Unfortunately as he walked in he did not notice the two people who were staring at his back.
“That’s him little bro?”
“Yeah that’s him big bro. Will you help me?”
“Of course little bro, that’s what brothers are there for anyways.” Together they walked towards the Pagoda of Mortals.
There was a long hallway filled with doors. Chu Shen opened a door and looked in. There was lots of weapons inside, though they were all swords. Sensing the ripples of energy he could tell it was merely a Low-grade weapon.
Advancing down the hallway other students trickled in. Periodically Chu Shen would open a door and check on the grade of weapons. Once he opened a door with a mark on it. All the other doors had no marking on them, they were all blank. Upon seeing the marked door Chu Shen had become excited to see what it was but inside there was nothing.
Or rather, there was merely scraps of metal and broken weapons. The materials weren’t even high quality. How could the materials used to craft Mortal Weapons be worth anything? Disappointed Chu Shen closed the door.
Eventually though Chu Shen reached a stair case. Climbing up it the pressure suddenly increased. Of course even this amount could not bother Chu Shen but now he noticed it. ‘Oh, this must be that pressure they were talking about.’
Opening up a door he found there was Mid-grade Mortal weapons inside. Turning back to the staircase Chu Shen climbed up one more level. Opening up the door he nodded. It was indeed High-grade Mortal weapons.
Thinking hard he realized what he truly needed was not weapons since his living steel hammer was better than anything but rather armor. Crafting armor was actually harder than crafting weapons because each armor needed to suit the user perfectly.
As he opened up each door to glance inside suddenly someone grabbed him. A silver colored energy covered his eyes. Withdrawing his hammer he swung it wildly behind him at the assailant. The hammer whistled through the air when suddenly it was stopped.
The person spoke in a deep husky voice, obviously to mask what they sounded like. “I’m not going to hurt you. Just prevent you from getting a weapon. No personal feelings right?”
Chu Shen was tossed inside one of the empty rooms that he had seen before. As he turned around the door was shut. A muffled voice came from the outside. “We locked the door with an array but don’t worry. It will unlock ten minutes before the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion leaves. So just sit tight for a couple hours.”
Footsteps echoed as they walked away. Chu Shen was angry that something like this had happened but wasn’t too upset that he had lost. Because of the Qi covering his eyes he knew his opponent was in the Martial realm The current him, no matter how strong his physical body was, couldn’t compare to a Martial realm warrior.
Ti Wu inside the Voids Hand had been ready to make a move if they had truly tried to harm Chu Shen. Since they didn’t harm Chu Shen he didn’t reveal himself. Besides, it was only some Mortal weapons. Chu Shen could always forge some instead of picking them up like rocks at the wayside.

Chu Shen tried the door handle but no matter what it wouldn’t budge. He sighed, seemed like he was truly trapped here. Sitting down Chu Shen started cultivating using the <Voids Child> technique and waited.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 39: It’s The End</h1>
 
While Chu Shen cultivated in forced isolation the teachers outside were conversing.
“Are you ready for the expedition?” Asked Chu “Stone Face” Tang.
“Yes Sir” They replied.
“Good, let’s go then.” With that the teachers along with the two leaders from both factions lept into the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.
This was the true reason why they had come, not to cheer on their students but rather to seize a treasure. Most of these teachers had a deep cultivation. Upon reaching a level like this it became increasingly hard to find an appropriate weapon.
After all, who could craft weapons for those at the Nature Stage and above? No one could craft such a weapon but a six star artificer and good luck convincing those proud and aloof artificers if you were merely a teacher.
Therefore teachers of outstanding students could go to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion to pick out some rewards. They could only go for two hours though, leaving the first and last hours to their students.
Master Lang and the other teachers followed them inside. When Master Lang went in he glanced at the Pagoda of Mortals. According to what he knew, his student would be in there.
Chu Tang looked back. “Master Lang, you know it’s forbidden to interfere with the students. Just follow along to a pagoda to pick your reward.” Of course Chu Tang knew of Master Lang.
A seven star artificer joining a school ran by the Chu Sect was a big deal. Because of this Chu Tang had memorized Master Lang’s appearance and was pleasantly surprised by the fact the student he was so bemused by was actually his disciple.
Master Lang nodded. “Of course Master Chu Tang is correct, I shall follow your suggestion.” With this said he flew towards the Pagoda of Natural World Mortals.
Since Master Lang was a seven star artificer gathering items such as these could be considered as both unimportant and yet absolutely crucial.
Since he could forge items like these he did not lack anything of this caliber. At the same time though by gathering these he saved time forging them and also gathered other inscriptions. To a true artificer what they desired most was to expand their knowledge. By gathering items with unique inscriptions such as these he could forge more diverse weapons and even become inspired to create completely new ones.
After a while two hours were up. With several different items Master Lang and the other teachers left to wait for their students. Outside waiting there was already seven other students who had unfortunately failed the tests at some point. Most of these were students who after gathering what they needed decided to test their luck with a higher level item.
Meanwhile Chu Liang had gathered an entire set of equipment for himself along with several spares. ‘Chu Shen can’t possibly beat me now. I have such powerful items not to mention some of these unique artifacts. There’s no way I can lose.’
As the time ran out more and more students lost their qualifications and had to leave the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. This was the reason the Majestic Sword Academy was called the number 2 school on the continent after the Imperial Academy. With the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion and the items they extracted the school had enormous funds. With these funds they could buy techniques and resources for both the Chu Sect and its school.
Soon it was only fifteen minutes from the time the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion would close. If the rest of the students weren’t out yet they would become trapped inside.
Out of the 50 students 43 of them were already out. Soon there was only one left. Master Lang had an anxious look on his face. Where is Chu Shen!!!!
………………………………………………………………..
Chu Shen was still cultivating when Master Ti Wu stopped him. “Chu Shen, you had better get up now.”
“Huh, why master?”
“There’s only ten minutes left now. The lock is gone.”
“Oh. That’s good.”
With that Chu Shen walked over and pushed open the door. It opened quietly. He started to walk down the staircase when Ti Wu reminded him. “Hey, if you don’t want to disappear along with this place you might want to hurry up.”
While he said this out loud internally he opposed himself. ‘Of course, that wouldn’t be a bad suggestion if that expert wasn’t lying. But I can’t trust my disciples lives to the mutterings of an old man.’
Chu Shen realizing this immediately started running. He had 7 minutes left. Soon he reached the entrance of the Pagoda of Mortals. 2 minutes remaining. He ran towards the exit of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. 1 minute left.
He was almost to the entrance. 300 yards. 45 seconds left. 200 yards. 30 seconds. 100 yards. 50 yards. 25 yards. 15 seconds. The world started shaking. The ground itself split. 10 yards from the exit Chu Shen was dodging cracks left and right. Suddenly a boulder jutted upwards in front of him. He fell down less than an arm’s length from the exit. 0 seconds left.
The exit disappeared. The world around Chu Shen continued crumbling. The black pavilion and staircase merged together to create the mysterious black sphere. Without a sound it disappeared.
Master Lang had a frozen face on. Unexpectedly Chu Shen was gone. Hurriedly he pulled out a life tablet. Since Chu Shen had bonded with it, if he had died the life tablet would no longer be bound to him. As he scanned it he found the bond was still intact with that he sighed in relief.
Chu Tang came up to Master Lang. “I am sorry for your loss Master Lang. He was a marvelous talent.”
“What do you mean. He’s still alive. Hahahahaha. He’s still alive, see, see, SEE! HAHAHAHA!” Master Lang started pointing to the tablet, insanity temporarily taking over him. Chu Tang shook his head.
Both masters knew there was no way Chu Shen would survive. To satisfy their curiosity an elder of the sect had set out to find where the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion went to. Unfortunately, nothing went as planned. All they had to do was wait five years but unexpectedly in the fourth year the life tablet of the elder had shattered.
After that it was determined that since even an elder at the Cosmos Stage couldn’t survive that no one could. It was forbidden ever since to stay on the pavilion when it disappears. Sighing Chu Tang condemned Chu Shen to land of dead.
Chu Liang had a frozen face before suddenly cracking a smile. Heavens fortune was with him! Now he could become the champion of the freshman. And no one could blame him since he planned to delay Chu Shen and not kill him. Ha. Everything turned out okay.
Soon, no one would ever remember the young genius, once called Chu Shen.
