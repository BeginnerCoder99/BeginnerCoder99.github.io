    <h1 class = "chapter-title">Arc 4 [Magicians World</h1>

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 101 - Look Out!</h1>

Chu Shen and Lucas waited inside the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion for a little while. But eventually they disappeared again. When they did, they had reappeared in the forest outside the edge of a large open field.

“Alright, let’s go ahead and get our bearings so that…” Lucas said as he started looking around. But he was interrupted halfway.

“Duck!” Chu Shen yelled. Instantly Lucas ducked, a result of his trust in Chu Shen’s judgement. A stream of fire shot past Lucas, the fire being so hot that it left burn marks on his fake skin even when it had missed him by over a foot. The fire was in a fan pattern, spreading outwards and slicing through trees like butter.

At the same time as the stream of fire, large explosions started going off in the distance. Chu Shen glanced towards where the noises were coming from and immediately became flabbergasted.

There, on opposite sides of the field, was two large armies facing each other. In front and middle rows were men dressed in armor and wielding swords and spears.

Currently they were charging at high speeds towards each other before meeting halfway. Huge gaps could be seen in the formation. Chu Shen could see the corpse of some of them behind the charging army. But they made no sense.

Some of them had been frozen or lit on fire. Others were completely reduced to ash. What could have caused such devastation? Chu Shen could only think of a clash between an army of cultivators.

Both sides started fighting, showing frightening battle prowess. Qi surged as blades made of the elements sliced opponents in half, armor blocked weapons and warriors used formations to fight together against the enemy. 

In the back, standing on large earthen walls, were rows of men dressed in robes holding staffs embedded with crystals. Compared to the robed men, the armored men seemed to outnumber them 5-1 in both armies.

Chu Shen rubbed his eyes for a second. Just what was going on? This seemed way too weird to be anything he could think of. The robed men on both sides seemed to be chanting something before all of them lifted their hands.

Immediately, a flurry of fire, ice, thunder, and various other elements surged toward the other side. One of this barrage of the elements came close to Chu Shen. Like last time this was a huge fan like wave of fire. 

Chu Shen and Lucas dodged like they had done last time before looking at the battle field. The armed men on both sides seemed to be taking heavy casualties from this frighteningly powerful long range bombardment. It was too chaotic though to be sure which side was winning.

There was a robed man on one side that had been chanting for a long time. Suddenly, the man thrust his arms towards the battles and said something that Chu Shen could faintly hear.

A huge whirlwind of fire sprang up on the enemy's army. At the same time, a man in golden armor which was on the opposite side as the robed man shot forward. The whirlwind melted men around it, lighting them on fire.

The man in golden armor spread his arms wide as he closed in on the whirlwind like he wanted to hug it. A huge burst of energy which completely shocked Chu Shen came out of the man. The energy was in the shape of a bear and gave the whirlwind a bear hug. The bear snuffed out the fire, though the man in golden armor seemed to be exhausted.

The fight continued with other great shows of power going back and forth. Meanwhile, Chu Shen and Lucas backed up away from the fight and were having a hushed conversation.

“So what do you think of this situation Chu Shen? You have some experience as a cultivator so what does it look like to you?” Lucas had a hopeful expression on his face as he stared at Chu Shen. 

Chu Shen shrugged helplessly. “To be honest, I am not sure. These people, they are using fire, ice, and thunder to attack. All of these are elements. You should know only beasts can use the elements and cultivators have to be at the Natural Realm or have an innate constitution.”

Chu Shen glanced towards the battlefield. “But there are so many people out there, at least a thousand on each side. There cannot be so many with an innate constitution. At the same time, they are not as powerful as a person in the Natural Realm.”

“If I had to guess, I would say the robed men were at the Martial Warrior stage and the armored men were at the Martial Scholar stage. Some like that golden armored man or the robed man that made that whirlwind of fire might be at the Martial Army Stage.”

Lucas sighed. “So what you are telling me is that this situation makes no sense? They aren’t powerful enough, and there is too many to be unique? Great. So what do we do now then?”

“Well it’s not our fight. So how about we just try to find the nearest town. There we should be able to find some answers.” Chu Shen said. Lucas nodded and both started walking away from the huge battle.

They could still hear the loud explosions behind them as they left the area. After a couple miles, they found a large road. Surprisingly the road was congested with many wagons.

Chu Shen thought with the fight going on, they would have tried to escape. Walking up to one of the wagons Chu Shen asked them a few questions. What he found out was a bit complicated.

Those two forces that were fighting a little ways away was actually two middle class sects that had been at an uneasy truce. The reason for this truce was that there was a third sect that was bigger than they both were that was in charge of the city Buldag, a fairly large trade city. However, this third sect had been experiencing a decline in talent.

As a result, there had been a call for a stronger force to take over the city lord’s position. The Alteria Empire, one of the superpowers of this world, had decided to agree to this proposal. As a result, these two sects had declared war on each other to settle this once and for all.

When Chu Shen asked why they weren’t fleeing from the fight, the wagon’s driver laughed. He explained it quite simply. He was a small time merchant that specialized in military related items. 

So when a small war like this broke out, wouldn’t they need supplies, bandages, replacement weapons and so on? The wagon driver was just making some extra coin. His safety wasn’t in danger since they wouldn’t stoop so low as to steal from a poor merchant like him.

Chu Shen finally realized why there were so many wagons. These people were only trying to take advantage of the war to sell some stuff. Lucas came up to him after he was done talking with the wagon driver. “So, now that you know what’s going on, do you know what we should do?”

Chu Shen nodded. “Yeah, we need to go to the city and learn some things. Like how can those people use the elements, what kind of power systems is here. All of those things are needed so that we don’t become caught off guard.”

Lucas agreed. “Alright then. We need to get to Buldag.”




















<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 102 - The Library</h1>

“Wow, it’s so big!” Chu Shen exclaimed as he looked around at the surrounding buildings. They were huge masses of stone and brick, towering over the streets.

Lucas shook his head. “Stop it Chu Shen. Seriously, you look like a star struck tourist. Besides, you saw bigger buildings on Sparta.”

“I know but still, doesn’t it impress you in the slightest?” Chu Shen said, glancing at Lucas before turning back to stare at the buildings.

Lucas looked at the buildings. “Maybe, but only because they actually made such huge buildings with such primitive technology. Then again, they don’t need cranes with how strong you guys are.”

Chu Shen nodded. “Yeah, some cultivators who don’t like fighting become masons, miners, all kinds of different crafts. Having a cultivator tends to make any project progress much faster than using regular mortals.”

“Makes sense. Anyways, we need to find the library if we are going to find out anything.” Lucas said sighing.

“Yeah, let’s ask.” Chu Shen ran up to one of the food vendors that was on the side of the street. Soon after he came back holding a small skewer with grilled meat and peppers on it.

“So he gave you directions and free food?” Lucas said, a bit incredulously.

“Yeah. They can’t resist a cute kid. I am still thirteen you know. Come one, the library is this way.” Chu Shen ran down one of the streets while Lucas followed, shaking his head.

After a couple turns, Chu Shen and Lucas were standing in front of a large imposing building. It was huge, made of solid marble. Huge marble columns stood in front of the building propping up a large porch. A door much too large was set behind the columns in the wall. There was a flight of stairs leading up to the door as well. 

Chu Shen and Lucas walked up to the door. Entering, they found themselves inside a well lit room. Comfortable carpet was spread on the ground while sunlight streamed down from many small windows in the roof and sides of the wall.

There was large bookshelves farther into the room with some tables off to the side, most likely for studying. A lady, probably a librarian, glanced up from a book she was reading at a desk when they walked in. Putting the book down, she walked up to them. “Yes, may I help you?”

Chu Shen was about to step forward but thought better of it. After all, he was a kid and Lucas, even though he was a kid as well, looked like a burly man. Chu Shen nudged Lucas. “Go on, ask her for some books on warrior stuff or something.”

Lucas kind of stumbled forward. He reached his hand out to the librarian. “Hello, my name is Lucas. I am looking for books regarding the manipulation of the elements and other ways to fight. Specifically research on those topics.”

The librarian shook his hand, though she looked taken back by the obviously contrast between his manner of speech and barbaric looks. “Well, that is a common topic. If you go to aisle 9  and look at the third shelf from the top you should find some books on mages. The fifth shelf will have books on warriors. If you are looking for an introduction book there is some available here for the young one.”


Lucas nodded. “Yes, that would be much appreciated. Thank you.” He turned to Chu Shen. “Alright, I’ll go find those books while you read that introduction.”

Chu Shen gave his approval and let the librarian lead him to the tables set off to the side. She set down a thin book in front of him. “I think this will help you out, there is a picture book I can get instead if you can’t handle this heavy reading.”


Chu Shen almost facepalmed. Almost. He shook his head. “No I think I should be good. Thank you for your concern though.”

The librarian shrugged. “Alright then. Please ask me if you need anything. You won’t be bothering me at all.” The librarian went back to her desk and started reading her book again.

Chu Shen picked up the book. [The Basics of Warriors and Mages]. Seems simple enough. Chu Shen started reading. But he became intrigued on the ideas introduced in the book.

According to the book, there were warriors, mages, and battle mages. Each one was decided at birth, there was no growth. Apparently each warrior and mage had something called the ‘magic source’. This was where mana was stored at. Chu Shen assumed the magic source was a dantian and mana was Qi.

Mages had mana rivers, where mana was absorbed in a river. However, each river must be forced to go into the magic source, making it bigger. Each Mage was born with a certain amount of blocked rivers, they could never make another river. It was something they were born with, nothing more.

As for Warriors, they had a mana network. It was small amounts of mana that went to their magic source from all over their body. This amount of mana was very small compared the mana rivers. However, the warriors could make their mana network expand, allowing more mana to come in at once.

Battle mages was someone with both a mana network and mana rivers.

Immediately Chu Shen became mesmerized by this. Obviously mana rivers was the major meridians! The mana network must be the minor meridians! The book however, ended there. 

What did make him curious was that while there was pictures, there was none with the meridian network. Instead it was pictures of men in armor or with robes and a staff. Obviously it was images of mages and warriors.

Lucas came back holding only one book. “Here you go Chu Shen. I figured a book like this would be best. After all, its when there are comparisons that all the tiny details are revealed.” He set down the book, [Warriors VS Mages: Pros and Cons].

Chu Shen gave Lucas the book he had just gotten done reading. “Well this world has some interesting ideas for cultivation. Truly interesting things. You know the basics for cultivation so you should understand the significance of this.”

Chu Shen started reading the book Lucas gave him. It gave in depth analysis of warriors and mages, giving him a very accurate description of the exact powers and limitations of the people here.

Mages mixed mana with the surrounding mana using it to enhance their attacks, making it much stronger than merely shooting out pure mana. However, they had to have time to mix their mana. They also had to visualize the manas form. As a result they would chant to help visualize their spells. They could also fire mana over a very long distance.

Mages also could not shoot out massive amounts of mana at once. The reason was because the mana river flowing inwards blocked the mana from coming in. So they had to fight against the flow of the mana river so they compared to warrior, they would need far more mana to get an equal attack.

Warriors used their mana network to rapidly shoot out mana. They widened their mana network so that more mana could be shot out at once. It even got to the point where they could shoot out their entire magic source worth of mana in one shot.

As a result, warriors became focused on speed and shooting massive amounts of mana to beat a mages long chant time. The only downside was that a warrior could not control their mana over long distance and must get in close combat to fight.

Also, a warriors mana network would increase a warrior's body strength far beyond that of a mages. So mages couldn’t run away from a warrior so mages could only stand and fight against a warrior of equal rank. 

Compared to mages, warriors could continue getting stronger and stronger. On paper it would seem as though warriors would easily out number mages when it came to power levels. 

However, in order to widen their mana network, they had to go through massive amounts of pain. The pain would also get worse exponentially. Compared to mages who only had to force a mana river to go into their dantian, a warrior had to go through many hardships to reach an equal footing.


Battle mages enjoyed the combination of both mana network and river. As a result, their spells could be cast faster or become more powerful compared to a regular mage. They were also physically stronger than mages but their mage rank would be higher than their warrior rank since they couldn’t deal with the pain.

Also, Chu Shen found out the ranking scale of the mages and warriors. They were quite simply listed into different ranks with a rank 1 being equal to a normal person. He compared it to his own power system and it lined up perfectly. The comparison he made was as followed.

Man/Tiger/Dragon = Rank 1
Student = Rank 2
Practitioner = Rank 3
Scholar = Rank 4
Warrior = Rank 5
Army = Rank 6
King = Rank 7
Emperor (1st part)  = Rank 8
Emperor (2nd part) = Rank 9


A Mage God was a mage born with all 7 mana rivers while a Warrior God was one that fully expanded their mana network. However, they could only become a rank 8 at best. Only battle mages could become rank 9 and were classified as Paragon Gods. To Chu Shen, this world was interesting. Very interesting indeed.






<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 103 - What's That?</h1>

Chu Shen didn’t stop researching there. He started looking into the specifics of how mages and warriors fight. What was the exact reason for the difference between them besides the mana network and mana rivers?

Chu Shen found out the reason quickly. Mages could fire long distance attacks but Warriors could only use melee or extremely close combat skills. It was confusing at first because there was no real reason given. However, Chu Shen remembered the soul.

The Major meridians, or mana river, was a channel that let the soul out. As a result the ability to control Qi at a long distance was given to mages. Warriors only had the Minor meridians which only let the soul out a tiny bit. This meant their ability to use Qi at a distance was severely limited.

So the differences between the two and reasons for it was found quickly by Chu Shen. Next, Chu Shen started finding out specific strategies Mages and Warriors used.

Warriors expanded their meridians allowing massive surges of Qi without backlash. As a result, warriors could use up their entire Qi reserve in one or two shots, giving them massive explosive strength but almost no stamina. It was especially true because they could not recover mana as fast as mages.

Mages however were different. Chu Shen learned earlier that Mages mixed their mana with the atmosphere and could only release small amounts of mana at once. Of course, it was because the mana rivers flowed against their own mana.

Mages had a specific system of spell casting. The spell casting system was put as this in one of Chu Shen’s books. It went in detail as to the specifics of spells since it was a very popular topic.

1>Beginning Success: Can cast spell using full chant with spellbook. 
2>Small Success: Can chant from memory. (Spell Rank = Mage Rank)
3> Medium Success: Can use abbreviated chant. (Spell Rank = Mage Rank -1)
4> Large Success: Can cast using only spell name. (Spell Rank = Mage Rank -2)
5> Perfection: Can insta-cast using only mental image. (Spell Rank = Mage Rank -3)

Rank 6-7 spells only have first 4 stages. God rank (Rank 8-9) spells only have the first 3 stages.

The way it worked was pretty basic. There was a note that to successfully cast a spell using an abbreviated chant one needed to be one rank above the spell. Using the spell name needed two ranks above the spell and insta-cast needed to be three ranks above the spells rank.

An example would be this. A Rank 5 mage can cast a Beginning/Small success Rank 5 spell. However, they can only cast a Medium Success Rank 4 spell, Large Success Rank 3 spell, and a Perfection Rank 2 spell. 

The reason behind this spell system was because a higher rank mage could assimilate more Qi with the atmosphere in a shorter amount of time. With that a mage could cast weaker spells almost instantly. Of course, Chu Shen realized this was correlated to the increase of the soul's power.

Looking at this, it was true that mages would be slow to use their most powerful attacks. Especially since each chant took 30 seconds. However, each rank spell was greater than an equal rank warrior by one. So a rank 2 spell equals a rank 3 warriors attack using 10% of his mana.
Chu Shen nodded. Using this as a basis, mages were good at spamming huge amounts of weak spells, a medium variety of average spells, or one large charge up attack.

Mages also used barriers to protect themselves. Barriers was simply an artifact that created a wall of energy between the mage and the enemy. It was only one direction however and the artifact itself was very expensive. It ran of Mana Cores from Magical beasts, their version of beast cores and primordial beasts.

Chu Shen immediately became interested in the artifact. They seemed to be a more advanced version of their own Primordial Pistols. Simply put, Chu Shen and Lucas could only release the energy inside a beast core in a stream of energy.

They could control, to some extent, the intensity and duration but this was on another level. This artifact creates a wall from energy. This meant they knew how to make constructs! If Chu Shen and Lucas could improve this artifacts control system, then they could have a much better option for the body shield for Lucas and many horizons would be opened as well.

Besides that, Chu Shen found something else also interesting. Apparently everyone here was born with an element. Something that so many people wanted and could be called a genius was as common as clouds here.

Also, there wasn’t a restriction like those with normal constitutions. They didn’t have to find places with more intense elemental Qi. They could absorb Qi, or mana, normally like Chu Shen did. 

Chu Shen didn’t know the reason. All he could think of was that it was normal to this realm. It was just the way they were. Maybe some sort of mutation in their soul was responsible.

Lucas stretched, immediately catching Chu Shen’s notice. “Hey, why are you stretching?”


Lucas shrugged. “Because we have been working on this research thing for almost three hours.”

Chu Shen nodded. “Okay, I get that is a long time. But why are you stretching? I mean, having a machine for a body does mean you don’t have to stretch or anything.”

Lucas stared at Chu Shen. “Ya know, I never really thought about it. Guess it’s a habit from when I still had my body.”

Chu Shen made a face at Lucas. “Well, it is a bit weird if you didn’t stretch or anything like that so I guess it’s okay.”

“Glad I have your permission.”


“Anyways Lucas, we need to get busy. As far as I can see we need to do a couple things. First, let me try and join a warriors association. The expansion of the minor meridians could be a major breakthrough. With that, I should be able to grow a lot more powerful.” 

Lucas shook his head. “I don’t think we should do that. I have too many secrets for us to be joining a group or something. If they found about the primordial pistols or my robotic body I could be in trouble. Plus I still want to work on making some more stuff. If we joined a group like that then I would have to constantly be on guard. It’s too limiting.”

Chu Shen nodded. “Well i guess that is true. So joining an organization like that isn’t so good. Not unless it has some more freedom with it. So what do you think we should do instead?”


Lucas furrowed his brow for a couple seconds before his face lit up. “Of course, we do like we always did! We just need to buy you the cultivation technique for warriors. The techniques should be cheap since warriors are supposed to be rare at high levels.”

“Great, except we have no money Lucas.”


“Then we hunt down some beasts and get some cores. With that we should be able to raise enough money to buy what we need.”


“That just might work Lucas. Let’s go hunt some beasts then.”


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 104 - Helping Kids In Need</h1>

Chu Shen and Lucas departed for a magic beast hunting zone, as it was called. It was forest infested with beasts that anyone could enter. The only downside was that sometimes powerful beasts would come to the forest and slaughter those it met.

Of course Chu Shen and Lucas could have flown on their jetpack to the forest. However, they had decided to enjoy a walk through the woods. Just enjoying nature instead of rushing.

They were walking and had just reached the top of a hill on the road when Lucas stopped. “Hey Chu Shen, look at that. Do you see that group of people down there? Don’t they seem a bit weird.”


Chu Shen followed where Lucas was pointing. He was pointing at a group consisting of several wagons worth of people. Actually they were all kids. Surrounding the wagons was a dozen or so armed men on horseback.

Chu Shen shook his head. “Nope, I don’t see what’s so weird about them.”

Lucas sighed. “Well do you see how anxious they look? Those guards are nervous and the drivers are urging the horses on as fast as possible. I can even see a couple of the kids crying.”


“Really? How good are those eyes?” Chu Shen asked. 

“...... Good enough.” 

Chu Shen shrugged. “Well it’s not our problem, come on let’s go.” He started to walk down the road when Lucas grabbed his arm.

“Wait. I see a group coming down the road. About forty of them or so.” Chu Shen looked up at Lucas before doing a double take. His eyes were zoomed in like a camera’s telescopic lense.

What Lucas said next immediately took his mind off the ridiculousness of his eyes. “I think those kids might be in trouble. That group I saw has their weapons drawn and are in a huge rush. They are riding right for the kids.”

Chu Shen immediately looked down the path himself. Squinting, he could barely make out a dust cloud that was gradually getting closer. As he was looking, he noticed the group below them started becoming agitated.

One of the guards rode up close to the wagons for a minute. Then all of the guards wheeled around and rode towards the dust cloud. As they did, the guards drew their weapons.

Chu Shen sighed. “Alright Lucas. I can see there being a problem for them, but not for us. We can’t get involved in other people's problems.”

Lucas shook his head. “What am I supposed to do then? I can’t just stand by and see innocent kids killed. I just can’t!”

“How do you know they are going to be killed. Maybe they will only be captured.” Chu Shen knew how unlikely that would be though. Suddenly a flash of white light came from the two groups of men on horses. Turning, Chu Shen saw several of the guards had become ice statues. The two groups started to fight. 

“Chu Shen, I’m going to help those kids. You can either join me or watch but you can’t stop me.” Lucas stared Chu Shen right in the eye. 


They stood staring at each other for a little bit before Chu Shen glanced away sighing. “Fine Lucas, let’s do it then. I can’t really stand the idea of kids getting killed either you know.” 

Lucas nodded at Chu Shen but Chu Shen made a wait-a-moment gesture with his hand. “But there is one thing I want to clarify. We have to be able to win. While I don’t want to watch kids be killed, I also don’t want to be one of those dead kids either.”

“Fine. So what’s the plan.”
 
“Here is what we are going to do. We leave the five sniper drones in the air along with the holo-drone and beast core drones. Using the holo-drone make them all invisible, we should be able to take them by surprise.”

Chu Shen continued his plan. “We will also be armed with our primordial pistols and railguns so our firepower should be above our cultivation level. Now what we need to do is run down there and bypass the group of kids down there. 

“When we pass the men on the horses then I will scan their cultivation level with my spiritual sense while you let them breathe your explosive nanites. If they are weak enough, then we wait for them to be a little farther down the road and attack them.”

“What are we supposed to do if they are too strong?” Lucas asked questioningly.

Chu Shen shrugged. “Then we can’t do anything right away. I know you won’t accept that but hold on a second. First we make ourselves scarce and then start using the sniper drones to attack from a distance. That should give us some safety and also allow us to help out a lot.”

Lucas nodded. “Alright, it doesn’t seem like that bad of a plan. So when should we start?”

“How about now?” Chu Shen immediately started running down the hill. Lucas followed him. Both covered the distance between them and the wagons quickly. Soon they passed the wagon and had made it halfway to the fight.

Speaking of the fight, the dozen guards were already almost dead. Only two were still actively fighting with another three on the ground moaning. The other seven were already killed.

Chu Shen and Lucas started walking now, trying not to attract attention. After about two minutes all of he guards had died. However, they had not died in vain. For the dozen men had killed fifteen of the men on the enemy's side and the rest of them looked to have spent a pretty sizable portion of mana.

The 27 riders rode towards Lucas and Chu Shen, weapons drawn and still dripping with blood. An invisible cloud of nanites emerged from Lucas’ clothes and hovered in the middle of the path.

Chu Shen used his spiritual sense on them as they approached. All of them were at the Martial Warrior stage or Rank 5 warriors as this world called it. The men passed by Chu Shen and Lucas without stopping, though one shivered and glanced at them.

Unknown to them, they had already inhaled the nanites. Even their horses were doomed. Chu Shen, however, was startled. Why didn’t they ask about the spiritual scan? Of course, they may have seen Chu Shen and Lucas as pests so they wouldn’t be bothered by such things. 

But it still bothered him. Why wouldn’t they at least threaten them? Or scan them in return? Chu Shen had no answers and couldn’t even come up with a good excuse. He shook his head. It was still better this way.

They got a little bit down the road when Lucas looked over at him. “We can handle them. Go for it Lucas.”

Lucas immediately smiled. He held up three fingers and counted down. “3.2.1. Bang.” 


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 105 - Kill</h1>

“3.2.1. Bang.” 

Immediately the sound of a muffled explosion went off behind them. Of the 27 riders, 7 at the front immediately died, their bodies exploding from the inside out. Another 9 had their faces turn pale, coughing up blood and passing out. The rest seemed to immediately double over in pain but could still move.

As for why they did not all experience the same amount of damage, that part was simple. The ones in the front breathed in more nanites than the ones in the back. As a result, the explosion was a lot bigger for them. 

“Ugh! What the heck is going on!? Why did they suddenly explode!?” One of the men yelled panickedly. The horses were also not let off. Over half of the horses in the front died, simply because they did not have a very powerful cultivation level.

“It must have been them!” One of the bandits yelled pointing at Chu Shen and Lucas. “They’re the only ones here!” 

Chu Shen and Lucas immediately turned around to face them. “Hey! What are you going to do to those kids!?” Chu Shen yelled at them.

“Kill them of course! Run Xuan, we’ll hold them off while you kill those kids!” The bandits wheeled their horses around to face Chu Shen and Lucas. Of course, a couple were on the ground because their horses had died. All of them activated their body shield, or mana shield as it was called here.

Lucas frowned. “Chu Shen you’re the fastest. You go after that guy while I hold them off.”

“Fine.” Chu Shen took off after Xuan who was riding his horse towards the kids desperately trying to get away in the wagon. The bandits tried to stop him but Chu Shen dodged their attacks and continued on towards the fleeing bandit. 

“Don’t bother chasing him, he’s only a kid. Kill this guy first, he’s more dangerous!” The bandit leader yelled. Immediately the bandits let out a roar and charged towards Lucas.

Suddenly one of the men dissolved into a mist of blood from the waist up. Not even a second later there was a loud BOOM. The horses reared from sudden loud sound. Lucas grinned. The sniper drones sure did live up to his expectations.

“What is happening! Our mana shields have no effect! This is ba-!” The man spun backwards, half his body disappeared in a spray of blood.

BOOM. The sound of the railguns projectile bullet breaking the speed of sound came half a second later.

Lucas was hit several times by the bandits as they closed in on Lucas. The blades bounced off his metal skin, causing some sparks and nothing more. Lucas grinned as the warriors faces paled.

“HAHA! This is so much FUN! Let’s do this more often!” Lucas said as he lashed out at the group of 8 warriors surrounding him. His fist broke the sword of one of the warriors before hitting him in the chest. 

Like he had been hit with a cannonball, the warrior flew off through the air. His mana shield shattered with that one blow. The body shields of the bandits was different colors.

The one Lucas hit had a white colored shield. When he touched it, Lucas’ hand became covered in frost. He glanced at his hand. “Hmm. It seems like you guys do have some elemental powers. Might just make this interesting.”

……………………………………………….

“Get back here and face me!” Chu Shen yelled as he ran towards Xuan, utilizing Comet Travels Through to it’s max. His speed was almost impossible for someone of his cultivation level. He was slowly catching up to the horse.

“Ha! You must think I am a fool!” The bandit yelled over his shoulder. He kept riding full speed at the wagon full of kids.

“D*mn you!” Chu Shen kept running after him, slowly closing the distance. Suddenly a pistol appeared in his hand and fired a stream of fire towards the bandit.

“Crap!” The bandit jumped off his horse into the air. At the same time he drew a sword from his waist. He landed on the ground while Chu Shen stopped in front of him. Facing Chu Shen he held his sword out in front of him. “Fine, let’s fight.” A mana shield of a silver color appeared over him.

Chu Shen said nothing more as a black body shield appeared over him. He immediately took out his hammer and charged towards the bandit. The bandit similarly charged towards Chu Shen. Right as they were about to meet, the bandit swung at Chu Shen’s leg.

Chu Shen jumped over the man, doing a somersault in midair. As he did so, he used his movement to swing his hammer with deadly force. It struck the man’s back sending him flying forward, tumbling over the ground. However, electricity snaked up Chu Shen’s hammer.

The lightning seemed to cover his entire body, ravaging Chu Shen’s Qi. Chu Shen felt a slight numbness over his body as the lightning continued striking him. However, the lightning was slowly disappearing as Chu Shen absorbed the lightning with his null Qi. 

“Sheesh. This guy is dangerous.” Chu Shen said shaking his head as he absorbed the last of the lightning Qi. The man got up with a smirk on his face but he immediately paled upon seeing Chu Shen standing there without a scratch.

“What! Why aren’t you knocked out!? I clearly felt my lightning mana hit you!” The bandit said pointing at Chu Shen in shock.

Chu Shen shrugged. “Too bad it doesn’t work on me.” Null Qi was indeed too awesome, with it being able to nullify any type of Qi. However, the cultivation level was still a bit too much, causing him to take longer to nullify it.

“Alright then, take this!” The bandit yelled. He lifted his sword up in preparation of an overhand blow. The sword became covered in crackling lightning. The bandit swung his sword at Chu Shen even though they were over ten feet apart.

A blade made of lightning shot towards Chu Shen, so fast he couldn’t hope to dodge. Reinforcing his body shield, he gritted his teeth and swung his hammer to try and block the blow.

With a BANG Chu Shen was tossed backwards, flying through the air. As Chu Shen landed, the bandit continued running towards the kids, still attempting to kill them. The null Qi didn’t let any of the enemies mana hit his body but the explosion still knocked him backwards. His body became slightly numb from this strike as well.

Chu Shen recovered quickly though and ran after him. The man was slightly slower than the horse he had been on. Chu Shen quickly caught up to him and swung his hammer at the bandit. The bandit ducked, having heard Chu Shen running up behind him.

Chu Shen missed his swing but went with the hammer instead of slowing down. Following it’s circular motion, Chu Shen came completely around, smashing the bandits back as the bandit stood up just in time to receive his blow.

Before Chu Shen did not use null Qi so the bandit was able to block the majority of his blow. This time Chu Shen used his null Qi to cancel out Xuan’s mana shield. As a result, he was forced to take the blow with his body. 

SNAP “AHHH!!” The bandit Xuan screamed as the sound of bones breaking echoed outwards. The bandit landed on the ground a couple feet away. The bandit tried to stand up but his legs flopped around, not responding to his brains orders. Obviously his spine had snapped, causing him to be paralysed.

If it was before, than Chu Shen may not have had the strength to do such damage to a higher level cultivator. However, with Chu Shen’s increase in strength he could pose a threat to a cultivator who rashly let him hit their body. Not to mention that Chu Shen could drastically increase his hammer’s weight compared to before since he had a higher cultivation level.

Chu Shen put up his hammer and took out his railgun before walking up to the bandit. “If I hadn’t exhausted half my mana from that fight with the guards, I wouldn’t have died from just you!” The bandit spat out, along with some blood, as he glared at Chu Shen 

Chu Shen nodded before lifting the railgun, pointing it at the bandit’s head. He fired it with a BOOM, making the bandit’s head dissolve into a mist of blood. A hole with cracks spreading from it appeared below where the bandit’s head had previously been.

Chu Shen glanced over at Lucas. He still had three more people attacking him. Suddenly blades of ice appeared above the three people's heads and hit Lucas. Ice spread across Lucas’ body. The three men sighed. 

This guy was a monster. Their blades bounced off of him, fire and lightning didn’t work. He was so strong that not even using Mana he could break through their shields. Not to mention how their comrades would suddenly die after that loud sound. If they hadn’t exhausted themselves so much fighting the guards, they may have been able to finish it earlier.

“Hey Lucas, can you finish up? I’m already done here.” Chu Shen yelled at him. The three bandits looked at Chu Shen like he was stupid. Obviously his friend was an ice statue, did he actually expect a response?

“Fine.” Came the curt response from the frozen Lucas. Suddenly flames shot out of Lucas’ arms and legs. The ice melted quickly. Three BOOMS echoed out and the three bandits dissolved like snow in summer. Though a bit more gory than a snowflake.

Chu Shen and Lucas went over to the wagon of kids, a bit curious as to why  they were being chased. As soon as they came over, the wagon driver came out and kneeled in front of Chu Shen and Lucas.

“Thank you! Thank you! Without you, we would certainly be dead.” The wagons driver said with fervent intensity while kowtowing to Chu Shen. The kids were still crying and trembling from fright, too incoherent to speak.

“It’s fine. We loved to help out.” Lucas smiled at them.



<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 106 - Rising Tide Sect</h1>

“So, can you tell us who exactly was chasing you and why?” Lucas asked, looking a bit puzzled. Beside the wagon driver that had kowtowed to them, the wagon drivers of the other two wagons started kowtowing as well. The first wagon driver, who appeared to be their leader of sorts, got up.

The wagon driver opened his mouth to speak before closing it. He glanced at the kids behind him who were still shivering in fright. “Please respected master, could we take this conversation a little farther away? I don’t want to upset the kids.”


Lucas nodded while Chu Shen followed, wanting to listen in on the story behind the kids. The wagon driver stopped out of earshot of the kids and turned to face them.

“Alright, if you must know our story than it is pretty simple. We are from the Rising Tide Sect, a fairly well off sect in the White Lotus City. The White Lotus City has four leading sects. Ice Dragon Sect, Golden Palm Sect, and Asura Sect. The Asura Sect is a sect filled with only warriors that are filled with killing, studying assassin techniques.”


“We were stronger than the other sects but we kept to ourselves and wasn’t greedy. We gained two students, twins actually, that lead to our downfall unfortunately. They were taken to us to be tested, since we are the only sect that allows all to be tested for innate talent without checking their background and they were very poor..”

“One of the twins was tested as a possible Rank 7 Battle Mage, the other Rank 6 Battle Mage. We tried to keep it under wraps but it became known not even a month later. The other sects became worried, you must know that our sects combined had only ten Rank 6 adventurers with no Rank 7 adventurer appearing. And of those ten, four belonged to us.”

“The three sects knew that a Rank 7 Battle Mage would be enough to kill their highest adventurers even if they combined forces. However, none of them were strong enough on their own. The Asura Sect had three Rank 6 assassins and the other two sects each had their own Rank 6 mage.”

“They tried to take the kids from us but we refused them. After that they tried assassination but we managed to hold them off using our Rank 6 adventurers. However…….We never expected them to combine and wipe us out.”

“We received wind of the attack before it happened and immediately sent the kids away for their protection. After all, the entire point of this attack was to kill those two kids for their potential. However…” At this point the wagon driver had tears streaming down his face.

“That d*mned Asura Sect. They used their assassination stealth techniques to infiltrate the sect. As we rode out, we saw dozens of our sect members killed by the Asura Sect before our eyes. That is the reason the kids are in such a state, even if they didn’t come close to dying.”

“The other two sects had surrounded us and were killing or capturing any members that tried to leave the Rising Tide Sect. My own brother was among those killed. We wouldn’t have made it out if there hadn’t been for the elders sacrificing themselves to clear a path through.”

“However, even as we left we were pursued by those Rank 5 warriors you saw. Some of the elders did not participate in the killing so that they could protect us from further damage. Who would have thought we would only make it ten miles before they were killed by our pursuers.”

Chu Shen and Lucas exchanged looks. This matter was not as simple as the wagon driver said. Simply put, three organizations were hunting for them and wanted to kill them. All because of some superior talent. While they digested this news, the wagon driver gradually regained his composure.

Chu Shen spoke to the wagon driver. “If we can, we wish to keep these kids safe.” He turned to Lucas. “Lucas, what can we do? We can’t leave them otherwise they may just be killed.”

Lucas immediately became surprised. “Me!? I’m the one that asks you these kinds of things. There’s eighty one kids here on the three wagons back there and I have no idea what to do with them.” 

“Fine. Let me try and think of something.” Chu Shen adopted a thoughtful look and closed his eyes. Several ideas flitted through his head. Eventually though he opened his eyes.

He looked at the wagon driver. “Did you have a destination when you set off with those kids?”

The wagon driver shook his head. “Unfortunately no, we did not have a true destination. We were merely hoping to outrun the those warriors by traveling on the road.”

Chu Shen nodded. “Alright, can you tell me how safe the surrounding forest is?”

The wagon driver shook his head. “If you are thinking of hiding them here, you can’t. It is too close to the city, they would find you quickly.”

“Alright.” Chu Shen nodded. “Well then, there is only a few options and most aren’t safe. The best I can come up with is this. Take the kids as fast as possible as far as possible. Me and Lucas will scout farther back down the path and warn you when they are closing in on you.”

“Then the kids will leave the wagons and head into the forest. You and the other wagon driver will then keep going onwards to mislead them while we hide in the forest and cover our tracks. When you get by a town after the kids leave, abandon the wagons and hide until the pursuers are gone. Then come back for us.”

The wagon driver had a thoughtful look on his face while Chu Shen described his strategy. Finally he smiled at Chu Shen. “Well, I believe this is the best plan. Along with us three wagon riders there are two teachers, though they are only Rank 4 so they aren’t much help. They can help with the kids while we mislead them.”

Lucas smiled. “Well let us complete this plan then.” Chu Shen left to go look at the kids for while. There was some things he needed to check. Lucas went with the main wagon rider to help him with getting ready for the future tasks. The teachers he had mentioned were busy comforting the kids.

All of the kids were at most 9 and at least 6. Extremely young compared to Chu Shen’s age of 13 and Lucas’ age of 15. While Lucas was surveying the kids the main wagon driver came up to him and looked at the kids with him.

After a bit he sighed. “These are the greatest talents of my Rising Tide Sect. Unfortunately they are immature and pale in front of your young master. How fortunate it is to be a servant of someone like him.”

Lucas gave the wagon driver a sideways look. “What do you mean?”


The wagon driver looked back at him. “What? Aren’t you guys a master servant duo out to travel and experience the world? Most young masters of clans and sects are sent out to mature and have someone powerful guard them. I figured you must be one of them, maybe even one of those super sects?”

Lucas stared at him for a second before suddenly bursting out in laughter. The wagon driver watched him helplessly until Lucas managed to recover. He wiped a tear from his eye as he straightened up. Truly his body was a work of art, even able to mimic a tear.

“Hehe. Sorry about that. No we aren’t any young master servant duo. We are friends out traveling and exploring.” Lucas frowned as he saw the wagon driver look at Lucas’ tall muscular body before giving Lucas an incredulous look. “HEY! Just because I look old doesn’t mean I am! I’m fifteen! Puberty hit me harder that's all!”




















<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 107 - The Last Piece</h1>

Chu Shen just walked past the wagons, looking at the kids. Most of them had tear stained faces with snot running down their faces. A couple of them were curled up into a ball.

Chu Shen shook his head. He understood exactly why they were so traumatized now. Such a tragic past, watching those you cared for die one after another. He was sure that he himself would be in such a state. To a normal kid, watching even a stranger die like that would be tragic. 

Of course, Chu Shen had lived by the edge of the woodlands. Often the town would be attacked by Primordial Beasts and the townsmen would fight back. Unfortunately, Chu Shen had seen quite a few disciples die at the claws of the beasts.

As a result, Chu Shen had already seen just how brutal the world could be. This was the reason he had not hesitated to kill before, because he had already experienced death. Though it was a bit different killing a person than a beast, it made it easier that those people were brutal killers and deserved to die.

While Chu Shen was walking around at the kids, a pair of them stood out from the rest. The reason why was that these two were teenagers, around fourteen, but the others were around eight or nine with a few being younger. They seemed to be having a much harder time and most of the kids around them kept as much room as possible between them and the two teenagers.

Maybe Chu Shen would have gone up to talk to them, but they wagons were about to move out. He walked up towards one of the wagons. Suddenly he felt his hair stand on end and his arm grew ice cold. Startled, his hammer appeared in his hand while Chu Shen took up a defensive posture.

‘Calm down brat. It’s just me.’

Chu Shen relaxed and put away his hammer. The kids around him became frightened when he drew his hammer. It wasn’t too surprising since they had watched him kill someone with it not even half an hour ago. Trying to appease them, he smiled at them and walked a little farther away.

‘What did you do Master? Why did I feel that sensation in my arm?”

‘Well brat, its simple. I used the Voids Hand to channel my soul. Then I used my soul to scan those kids. Something didn’t sit right with me. Everyone having an element already, pre-opened meridians, or them not unblocking any meridians. All of it puzzled me.’

‘What did you find out master?’ Chu Shen immediately inquired excitedly. 

‘Hmmph.’ Chu Shen could practically see Master Ti Wu grinning smugly at him. ‘Wouldn’t you like to know.’

‘Please master, please!’

‘Fine. Just remember to perfect that martial art you picked up from the library, okay brat! Otherwise you won’t get a single word from me.’

‘Alright master. Just tell me what you found out.’

‘All artificers are curious and I guess you are no exception. Anyways, I scanned their souls to find out what exactly made them so different than those other martial artists I have encountered. What I found is pretty shocking. They have mutated souls.’

‘Mutated souls is exactly what it sounds like. A soul that is abnormal. An innate constitution is just like that, but in a positive mutation. A negative mutation would be not being able to absorb any Qi. As for these people….. I can say they are blessed but their curses far outweigh their blessings.’

‘What is the mutation exactly?’ Chu Shen asked.

‘As people cultivate, their souls slowly refine themselves to become a pure representation of someone. Thus, they will gain an element. However, animals and those with innate constitutions are already in tune with their element and are therefore born with one already.’

‘These people have a great affinity with the natural elements. As a result they are born with their own element and can mix it with the world’s elements, thus creating mages. However, they do not have Soul Sense. They cannot use their soul to sense things including their own meridians. ‘

‘Okay, what does that mean exactly?’ Chu Shen asked 

‘The reason those men did not react when you scanned them with your soul sense was because they could not detect you. They don’t unblock their meridians because they cannot see their own meridians! They can sense things to some extent, which is why they can still feel the major meridians and call it mana rivers.’

‘If I had to associate it with something, it would be like having nearsighted vision and looking at a piece of paper with large and small print. Obviously you can see the paper and if your vision isn’t too bad you can perceive the large print. But obviously seeing small print could be considered impossible.’

‘In this case, the paper is the worlds energy. The large print is the opened mana channels and the small print is the closed meridians. For warriors though… It is a bit different. They can barely perceive the medium size print and widen it using more ink. The medium print is obviously the opened minor meridians and the ink is of course their mana.’

With this new information, Chu Shen sunk into deep thought. According to what he had seen so far, this made perfect sense. Obviously, if there was a way to grow stronger, especially something so obvious, someone would have found it by now.

The only explanation would be that it was an impossibility. Just like how the people from Lucas’ dimension didn’t cultivate at all because of this impossibility.

‘But wait master. I learned martial arts is used by channeling Qi through the meridians. So how come these people still use martial arts?’

‘That? Martial Arts? Oh please. They only know how to cover their sword in Qi and lash it out at you. If that was a true martial art being used, especially with such powerful Qi, you would have been injured even with your null Qi. That could only be called crude usage of power, a parlor trick compared to a real martial art.’ 

‘Also, those mages only have powerful attacks because it is supplemented with world Qi. In raw power, their spells can compare to a martial art. However, they can’t control them as well, plus it takes time to charge. It is true a powerful martial art can take time to charge, but it is half that of those spells of equal power.’

‘Hehe. Brat you might just be lucky though. By using your own soul sense and manipulating your Qi, you can guide these younglings mana into their own meridians. With that, they should be able to cultivate like we normally do. I would say, gathering an army from these people would be easy. Plus, by changing awful talents to limitless ones, they should be grateful enough to never betray us.’

Chu Shen shook his head at the thought. ‘No. I don’t want that kind of responsibility. All I want is to become strong enough to protect my mom and dad when I go back to my realm.’

‘Either way, I say you should let these kids cultivate. Use them to found the Void Sect again in this strange world.’

‘I did promise to let the Void Sect rise again. I guess letting them cultivate here would be the start. I can always visit them later using the bracelets.’

‘I like the way you think. And after we can trust them, I think I could change one of their souls to have soul sense. It’ll take some effort but it may be possible. I will have to study their souls extensively to do it. It should take a year to get all the data I need. Then I should be able to change it right away, or make a technique that allows them to gain soul sense themselves.’

‘Are you sure this is a good idea master? Letting them gain techniques from us like this?’

‘What are you worried about? This is common knowledge, though I admit it would change their life a lot. Just like sharing how to make fire. It’s so simple, but can bring a lot of changes to those who didn’t know how to before. Besides, we can use the Voids Hand to bind their souls to agree not to share information on the cultivation techniques without them dying.’

‘Alright master. I guess you do know more then me after all.’

‘Of course, that's why I’m the master. Wait. Do you mean you actually doubted me for a second.’

‘Uhh. Master, of course not. I, i, i just…. Goodbye master!’ Chu Shen promptly started running back to the wagons.

‘Goodbye?! I’m attached to your hand! I’m not going anywhere. Come Here!’

‘Stop it master! STOP IT!’

‘Suffer for doubting your master, you unfilial disciple!’

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 108 - Pursuit</h1>

Chu Shen was walking down the road, looking around at the forest and admiring the view. Somewhere ahead of him was Lucas along with the wagons pulling the kids. So far it had already been four days and they were easily miles ahead of him by now. 

Especially since they were not planning on stopping to rest at all. Lucas would hunt down beasts and cook them ahead of the wagon so that the kids could eat and not starve.

Inside his pocket was a small coin sized broadcaster that would allow Chu Shen to contact Lucas. With it, he would be able to tell them when the Asura, Ice Dragon, and Golden Palm sects adventurers would come to him.

Chu Shen took his time relaxing and pondering while he was walking. What he was thinking of was what he was going to do in this world. So far, Chu Shen had never had a true plan when he went into different dimensions. Most of the time he was just doing whatever he wanted while trying to get stronger.

The biggest plan he ever had was to get money or get out of trouble like he had with the Black Rose Guild. This time though, he needed a plan. These kids were depending upon him.

He couldn’t accept their word for it, but at the very least they had no reason to lie to him. If the Asura sect was as bloodthirsty as they said, it was not going to end well. Going up against assassins was never a good idea.

Chu Shen could not accept the fact that these kids would die. At this point though, the grudge they had could not end unless one side died or the other. So long as the Asura, Ice Dragon, and Golden Palm Sect, especially the Asura Sect, was around then they would not let these kids survive in peace.

So what could Chu Shen do then? With the cultivation techniques he had and the radical method of unblocking meridians, these kids could become strong very quickly. With that, Chu Shen would easily let them take revenge against those dastardly sects that would kill even kids.

However, what would he do then? How long would it take to do that anyways? Two, three years? As far as he could tell, the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion would go to different dimensions randomly. He couldn’t depend upon being around to help them.

So he had to make the kids self-reliant. Otherwise, they would be left vulnerable and possibly in a worse position than when he had tried to help. Of course he had to do so while not completely destroying the balance of the world.

Technology, once it was shared, could not be taken back. However, since the cultivation techniques Chu Shen had were useless unless he used his own Qi, the power balance would only be affected temporarily. It wouldn’t make widespread changes.

So, what was his plan for this dimension, for these kids? Chu Shen didn’t know yet. What he did know was that he had to help them somehow. The best way he could help was by protecting them and making them stronger using cultivation techniques. Everything else would have to be planned out with some consulting with the teachers and wagon drivers.

However, he would have to act like he would disappear into thin air the next minute. Especially because he just might. 

Chu Shen looked away from the side of the road. He heard something coming. Glancing back, he saw men in black clothes riding horses. Chu Shen observed them as they slowly caught up with him.

They had masks on their faces that had horns and demonic faces. Black robes cloaked their bodies with a hood covering the rest of their faces. A badge of a red man with the same demonic face as the one on their masks was on the chest of each one but some had different amount of arms on the badge. 

The man in the front had a badge with six arms wielding six swords coming out of its sides. The three behind him had five arms wielding swords with two emerging from each of the red man's sides and the fifth arm coming from behind the man like a scorpion's tale.

The other nine men behind them had badges with four arms. All of them exuded a sense of unparalleled killing intent. Chu Shen felt all of the hair on his arms stand on edge as he felt his body turn cold. Clearly these people were dangerous, a cut above all of his other enemies.

Chu Shen waited until they passed before using his soul sense to scan them. As he did, Master Ti Wu, who usually sat down inside the Voids Hand, stood up. “Seems like my disciple might need my help this time.” He said, stroking his chin as he stared upwards, seemingly to see out of the library and into the world.

Meanwhile, Chu Shen used his soul sense on the enemy. The enemy had one rank six adventurer, three rank five adventurer, and nine rank four adventurers. Immediately Chu Shen made the connection with the badge of the red man and the amount of arms each one had.

However, as the soul sense was completed, the man at the front with the six arm badge turned around and stared right at Chu Shen. A red light flashed in the eye sockets of the man. A searing heat lanced towards Chu Shen, catching him right in the chest and sent him flying backwards. His clothes caught on fire and his skin started burning as he tumbled on the ground

Luckily, his skin was remarkably tough from the constant tempering from the Void King technique. Otherwise the heat may have penetrated into his inner organs causing him to become severely injured. Instead, his skin only became mildly burned. Chu Shen quickly activated his body shield, allowing his null Qi to extinguish the heat.

The red light in the eyes of the man disappeared. A rough, hoarse voice came out from beneath the mask. “Lowly characters like you should stay out our business. If you try and use that technique again, I will not be so kind as to use a mere <Stare of The Asura>.”

Chu Shen stayed on the ground and merely observed as they continued riding past him. Master Ti Wu sat back down inside the Voids Hand. “Humph. Seems like he got lucky.”

 One of the men with a five arm badge rode up next to the six arm badge. “Forgive me Vajra Asura, what do you mean when you said he used a technique against us? I felt nothing.”

The man he called Vajra Asura shook his head. “As an Agni Asura I expect better. Did you not feel as though someone was staring at you just a moment ago?”

The Agni Asura expressed some confusion. “Yes, but what of it? I thought it was merely that kid being curious.”

The Vajra Asura shook his head. Three Agni Asura and nine Dhara Asura and yet none of them were sensitive enough to mana. This was one of the reasons why they could not advance to another rank even if warriors supposedly could advance for ever.

“The mana fluctuated abnormally at the same time as I felt that stare. It must have been a technique of some kind. I do not know it’s purpose but it must not be good. Pay more attention to the surrounding mana otherwise the assassin may be the one ambushed.” The Vajra Asura said in an offhand voice.

The Agni Asura bowed at him. “Thank you for advice Vajra Asura. It is rare to meet one of the three backbones of the Asura Sect. However, why did you not kill him?”

The Vajra Asura shook his head. “The <Stare of The Asura>  was a test. If he had not been injured at all then he may have posed a threat to us. With the damage done to him he would be the equivalent of an Dhara Asura. With me here, he would not pose a threat to us. Why kill an ant if we do not need to?”

“Your words ring true as always.” The Agni Asura said. The Vajra Asura ignored the obvious flatter and continued riding on.

The Agni Asura fell back into formation with the other two Agni Asura. The Asura continued on their way. Chu Shen was able to hear them since they were still in earshot. It turns out they were from the Asura Sect.

Chu Shen shook his head. Stare of The Asura. A technique that used mana and fired it from the eyes. If he had his body shield up, he would have been able to block it fairly easy. Unfortunately he gave no warning before launching the attack. 

Luckily it was a light blow combined with his strong body. Otherwise taking a Rank 6 warriors attack without armor, the equivalent of a Martial Army Cultivator, would have resulted in death or severe injury at best.

Chu Shen reached into his pocket. Taking out the broadcaster he activated it. “Lucas. They’re coming.”


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 109 - Robed Man</h1>

“Lucas they’re coming.” Chu Shen’s voice was received by Lucas cybernetic brain. He did not hear it vocally yet it sounded inside his head as clear as day. If it had to be related to something, the closes it would come would be telepathy. It was a unique ability of cyborgs, to send information straight to the digital cerebral cortex, allowing them to hear transmissions of sound without it physically being heard.

Lucas stiffened slightly in response to Chu Shen’s transmission. “How many and how strong?” Lucas said, his lips not moving despite him talking to Chu Shen with his internal radio.

“There is a Rank 6 assassin, three Rank 5 assassins, and nine Rank 4 assassins.” Chu Shen’s voice rang inside Lucas’ head.

“Alright. Should we continue with the plan of taking the kids off the road while the drivers continue on.”

“NO! These assassins are good. The Rank 6 assassin detected my soul scan even when they can’t use their own souls for detection. He was sensitive enough to Qi to detect the subtle changes from the soul scan. He’s too good to be fooled by something so amateur as that.”

Lucas frowned. This wasn’t good. They may not be able to shake these guys off after all. “So, what do you suggest?” 

“I have a plan…”

……………………………………………………………………………………....

It had been five days since they had killed the men of the Ice Dragon and Golden Palm. One day since Chu Shen had encountered the Asura sect’s assassins. 

They assassins were quickly catching up to the kids. Previously they had been separated by over twenty miles, twenty three if they followed the path. The kids rode wagons to try and keep as much distance between them and the assassins as possible.

Unfortunately, even with all their effort it was in vain. The assassins had top of the line horses, unlike the Rising Tide who had grabbed common horses from the stables. Not to mention the fact the assassin’s horses were unburdened with a large wagon.

The assassins had quickly gained on them in only a single day. Now, they were only seven miles away. The next day, the assassins would be on top of them. Lucas had kept track of them using the holo-drone-which was why they know how far away they were-and kept Chu Shen informed the entire time.

They had discussed how to deal with the assassins and finally came up with a final plan. Now it was time to put the plan into action.

The Asura Sect assassins rode on the horses. Their bodies rocked with the horses in a calm, unhurried manner. Obviously they were very experienced with horse riding. 

Suddenly, the Vajra Asura reined his horse in. The other Asura Sect members did the same. All of them drew their weapons simultaneously and mana shields flared to life. All of their body shields were black but one of the Dhara had traces of green and one of the Agni Asura had traces of silver. Three of the Dhara Asura jumped off their horses, fading into the shadows of the forest that surrounded the rough earthen path.

The cause for their alarm was a man in a black robe, that covered his entire body and face, that had appeared in front of them. None of them had realized he was there beforehand. The Vajra Asura saw the man suddenly appear in front of them.

Normally Mana would be slightly disturbed by cloaking abilities such as the <Cloak of Asura> that the three Dhara had utilized. However, when this man appeared, the mana only fluctuated slightly at the exact moment he appeared. Unlike the continuous fluctuation of a skill when it was active. This mean the man had purposefully revealed himself through the fluctuations and his appearance. Otherwise, they would have never known that he was watching them.

 The Vajra Asura stepped off of his horse, the mana shield of his activated as he approached the robed man. The Vajra Asura’s mana shield was a bright orange with bits of black swirling around inside.

He cupped his hands and bowed to the robed man. “Junior Gu Lan, Vajra Asura Level Member of the Asura Sect from White Lotus City greets senior. May I ask why you have appeared here?”

The robed man said nothing for a few seconds before he suddenly spoke. The voice was that of a middle age man.“You pursue a group of kids.” It as a statement. Like he knew exactly what they were here for.

Gu Lan was shocked, but his mask kept the robed man from seeing it. “Yes I am pursuing the remnants of the Rising Tide Sect. They have been at odds with the Asura Sect and we are here to make sure all roots are exterminated.”

The robed man kept his head bowed. “Go back. Do not continue looking for them.” His authoritative tone caused the other Asura Sect members to bristle in anger.


Gu Lan was puzzled. Exactly who was this man who ordered the Asura Sect around so casually. “May I ask senior, exactly what does this matter have to do with you.”

“I have accepted those two siblings as my pupils. I am sure you know exactly which ones I refer to. In order to get them to accept me as their master, I have to protect their fellow students.”

Gu Lan shuddered. This wasn’t good. Who knew how powerful this man was? Even with his finely tuned senses as an assassin and Rank 6 warrior, he couldn’t detect this man before he wanted to reveal himself.

At the same time, he couldn’t allow this man to block their way. Otherwise, that Rank 7 battle mage would come back for revenge. Remembering the things the Asura sect had done to them. 

Gu Lan cupped his hands “I am sorry senior. But I must exterminate future problems for our sect.”

As he cupped his hands, the three Dhara Asura emerged from beside the man. All of them swung their swords at the same time, releasing huge amounts of black energy that formed a blade that hit the robed man!


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 110 - Mental Projection</h1>

The black blade formed from the energy of three Dhara Asura struck the robed man! The Vajra Asura smiled underneath his mask. It seems as though the robed man was not as powerful as he thought. Suddenly his face froze. ‘No. No! NO! IT CAN’T BE!’

The black blade hit the robed man in the chest. However, strangely enough, the energy blade passed through his chest and continued on, slicing through the forest like a hot knife through butter. The blade cut through close to a hundred trees before it dissipated from lack of mana.

Gu Lan did not look so good. His face was pale underneath his mask, sweat dripping down his neck. The robed man glanced up. When he did, the Vajra Asura recoiled. “I warned you.” came the chilling voice of the black robed man.

The robed man flicked his wrist. Immediately three booms rang out and the three Dhara Asura that attacked him dissolved into mists of blood. A hole appeared in the ground below where their bodies stood. Rock shards flew through the air, bouncing off of the Asura members mana shields.

Gu Lan stumbled backwards. The might of that attack stunned him. It was just slightly over the power needed to overwhelm their mana shields and kill them instantly. Any less and they would have only been injured severely.

Of course, they were only Rank 4 warriors. But even he would require some effort to kill a Rank 4 warrior with their mana shield activated. The casual attack Gu Lan had used on that Rank 4 Warrior from earlier had injured the warrior. But that was under the condition of the warrior not activating his body shield. Otherwise, the attack would have only done glancing damage.


From this, Gu Lan was able to come to a frightening conclusion. Such a basic attack like <Metal Strike> containing such tyrannical might proved that this man was a high rank metal mage! Adding in the fact that their attacks passed right through him proved one thing. ‘He’s a mental projection! This isn’t good at all!’

<Mental Projection>. The ability to make a copy of oneself using pure mana and a portion of the user's soul. Such a projection is intangible but the copy can still use the abilities of the original, though the abilities will be weakened. It is an ability that is kept by major clans or sects and can only be learned by extremely talented people.

Only mages could make copies of themselves. It required immense control and major amounts of Qi to accomplish along with the ability to split a part of their soul and embed it inside the copy. It would at most look like an illusionary ghost at the early stages. To make a completely realistic copy like the one in front of Gu Lan required a Rank 8 mage, maybe even a Rank 9 battle mage.

His Asura sect only had three Rank 6 Warrior. Such a high Rank mage was someone they could not hope to fight against. Gu Lan would be almost instantly be killed. He couldn’t even hope to contend against such a person.

“B*STARD! TO KILL TAI MIN LIKE THAT!” One of the Agni Asura screamed at the robed man. The Agni Asura’s name was Tai Ju, the brother of Tai Min. As a result he immediately became outraged at his brother being killed. His body shield surged, causing the silver streaks to flicker brightly and the shadow to become darker.

He pointed his sword at the black robed man and a dark beam of energy a meter in diameter shot towards the man. Streaks of lightning was hidden inside the black beam, proving its hidden might. 

While the black beam shot towards the robed man, a figure covered in black energy with swirls of orange darted in front of the pillar of energy. A similar beam of black energy with flames hidden inside shot towards the pillar. 

However, the beam containing flames was obviously stronger. It blew the original beam back and struck Tai Ju in the chest and exploded, sending him flying backwards. His body shield cracked as he struck a tree, causing him to spit out a mouthful of blood. 

The Vajra Asura Gu Lan stood in front of the robed man with his hands up from firing the <Hidden Pillar of Asura> back at Tai Ju. He turned towards the other Dhara and Agni Asura. “Get down and kowtow to apologize to this Senior.” Rang out Gu Lan’s cold voice.

He turned back to the robed man and did not bow at the waist like he had before. Instead he kowtowed on the ground. A rushed inhalation of breath was all the signs of shock the other Asura gave. They glanced at each other before dismounting their horses and following suit.

Gu Lan kowtowed three times before daring to talk to the robed man. “I am sorry great senior to have attacked you. I had eyes but did not see Mount Tai. Those kids, if they are under your protection, shall not be touched by Asura Sect. Please spare us.”

The robed man nodded. “I shall spare you. Leave and do not touch my disciples or their friends again.”

Gu Lan kowtowed one more time. “This Junior understands Senior.” He quickly got up before mounting his horse. Tai Ju had stumbled to his feet by now, still dizzy from the attack Gu Lan had struck him with.

Gu Lan passed by Tai Ju. “Fool!” He hissed through closed teeth. “Do not lose control and disrespect the Asura. Assassins are cut off from all feelings. Next time, I shall not save you from your own idiocy.”

The Vajra Asura then quickly rode away on his horse. The other Asura had stopped kowtowing after the Vajra Asura had and quickly mounted their own horses. Tai Ju stared hatefully at the robed man but suddenly he became frightened. The robed man had disappeared right before his eyes.

Spooked, Tai Ju mounted his own horse quickly and rode off after the other Asura. Meanwhile, Lucas was laughing his head off. Wiping away a nonexistent tear from his eye, he activated his comm system. “He he. Chu Shen it worked. They’re gone.”


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 111 - The Plan</h1>

“He he. Chu Shen it worked. They’re gone.” Lucas voice came out of the transmitter on the ground in front of him. Chu Shen had stopped where the Vajra Asura Gu Lan had attacked him with the <Stare of The Asura>. 

He had spent some time recuperating from his injury as it was too painful for him to walk very far with the burns on his chest. Plus, the entire plan they had come up with was based on subterfuge. So he wouldn’t have been much help anyways.

Chu Shen sighed in relief. “Good. I wasn’t sure if the plan would work or not, thankfully it did.”

The plan Chu Shen and Lucas had come up with was pretty simple. Pretend to be an expert and bluff their way to getting the Asura Sect to stop pursuing the kids. Of course, such a plan required great discipline.

The basis of this plan came from when they were reading in the library about mages and Chu Shen remembered a passage he read about mages having mental projections. There were even mages that specialized in creating illusions from mana and were called illusion mages by the public.

Chu Shen had Lucas ask the teachers from the caravan about it and gained some specific information that allowed them to carry out the plan. First off, the mental projection was not tangible but could still use techniques. Secondly, the mental projection could be done at a distance. Finally, the more detailed the projection, the stronger the caster.

With this, Chu Shen immediately realized that such requirements was perfect for them. With the holo-drone being able to create holograms, they fit the first criteria of being intangible. With the completely realistic image the holo-drone could create of  a person, they would be perceived as a very high rank mage. 

Using the sniper drones, they could pass as a metal mage. A metal mage was a mage with the innate element of metal. Their attacks were sharp and piercing, completely matching the description of a railgun attack. With that, the image of a high ranking mage was complete.

Of course, for normal people there would be one other problem. Nervousness. The assassins were experts at reading people's body language and telling what they were feeling at the moment. If they showed any hesitation or nervousness at all, the game would be up.

However, Lucas was a cyborg. And the hologram was not a real person. Using his cybernetic brain and programming skills, creating a 3-D image of a black robed mage wasn’t tough. Manipulating the mage’s body from a distance was also not so tough.

Lucas’ cybernetic brain processed data at just slightly below the speed of electricity. With this, Lucas was able to manipulate the image perfectly, completely fooling those assassins.

Chu Shen let out a deep breath. Thankfully it worked. If they had discovered the holo-drone or the sniper drones, everything would have been over. Of course, they could have still tried to escape into the forest. However, it only had a 10% chance of success.

Chu Shen knew that in raw power they were not as powerful as the Vajra Asura. However, if they continuously used the sniper drone to attack them, then they could have killed most of the Asura with repeated attacks. Even the Vajra Asura would suffer if he was hit with twenty rounds from the railgun in ten seconds.

However, if they did then some might have escaped letting the Asura Sect know what they were up against. After all, there was only three sniper guns and twelve people. And some needed multiple shots to kill.


“So Chu Shen, what do we do now? That should have stopped those sects from pursuing us.”

Chu Shen shook his head but stopped halfway as he realized Lucas couldn’t see him doing so. “We’re not safe, not by a long shot. We may have thrown the Asura Sect off the trail but the other sects may still continue hunting us. They may believe this is an attempt by the Asura Sect to monopolize that Rank 7 Battle Mage and Rank 6 Mage.”


“If we encounter another one of those sects, we may not be as lucky as we were now. Mages are more sensitive to Qi in the air and may be able to detect the holo drone or sniper drones. It wouldn’t end well for us if that happened.” 

“Go ahead and get at least another hundred miles and then lead them to the closest Magical Beast forest. Stay on the outskirts of it and set up a small camp. We can train them there.”

Lucas waited to see if Chu Shen was done. Upon realizing he was, his voice came out clearly from the comm. “Alright, will do Chu Shen. Stay safe.”

“See you later buddy.”

“You too.”

Chu Shen continued circulating his Qi to his chest, speeding up the healing process by over tenfold. Already his skin had gone from the charred skin from earlier to having a thick scab. 

The heat from the <Stare of The Asura> had cause third-degree burns, causing minor damage to his chest muscles. To a regular human, such a burn would be life threatening and would require months to heal. To a martial artist at the same level as Chu Shen, such a burn would be considered a serious injury.

It would take them at least a week to recover to fitness. Thanks to the <Void King> technique, his body was not only extremely tough but also changed to heal faster. 

A normal martial artist’s body would accept energy to heal their body. However, their body could only accept so much energy to heal without it being detrimental to their health. The amount they could absorb and use to heal the body at once paled in comparison to Chu Shen who had tempered his body with an enormous amount of void Qi.

As a result, his body was able to heal several times faster than normal but it also required several times more energy than normal. Chu Shen stayed there healing. The next day his scar had turned into new, silver skin where the burn had been before.

Chu Shen was almost finished healing when he heard horses galloping. Glancing up from where he sat in the Lotus position, he saw the previously arrogant Asura riding towards him. Three of the Dhara Asura were gone. Now only six Dhara Asura, three Agni Asura, and the one Vajra Asura was left.

He grinned as they passed by. Watching the fruits of his labor was certainly nice. 

…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..

Tai Ju was incensed. His anger at his brother being killed before his eyes and yet denied revenge was barely contained. Even after he knew the killer was far above him in power, he still wanted revenge.

Tai Ju and Tai Min had joined the Asura Sect as orphans, their parents killed by bandits. The requirements for joining the Asura Sect was strict and one of the requirements was having a darkness attribute and be a warrior. Tai Ju had a minor lightning and Major darkness attribute, making him a rarity and a potentially powerful assassin.

With the increased speed and explosive power of lightning and the cloaking power of darkness, he was considered a favorite for becoming a powerful assassin. He had been called talented since he was young and used his influence to keep his brother close by his side.

A tear trickled down his face, hidden behind the demonic mask. Now he couldn’t defend his brother. His fist clenched. He decided to depart from the Asura Sect upon his return and hunt down the mage that killed his brother.

As he was consumed with grief and rage, he glanced at the side of road seeing Chu Shen grinning at them with the hole still burned through his clothes.

Tai Ju immediately focused on that grin. That mocking grin, happy at the fact that the arrogant Asura were missing. That some of them were dead. That HIS brother DIED! 

He snapped.



<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 112 - A brothers Agony</h1>

Tai Ju swung his left foot over the horse's saddle and jumped off the horse using it’s side like a springboard. He shot towards Chu Shen, drawing his sword in one fluid movement.

“SMILING LIKE THAT AT TAI MIN’S DEATH! YOU DESERVE TO DIE!” Tai Ju’s sword light up with silver light, becoming covered in lightning. He swung his sword at Chu Shen’s neck, aiming to behead him with one blow. 

Chu Shen immediately became shocked at the sudden attack. Just what was this guy’s problem to attack someone like this? Utilizing The Stars Dance, Chu Shen avoided the blow, appearing ten feet away from the crazed Agni Asura. His body shield flickered into being, becoming a black shield around his body.

Gu Lan glanced over at the surprising scene. He sighed. Of course he understood that even the most cold hearted assassin would feel something after their brother died before his eyes. Of course, a true assassin would still put probabilities of success above their own emotions.

If Tai Ju needed to take his frustrations out on a Rank 4 warrior, that was understandable. However, it was indeed a bit embarrassing for an Asura Sect member to attack a Rank 4 warrior. 

Gu Lan frowned. Make that a Rank 3 warrior. Surprisingly that Rank 3 warrior was already healed from his attack, and his body was also abnormally strong, making him think that kid was a Rank 4 warrior. How odd. Anyways, it wouldn’t matter when he was dead.

He turned a blind eye to the attack and rode even faster down the road. The other Asura glanced at each other but followed the Vajra Asura back towards the sect. Tai Ju’s horse stayed where it had fallen on the side of the road, from the force of Tai Ju’s kick.

Chu Shen faced Tai Ju. He held up his hands. “Whoa! I didn’t do anything to you so why are you attacking me? I mean, is this how the Asura Sect does things now?”

Tai Ju turned towards Chu Shen from where he had landed after attacking Chu Shen. “You smiled.” Came the bone chillingly cold voice from behind the demonic mask.

Chu Shen’s face became puzzled. “Huh? What does me smiling have to do with anything?”

“IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH IT!” Tai Ju screamed as he seemed to turn into a bolt of lightning. He shot forth at a speed that was near incomprehensible. Chu Shen reacted just as fast though. A circular shield made up of gray energy appeared before Chu Shen. Obviously this was the Universe Shield!

Tai Ju slammed into the shield, making it crack but it didn’t break. He stumbled backwards, blood coming from his forehead from the impact. His body shield finally flared to life. “YOU HAVE NO RIGHT! NONE!” Tai Ju screamed as he swung his sword at the shield in front of him.

The shield dimmed for a second after being struck by that sword. Then it became even brighter, the cracks from earlier repairing themselves. “MY BROTHER JUST DIED! YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SMILE!”

Tai Ju seemed oblivious to the fact that with every swing of his blade, the lightning on it dimmed and his enemy grew stronger. After the fourteenth blow, the lightning seemed to have disappeared entirely. Unconcerned, he continued bashing his sword against the circular shield with no mana infused into it at all. Ironically, this made the shield start to weaken even though the blows themselves were weaker. “YOU HAVE NO RIGHT! NO RIGHT TO MOCK HIM! NO RIGHT TO BE HAPPY!”

Tears trickled down past the Agni Asura’s mask and into the folds of his clothes. His vision became blurry but he continued lashing out at the object keeping him from the one who disrespected his brother’s memory. Suddenly, the Universe Shield broke, shattering into pieces before fading into motes of gray light.

Chu Shen had taken off while Tai Ju had been smashing at the Universe Shield like a wild animal. Of course he wasn’t going to fight him! That was a Rank 5 warrior, the equivalent of a Martial Warrior. He himself was a peak Rank 3 battle mage, the equivalent of a Level 9 Martial Practitioner. 

That was a difference of two ranks or two stages! Of course, Chu Shen had taken on a Rank 5 warrior before and won. If he fought now and used all of his techniques, revealing his null Qi, than he could of course win and fairly easily at that since he was consumed with grief and rage.

He had many trump cards on his person. His body’s strength was on par with a Peak Rank 4 warrior. His null Qi allowed them to fight on even grounds when it came to mana/Qi. All of these were trump cards to use in life or death situations.

However, so what if he did kill the rank 5 warrior? There was still two more Rank 5 warriors just down the road that were much more cool headed. If he fought them, he would probably be severely injured even if he did win. Not to mention that Rank 6 warrior. 

The Rank 6 warrior was too much for him to handle right now. If Chu Shen fought with him, he could put up some resistance. Enough to last for a minute or two. However, he would still die in the end. 

To sum it all up, whatever the outcome of this fight, he would die. The perfect example of a lose-lose situation. So why should he stubbornly fight and reveal his secrets when he didn’t need to?

It would be better to take the opportunity to escape from that berserk Asura while he was obsessed with destroying the Universe Shield than to fight and die. Chu Shen had already ran over three hundred feet away using Comet Travels Through whenever he could no longer supply Qi to the shield. 

Luckily as a true martial art, it could hold it’s form for a while even without him being connected to it. As a result, Tai Ju bashed at the shield for another minute before it broke. He was so confused from grief and rage that he didn’t even notice the abnormal Qi that made up the shield that Chu Shen had conjured.

His head swiveled back and forth, looking for Chu Shen. Unfortunately, Chu Shen was already a quarter mile away inside the forest. “AAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!” Tai Ju screamed as he realized that he had been tricked. 

As Chu Shen escaped from that dangerous situation, he heard Tai Ju’s blood curdling scream and shivered. The last thing he heard as he rushed to meet with Lucas was the words Tai Ju screamed.

“I WILL AVENGE YOU BROTHER! EVEN IF IT COSTS ME MY LIFE!”





<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 113 - Camp Out</h1>

Chu Shen appeared on the edge of the road. Glancing around, he spotted a horse-drawn wagon parked in a small clearing not far from the road. Smoke trailed upwards from the other side of the wagon. Lucas and the kids were visible on the other side.

It was two days after Tai Ju had attacked him. He had run out of the forest and back onto the road after he had ran three miles away from where they had met. Then he started running to meet up with Lucas. 

Of course, he called Lucas with his comm telling them the Asura Sect had stopped their pursuit. He mentioned that one of the Agni Asura had gone mad and may come after them so to be careful. However, Lucas could take care of a lone Rank 5 Assassin fairly easy. Especially since their invisibility was neutralized with their scanners.

Lucas and the teachers had decided to stop and camp on the side of the road. Since they no longer had to flee for their  lives, it was better to let the kids rest for a bit then continue pushing them.

For the past two days, they had stayed beside the road. Chu Shen sniffed the air. The smell of cooked meat filled the air. Lucas and the teachers would catch some normal beasts from the surrounding area for food when they were hungry and coincidentally, they were cooking some now.

Chu Shen’s body seemed to became a streak of light, coving the five hundred feet in the blink of an eye. A couple of the kids jumped as Chu Shen suddenly appeared between them. A thud sounded as air compressed slightly from his speed making everyone glance over at him

Lucas was in the middle of serving meat from a large metal. He didn’t even look up at Chu Shen. Instead he used the ladle he was stirring the pot with to dish out a couple hunks of meat. He threw the bowl towards Chu Shen, who caught it without spilling anything.

Chu Shen nodded at Lucas before immediately started eating, not even taking the time to sit down. For the past two days, Chu Shen had only eaten some dried meat. Compared to the meal they were having, it was severely lacking. 

After Chu Shen had two bowls of meat, he finally wiped his mouth and sat down beside Lucas. Lucas had given up his job of dishing out food to one of the teachers who passed out food as well. They had just gotten started so there was a lot of kids lined up.

Lucas sighed. “Well, what do we do now? I mean, what’s the plan? We scared off the Asura Sect like we planned but what's the rest of the plan?”


Chu Shen sighed as well. “I don’t know exactly, but first I need to talk to one of the teachers. First i’ll go ahead and talk to those teachers about learning the warriors technique for expanding their meridians. After that, we need to set up a more permanent place for these kids. Then I can start helping them with opening their meridians.”


Lucas smiled at him. “You know, you really are a bit too kind.”


Chu Shen shrugged. “It’s a better character fault then some others.”


“Agreed. Anyways, I believe that if you ask around, you should find an appropriate teacher to help you with the warrior training.”

He nodded. “Well, I’m off then. See you later Lucas.” Lucas nodded at Chu Shen as he stood up and went over to the teacher dishing out food. The teacher glanced up at Chu Shen and gave him an annoyed glance.

“Go and wait in line. No cutting alright?” Chu Shen almost tripped when he heard that. Of course, he did look young but this was just too much. Not even recognizing the person that saved them all, twice! Truly the legendary tales of ‘having eyes but not recognizing Mt. Tai’ weren’t exaggerated at all.

There truly was blind people in the world. Chu Shen shook his head. “Uh, no. I am not here for food. I wanted to ask where I can find the teacher that can help me with Warrior cultivation techniques.”


The teacher glared at Chu Shen. “Wait until i’m done serving food before you ask that. Can’t you see i’m busy brat?”

Chu Shen finally couldn’t take it anymore. “What kind of tone is that to the person who saved your life! Twice actually!”

The teacher immediately reacted. “Daring to raise your voice to me brat! And to claim that you are the savior!? How bold of you! See if I don’t spank you silly for that!” He raised the ladle in a threatening manner at Chu Shen.

Chu Shen sighed. The people of this world not being able to sense the cultivation level of others sure was a hindrance. He thought back to when he scanned the assassins and warriors sent by the other sects. He had to admit, there was some benefits to him though.

Chu Shen didn’t feel like arguing though. Immediately, gray samurai armor appeared around Chu Shen. Intricate designs were visible on the armor. The surrounding kids gasped in shock and the teacher stumbled back slightly. He pointed his ladle at Chu Shen.

“H-h-how? None of the students know such a technique!”

Chu Shen rolled his eyes. “Because I am not one of your students you blockhead! Sheesh. You would think getting older would help you learn somethings but nope. I guess everyone can still be thick headed no matter their age.”

The teacher nodded rapidly. “I guess you are the savior then. My apologies for not knowing but you were only with us for half an hour. As for warrior cultivation techniques, ask for Su Gagi. He should be over there with the other teachers.” He pointed towards the wagon.

Chu Shen nodded. “Alright, thanks.” He started to walk over to where the teacher pointed at. The teacher watched him for a minute before one of the kids bumped him in the side with their bowl.

“Um. Can I please have some food mister?” Her big round eyes looked up at him with an irresistible pleading stare.

The teacher shook his head to clear it before smiling at the girl. “Of course, here you go.”  He was normally very sweet with such young ones. However, he was also strict about following the rules, which was why he got so upset with Chu Shen when he broke them.

Chu Shen walked up on a group of teachers all talking with each other. He hadn’t gotten rid of his Cancellation Armor since he didn’t want to repeat what had happened with the other teacher.

Upon seeing Chu Shen, all of them stood up. Chu Shen looked at them for a second. “So who is Su Gagi?”


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 114 - Warriors Techniques</h1>

“So who is Su Gagi?” The five adults stood up upon hearing Chu Shen ask this.

Most of them were puzzled. Who exactly was this kid? He was using a defense technique that wasn’t part of their school but he was familiar with one of the teachers. However, other adults became shocked. These were the ones that saw Chu Shen before he left.

The wagon driver that had thanked Chu Shen when he had rescued them earlier turned towards the other people. “I would like to introduce this young man to those who do not recognize him. He is the young master that helped us while his friend stayed behind.”

Immediately everyone's eyes lit up with recognition and they looked at this young kid with newfound respect. This was the person that saved them? He was the one that, with his servant/friend, killed their pursuers?

One of the adults on the far right cupped his hands and bowed towards Chu Shen. “Greetings. It is an honor to meet you young master. This humble one is Su Gagi, the teacher for the warrior students here.”

Chu Shen nodded. “It is an honor to meet you as well Su Gagi. I wish to talk with you about a couple things. Could you please follow me?”

“Of course young master.” Chu Shen dismissed his Cancellation Armor and walked off to towards the side of the road. Su Gagi followed him. The other adults were puzzled. What did they have to talk about?

Su Gagi himself was confused, though he didn’t show it outwardly. Chu Shen stopped and Su Gagi stopped beside him. Chu Shen turned towards him. “So, Su Gagi. I heard you are the one that teaches warrior cultivation techniques.”

Su Gagi nodded. “Yes, I am the one who teaches them.”


Chu Shen smiled. “Great, I never really studied warrior cultivation techniques. Would you mind sharing them with me?”


Su Gagi frowned. “Young master, are you a battle mage? If you are just a mage, I would not recommend you trying to learn these techniques. Any mage who has tried to do so before has either made no progress or killed themselves on accident.”

“Don’t worry, I am a battle mage.” At least by your definition, I am a battle mage. Chu Shen thought inwardly.

“Alright then young master. I will go ahead and share with you the warrior cultivation techniques. I warn you though, do not attempt to advance a rank if you are not prepared mentally. You must be steadfast in your convictions, otherwise the pain will distract you and cause your mana to deviate and destroy your body.”

“I understand, please teach me.”

Su Gagi sighed and started sharing with him the cultivation technique of warriors. “Warriors are born with a mana network. It is a series of small rivers we use to send mana outside our bodies. However, these small rivers limit our rate of absorbing mana. So warriors have learned how to expand the rivers inside their mana network.”

“Essentially, all we have to do is make the rivers bigger. However, that is a very tough job. How we accomplish it is by absorbing mana and dispersing it evenly inside our mana network without holding any inside our magic source.” 

“Eventually our mana network will then become oversaturated with mana, causing it to swell up like a balloon causing intense pain throughout our body. Though we do not know the specific reason, we assume it is because of the mana network expanding.”

“Eventually cracks will appear on the mana rivers as it is forced to expand. After it is stretched to a point where it just below snapping, you stop absorbing mana. However, if you are distracted by the pain, even for an instant, you can lose control and cause your mana streams to expand too rapidly and destroy your body.”

“Instead you must absorb the mana into your magic source and then spread out thin amounts of mana throughout you mana network. This thin amount of mana will then nourish the cracked and stretched mana rivers. The body will then heal itself, making the stretched mana rivers permanent and the body becomes even stronger.”


“Later on, each warrior must repeat this process. However, as the mana rivers have already expanded once, it requires even more mana to expand again. As a result, the pain becomes worse with each step. The body becomes even stronger as well though.”

Chu Shen nodded. All of this actually made perfect sense. As for the whole ‘we do not understand the specific reason for pain’, he did. Master Qin had previously explained to him about backlash of certain techniques.

It was because Qi would leak through the meridians and into the body. Then the body would become overloaded and could burst from the extra energy. This was the reason for the pain behind this technique. However, it was a very interesting cultivation technique.

“Thank you Su Gagi. Now, do you have a specific cultivation technique for your warrior students?”

He shook his head. “Well no. There isn’t any technique to cultivation. Instead there are some tips that teachers give. Schools are mostly about giving advice on cultivation and training them in techniques and how to fight. Other than that, schools give students resources and weapons.”

This was actually how all schools worked, including schools for mortals. Mortal schools could give advice on studying and learning along with providing tutoring or calculators. However, the actual learning was up to the student.

Chu Shen cupped his hands and gave a slight bow to Su Gagi “Alright. I think I am done talking about warrior cultivation but thank you for your time, Su Gagi.”


Su Gagi bowed. “It was an honor to talk with you young master. I will leave you then.” He walked back towards the other adults by the wagon. Upon arriving, they swarmed around him. Obviously they were very curious about what Chu Shen and Su Gagi had been talking about.

Master Ti Wu appeared in front of him in his soul form that couldn’t be seen by others unless he wanted them too. ‘So Master Ti Wu, what do you think of their cultivation system? It seems unique.’

Master Ti Wu immediately nodded. ‘I like it a lot. It is actually a lot like the Void King technique except it floods the entire minor meridian system with mana instead of just circulating through it.’ 

‘It has a stronger nourishing effect to the body compared to normal cultivators, but compared to the Void King technique, it still lacks power. With one round it is equal to five circulations of the Void King technique but the Void King technique can be repeated multiple times. That is why it is superior. However, the benefit to discharging massive amounts of Qi is the true benefit.’

Chu Shen nodded. While he had some similar thoughts, Master Ti Wu was obviously a better judge. He even found several things that Chu Shen hadn’t seen, like the fact it strengthened the body.

‘So Master Ti Wu, should I learn their cultivation system?’
























<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 115 - Ti Wu’s Joy</h1>

‘So Master Ti Wu, should I learn their cultivation system?’

Master Ti Wu looked at Chu Shen blankly for a second. ‘Should you learn their cultivation system? YOU IDIOT! I DON’T EVEN KNOW IF YOU SHOULD BE CALLED MY DISCIPLE WITH THAT KIND OF QUESTION! You stupid brat!’

Chu Shen flinched as Master Ti Wu started yelling at him. His head started pounding as his loud voice echoed inside it. Master Ti Wu looked at him before sighing.

‘Do you not understand what this system is! It’s a unique cultivation system that allows one to use an attack far greater than should be possible for their cultivation level. Expanding the meridians just once can lead to you using an attack five levels stronger than your current level. If you keep on expanding your meridians, than attacks five stages above yours is not out of the question!’

‘Sure it might waste all the energy inside you in doing so. But everything has a price to pay. Don’t you understand? Normally such a boost of power would come at the cost of crippling your meridians or destroying your arm. To only be exhausted and still have that kind of might…. It is unthinkable!’

‘So many warriors would sell their arm for that kind of thing. Not to mention that using your null Qi, you can quickly refill your Qi by absorbing other people's energy. So using such strong attacks repeatedly, so long as you have Qi to absorb, isn’t out of the question! To be honest, if the Void Sect had this cultivation system, I guarantee that it would have not gone down so easily.’

Chu Shen finally started getting it. This cultivation system was practically tailor made for him! Unleashing an attack far beyond his level and being able to do so limitlessly and without backlash. Such a technique….. Was truly frightening.

Chu Shen nodded. ‘Alright master, i’ll get started right away then.’

Master Ti Wu nodded. ‘You better. I’ll protect you and guide you while you do. Go away from the the group though, we don’t want them to hear you screaming in agony.’

Chu Shen nodded and quickly dashed away, using <Comet Travels Through> to surge forward with blinding speed. After he was a half-mile away, he stopped beside a large tree. He sat beneath the tree after scouting for primordial beasts.

Finally he started absorbing Qi. It surged into his dantian which was slightly drained from using <Comet Travels Through>. After it was full, he controlled his Qi to surge into his minor meridians. Not a single bit of Qi was left inside his dantian.

As Chu Shen kept absorbing Qi, an intense sensation came over him. His entire body started to itch. He continued absorbing Qi, ignoring the sensation. His meridians were filled to the brim and he had to fight every second to prevent his Qi from going back into his dantian. 

The itching turned into a pinching sensation as time went on. At this point, one of his minor meridians cracked. Chu Shen let out a grunt as an intense burning sensation completely engulfed his left arm.

‘Keep it up Chu Shen! You can’t be distracted! Keep going!’ Ti Wu yelled at Chu Shen.

Chu Shen gritted his teeth and continued on. The burning sensation spread from his left arm to the rest of his body as his minor meridians started cracking. By this time, Chu Shen had already started screaming from the pain.

As the minor meridians cracked they started becoming bigger. At first it was barely noticeable. Soon though, they became fifty percent bigger around. Several cracks were in every single minor meridian. The burning sensation became so strong, that Chu Shen could have sworn he was inside a fire. 

He could barely think straight. However, he kept absorbing Qi and containing it inside his minor meridians. Master Ti Wu was kind of shocked at the willpower that Chu Shen showed.

Chu Shen had just enough clarity of thought to realize that his meridians, which were now twice as big, seemed to have reached their limit. Anymore and they would shatter. Remembering what Su Gagi had said, Chu Shen stopped forcing his Qi and allowed it to flow back into his dantian.

Then he let a trickle of Qi to permeate all of his minor meridians. He observed his minor meridians with his spiritual sense. Using the trickle of Qi as fuel, his meridians repaired themselves. Growing new walls, his minor meridians fixed the cracks and gaps inside it. 

After he was done, Qi surged into his body and expanded his dantian. It was only a very slight amount though, not letting him advance to Martial Practitioner Level 10 from Level 9. It was from the widened minor meridians, allowing more Qi from the outside to flow into him.

Apparently this was how warriors expanded their dantian afterwards. Chu Shen however, wasn’t interested in such things. He got to his feet, weaty and shaky from his painful experience.

Master Ti Wu faced him. ‘Well, how was it?’

Chu Shen shook his head. ‘It was definitely painful.’

‘Well, if you didn’t have a Void Constitution it would have been a lot more painful. Remember, your body doesn’t reject Qi otherwise it would have been twice as painful.’

Oh yeah. Chu Shen shrugged. ‘Well, I’m glad I don’t have to go through that.’

‘So you brat, are you ready to advance to a Rank 3 warrior? Right now you are only a Rank 2 warrior.’

Chu Shen paled. ‘Uh. I should get back before Lucas starts worrying. Bye master!’ Chu Shen left for the campsite quickly.

Master Ti Wu laughed and laughed as Chu Shen ran. ‘Aw man. I haven’t had so much fun since the Void Sect disappeared. Honestly, watching that pained expression brings back so many memories.’

Countless faces contorted in pain flashed through his mind at the moment. He became slightly gloomy at the memories of his former students. A moment later he shook his head. No use remembering the past. Right now he had a new student to tortu- ahem. Teach, a new student to teach.


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 116 - Opening</h1>

Chu Shen rested for a day at the camp. The next morning he woke up and immediately went to find Lucas. He found out Lucas had gone hunting and would be back soon. After an hour, Lucas came back with several dead primordial beasts.

Chu Shen went up to Lucas. “So Lucas, have we decided to do anything?”

Lucas nodded. “Yeah, since you came back the teachers decided it’s time to move on. We need to go to the town nearby and buy some supplies. After that we head out to the ruins of Garson.”

Chu Shen gave him an inquisitive look. “The ruins of Garson? What is that exactly?”

“Well, apparently there is some ruins nearby. It was a small town that didn’t have powerful mages or warriors. A small family group of Class 4 apes took moved by the town and was harassing the people there. Eventually the townspeople decided to leave since they couldn’t even farm properly.”

“As a result, Garson was abandoned, becoming a ruins. No one goes there because it’s a small farming town and it’s pretty far from other cities. There is simply nothing worth fighting those Class 4 apes for in Garson.” 

“It’s about forty more miles from the town we are stopping by. It should take about a week, maybe a week and a half since we’re not trying to move at top speed like before.”

Chu Shen nodded. “Alright, we should get moving.” Not long after, they left to resupply at the closest town. Two weeks later they arrived at the outskirts of Garson. That is, if a rotten wooden fence can be called the outskirts of any town.

Upon nearing Garson, Chu Shen and Lucas went ahead. They encountered over twenty of the apes that the previous citizens of Garson had problems with. However, only nine of these apes were Class 4 apes and these Class 4 apes were all apes in their prime.

The other apes were either old and had regressed to Class 3 apes or were young and had yet to mature. Chu Shen didn’t want to kill them and neither did Lucas. So Lucas and Chu Shen both defeated the Class 4 apes and then let them go. Immediately the apes left, scampering off scared for their lives.

With the problems of the apes solved, the remnants of the Rising Tide Sect flooded into the abandoned town. The teachers, along with Chu Shen and Lucas, used the materials they bought from the town to fix up the various houses.

Boards were nailed into place over holes in the buildings, with a hand being used instead of a hammer since they couldn’t afford to buy one. The town was in surprisingly good condition after being abandoned for ten years. By the end of the day, they had enough houses for all of the kids and the teachers.

The next day, Chu Shen was woken up by Master Ti Wu appearing in his soul form once again. ‘Hey, brat! It’s time for you to get to work here! It’s time for you to start changing these kids lives.’

Chu Shen yawned. “Ahh. What master?”

‘Hey! Keep your voice down, use your soul to communicate. Anyways, it’s time for you to start opening these kids meridians. Also, open those teachers meridians too. They should be able to appreciate the impact a lot more than those kids.’

Chu Shen nodded. ‘Okay master. I’ll start with the adults if that's alright.’

Master Ti Wu nodded. ‘I was about to suggest that actually. Lucky guess brat, you better get started.’

Chu Shen found Su Gagi afterwards. He was the only teacher Chu Shen actually knew of. After he found him, Chu Shen took him aside, away from everyone else.

He sat down next to Su Gagi and looked him in the eyes. Of course, Chu Shen had to stare almost directly upwards to do so. “Listen Su Gagi, I need to know if I can trust you with a secret. This could get the entire world to hunt you down so I need to know if I can.”

Su Gagi was visibly startled at this news. He had thought Chu Shen wanted to ask him some questions about warriors again, or maybe mages this time. ‘This must be extremely important for it our savior to say something like this.’

He gave a slight bow to Chu Shen. “You have saved us all so I do not doubt that none of us will betray you. All of the teachers here loved their students, to the point of laying down their lives for them. Anyone that was untrustworthy or was here for benefits has long since fled. Otherwise we would not have stayed with our students when the other sects tried to kill us.”

Chu Shen nodded. That made perfect sense. “Alright then, I believe I can trust you. Now, I have picked up a secret art that can allow me to change someone's talent. Or rather, to create new mana rivers inside a person.”

What followed was the usual denial, disbelief, and then amazement. After Su Gagi had calmed down, Chu Shen explained what he was going to do. “I am going to send my Qi, I mean mana, into your body. I want you to send your mana along the same path as my mana. Eventually you will encounter a barrier. Force your way past and then you will open up a new mana river.”

Su Gagi nodded, still in shock from this astonishing fact. Inside he felt both hopeful and condescending. How could this method possibly create a new mana river?  But at the same time, he wished he could create a new mana river. He himself was only a rank 4 warrior. He didn’t even have one mana river.

Chu Shen had him sit in the lotus position before sitting behind him. Using his spiritual sense, he had come up with a route through Su Gagi’s minor meridians on his back to the major meridian in his left arm. 

Placing his hands on Su Gagi’s back, he took a deep breath. “Are you ready Su Gagi? Because we begin in three, two, one, now!” Chu Shen sent a small stream of Qi from his body. He had already disabled the nullification ability of his null Qi.

Su Gagi gasped as what seemed to be pure ice cold water flowed into his body. It first appeared where Chu Shen had his hands. He could sense it flowing through his body very slowly.

“Concentrate Teacher Su Gagi, I need you to concentrate. Make your mana flow in your body where mine does.” Startled, Su Gagi realized, he wasn’t really helping Chu Shen. 

Su Gagi didn’t really know how to do what Chu Shen needed. He could control his mana, but not very finely. Concentrating, Su Gagi tried to force his mana to follow Chu Shen’s.

Chu Shen was starting to get frustrated. Su Gagi’s mana kept going all over the place. While his mana was in the right general area, his back, it was in over fifty different branches of minor meridians. This just wasn’t going well at all.

‘Fine. If I can’t make him go to the exact area, then I’ll just go straight to the major meridian. He should be able to follow me there.’ With that, Chu Shen had his Qi swiftly flow to Su Gagi’s left arm’s major meridian.

Su Gagi was immediately flustered. He had just starting getting the hang of manipulating his mana internally when that ice cold mana moved to his arm. Attempting to follow it, he manipulated his mana towards his arm.

As he got close to the ice cold sensation, his mana stopped. Something was blocking it. Su Gagi was stunned. This was his body, yet he didn’t even know that there was something inside his body that his mana couldn’t pass through?

“That is the barrier that I told you about. Gather as much mana as possible and force your way past it and you will gain a mana river.” Chu Shen was relieved that it was actually starting to work it out now. Though, he wasn’t sure if it was by skill or by luck that Su Gagi’s mana had reached the major meridian.

Su Gagi obeyed and collected as much of his mana as he could. Controlling it, he forced it towards the barrier. From the way Chu Shen had talked, it seemed as though this barrier was formidable. However, when he barely even touched it, it seemed to disappear.

A slight amount of mana flowed into him, increasing the mana inside his magic source by about ten percent. When Chu Shen saw this he was confused. Why did it seem so easy? But then it dawned on him. 

The amount of mana Su Gagi had was already equal to a Martial Scholar. When one breaks through a meridian, all of the impurities are pushed out of the meridian and are stored in the other meridians, making them harder to breakthrough. As a result, the first major meridian is the easiest.

The amount of mana needed to breakthrough the first major meridian was as much mana as a martial Student had. However, because of Su Gagi being a rank 4 warrior, he had more than ten times that amount. This was a side effect of cultivating an unorthodox cultivation method. 

Su Gagi gasped as he felt a river flowing just past his body. This was the mana river! Chu Shen had not lied! He could truly change their talent! Eagerly, he forced the mana river to connect to his body, making it his own. He smiled unconsciously as it went through him.

Chu Shen had been enlightened as to how their cultivation techniques corresponded well together. One could say it was a dual cultivation method that practically defied the heavens!

He sighed. “Su Gagi, I believe we can unlock another mana river, maybe two. Are you willing?”

Su Gagi did not answer right away but instead kowtowed to Chu Shen. “Thank you savior, thank you! You have given me what I have always hoped for, the ability to become a mage. Thank you!”

 Chu Shen did not stop him, it was better for thanks to be expressed this way than in other ways. “You’re welcome. Now, should we continue?”

Su Gagi bowed. “Yes, if you can savior.”



<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 117 - Kids Turn</h1>

Su Gagi was able to open up another two mana rivers with Chu Shen’s help.  Afterwards, Chu Shen found the other teachers to help them open up their mana rivers as well. Some of them, like the mage teachers, could only open up one. 

This was because their magic source, the dantian, was filled from them connecting their previously opened mana rivers, major meridians. They could only open up one more mana river with the mana they had inside their magic source. It was actually similar to a martial artist breaking through to the next level in that regard.

All of them, however, were able to become Rank 4 mages with a few becoming Rank 5 mages. Not one was able to become a Rank 6 mage. Chu Shen not only opened their mana rivers, he also opened their mana network or minor meridians. This way, all of them were battle mages. Though of course, these new battle mages would need to expand their mana network. As of right now, they were only Rank 1 warriors.

Afterwards, Chu Shen became a bit flustered. Just how was he going to open the kids meridians? They were only nine years old at most! Well, besides the fourteen year old kids he had seen before. As for the others….

This was going to be tough. They needed the kids to sit very still and concentrate hard as well. Just how were they going to convince them to do that? Chu Shen found this problem abnormally difficult. Finally he brought it up to Lucas.

Lucas, upon hearing the idea, smiled at him. “That's all you need to do? Don’t you know in my universe they called that school? All you have to do is give them a treat and they’ll fall right in line. How about I make them a little toy and if they do as we ask we give them the toy? I could make little action figures or dolls. I bet they would love that.”

Chu Shen just gaped at Lucas for a while. Now that he thought about it, it seemed like such a simple idea. Why didn’t he think of that. Finally, he nodded at Lucas. “Alright Lucas, you go ahead and make a sample of each kind of toy. Then we can use it to motivate them while you make more.”

Lucas nodded. “Okay then. I’ll be back in a bit.”

Chu Shen had to wait twenty minutes before Lucas came back with two small dolls tucked under his hands. Chu Shen quickly walked over to him, impatient to get started. “What took you so long? The fabricator only takes a minute to make something so trivial.”

Lucas shrugged. “Well, it wasn’t as easy as you think. I had several models already preloaded onto the fabber. The only problem was it required some materials we just don’t have. I had to design them on the spot and replace the materials just to make it. Than I went ahead and made each one have a slight variation in it’s face and body so that every child will have a unique one. They should like that.”

Chu Shen nodded. “Fine then. Let me get the teachers, they should be able to help us get the kids together.” The teachers were concerned about the abilities of the their students but were put at ease from the dolls that Lucas had made. 

Working together, they brought all of the students to an empty courtyard. Once there, Chu Shen explained to the kids that he would be need their help with something and if they did they would get a toy, which he showed them. All of the kids seemed excited.

All except the two teenagers at the back. The boy seemed to be angry and the girl was depressed. Both were in complete contrast to the other happy kids. Chu Shen knew why they felt that way. He had asked the teachers after seeing them around the camp. They were the two disciples that caused the sects downfall.

One could imagine the kind of suffering they were going through mentally. The other kids had put up a sort of mental barrier, blockading off those painful memories. However, they most certainly did distance themselves from the cause of those memories. 

Isolated from most comfort and without any support besides each other, it wasn’t a wonder the two teens became depressed. As for the anger, it was understandable. To have seen such bloodshed and yet no one seemed to be doing anything about it would cause anyone to be angry. Especially when such pointless things such as passing out dolls was introduced.

After the students were informed, they all left back to their various rooms. Except for the two teenagers. Chu Shen had asked them to stay. Eventually Chu Shen approached them.

“So I understand that the Rising Tide Sect was destroyed because of you two.” Chu Shen said matter of factly when he stood in front of them. Upon saying so, the girl burst into tears while the boys face became red with anger.

He jumped up, shaking his fist at Chu Shen. “What do you mean we caused the destruction of the Rising Tide! We had nothing to do with it, it was those other sects that destroyed the Rising Tide! Not us!”

Chu Shen nodded at the boys outburst. “Well, that might be true. Except they only attacked the Rising Tide sect because you were in it.”

The boy just stood there, his hand clenched into a tight fist. Chu Shen watched him before he suddenly nodded. “Alright you two, I decided. Now, the other kids are all too young to grasp the true meaning of what this is, but you guys can.

I can unlock more mana rivers inside you and unlock your mana network as well. That is, if you are up to it. With the newfound power you can grasp, I believe getting revenge on the Ice Dragon, Golden Palm, or Asura sect would be easy.”

The girl looked up sharply as soon as Chu Shen mentioned unlocking more mana rivers. The boy seemed to become even more agitated after Chu Shen mentioned revenge. For a second it seemed as though he would snap. Finally, he calmed down.

He faced Chu Shen. “How can we know what you say is true?”

Chu Shen shrugged. “Well, if you ask the teachers they can tell you I already unlocked extra mana rivers in them. If you don’t believe you can trust what they say, then there is nothing else I can do to prove to you that what I say is true.”


The girl spoke up this time. “Is it dangerous at all?”

The boy swiveled towards her. “What do you mean ‘is it dangerous’!? Even if it was I would still do it! We both saw our mom die because of them!”


The girl sniffed before facing Chu Shen. “We will do it. No matter the cost.” 

Chu Shen smiled. “Well, it won’t actually cost anything and it’s not dangerous either. All I want is promise you will not reveal what I do to anyone except the teachers and your classmates here.”


They both nodded without hesitation. Chu Shen smiled “Excellent! Now, I do believe we should introduce ourselves. My name is Chu Shen.”

The boy smiled. “I’m Aslo.”

The girl looked away shyly. “I’m Chrissa.”

Chu Shen clapped his hands. “Nice to meet you Chrissa and Aslo. I believe we will be good friends.”



<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 118 - Another Puzzle Piece</h1>

Chu Shen faced the two kids after they introduced each other. “So. Are you ready to begin?”

Aslo nodded. “I’m ready.” The girl nodded as well.

Chu Sen nodded. “Alright then. Aslo, you are a battle mage and so is Chrissa, correct?”

“Sure am.” Aslo said, pride evident in his smile.

“Okay then. Let me go ahead and start with you then. Sit down over here.” Chu Shen approached Aslo and sat down behind him. Chu Shen closed his eyes and used his spiritual sense on Aslo. When he did though, Chu Shen’s eyes flew open in shock.

He stood up abruptly, pointing a finger at Aslo. “You, you… You’re already a Rank 4 mage!”

Aslo looked at him in confusion. “Well yeah. In another week I’ll be a Rank 5 mage as well.”  Chu Shen just stared at him, his mouth wide open. Just what kind of cultivation speed was this?!

Then Chu Shen remembered something he read at the library. A mage can connect their mana rivers to their magic source at any time. This is why warriors were considered inferior to mages. A mage could reach tremendous power in less than a year. A warrior needed years to reach the same amount of power.

Despite being able to connect mana rivers at any time, it is recommended that mages connect one mana river a week. The reason for this was that the body would become stressed and experience pain. The more mana rivers opened at once, the more intense the pain. A mage once connected five at once and died after his body exploded. The mage was only nine years old and had been too impatient to impress his parents.

When you open a meridian, the body becomes flush with mana which strengthens it. However, the body must adapt to this new amount of mana inside it. Otherwise, just as with martial arts, it can overload the body and cause it to self destruct. Which, of course, explains the pain of those that open multiple major meridians.

As Chu Shen followed this thought, he immediately realized something. How could the teachers he helped with their major meridians withstand that pain? He remembered though, that their reactions to the first meridian were to immediately connect it to their magic source. After that though, they wouldn’t connect any of the newly opened mana rivers. 

Now it all made sense! They were worried about overloading their body with mana from those new mana rivers. As a result, they did not connect the mana river to their magic source. Most likely they would wait after a week to connect their mana rivers to their magic source.

Chu Shen realized just how ignorant he had been to this issue. Maybe he needed to warn the kids when he helped them open their major meridians otherwise it could be very bad indeed. 

Chu Shen, who had been lost in thought, was rudely awakened by two hands that grabbed his shoulder and started shaking him. “Uh, hello? Chu Shen are you there? Come on! You need to open those mana rivers for me right?!” 

Chu Shen brushed Aslo’s arm off. “Hey! Let go!”

Aslo shrugged. “I just got a bit tired of waiting for you to stop staring off into space.”

Chu Shen smiled. “Fine, I just needed a bit of time to think. Anyways, go ahead and sit back down so we can get back to opening up your major meridians.”


Aslo sat down with his back to Chu Shen. “So what is this major meridian you spoke of.”

Chu Shen froze for a second before sitting down behind Aslo. He casually explained his accident slip up to Aslo as he did. “It’s nothing. Just another name for mana rivers.” A drop of sweat fell down his forehead as he spoke.

Aslo nodded sagely. “Of course of course. I just didn’t recognize the name that’s all. So, who calls it that exactly?”

Chu Shen’s shirt was starting to become damp from all the sweat. “Well, that’s not important. We need to get back to you opening your mana rivers.” 

Aslo immediately became distracted. “Well then, let’s get on with it! I need to become stronger!”


“Alright then. Now focus. I am going to put my mana inside your body. You need to make your mana follow mine. Eventually, if you follow my mana properly, you will sense something blocking your mana. All you need to do is break through that barrier and it will unlock a mana river.”

Aslo’s face scrunched up. “How is that possible though?”

“Well you see, inside our bodies are all mana rivers. Most of them are blocked off from us. Just like a dam, it prevents any mana from coming inside us. However, by breaking the dam, we can allow the mana river to flow. The mana river will be off course though. We still need to force the mana river to flow into our magic source.”

Aslo still looked confused but eventually he nodded. “Alright then. I may not understand what a dam is but I don’t need to in order to get a new mana river. Let’s get started then!”


“Hold on.”

“Now what! Why can’t we just get started already?”

Chu Shen shook his head. Aslo was quite impatient. Though, that was understable since his mother had died in front of him. “I just wanted to make sure that you know not to link any more mana rivers after you open them. I don’t want your body to explode or anything.”


Aslo rolled his eyes. “Of course I know not to. I’m not an idiot after all. Now can we get on with it. Sitting on the ground is not exactly comfortable, my butt is falling asleep.”

Chu Shen smirked at that. “Fine, let’s get started.” Chu Shen wasn’t able to help Aslo much since he could only open up one more major meridian, just like with the teachers. 

However, doing this was life changing. Remember that those four powerful sects had only ten Rank 6 adventurers and none that were of a higher rank. With this, the two twins became a Rank 7 and Rank 8 battle mage. This would let either of them become almost unrivaled in the city they were raised in. They could be considered the elites of the world by now!

Chu Shen just helplessly shrugged his head. Maybe it was time for him start advancing his cultivation level again. Otherwise, the protector may just become the protectee in only a month.

He then helped Chrissa unblock another meridian as well. She was silent throughout, only nodding or shaking her head when Chu Shen asked a question. 

Aslo looked on helplessly as Chu Shen helped her. His sister was an outgoing person before but ever since she saw her mother killed she had clammed up. She barely even spoke a word unless it was to him.

He sighed. They had truly had a tragic life so far.








<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 119 - Mages Abilities</h1>

Chu Shen had just finished with unblocking Aslo and Chrissa’s meridians. He could not, however, start on the other kids. The reason was because Lucas had not come back with the toys for the kids yet. While he was waiting, he continued talking to the twins. 

He learned a couple interesting things about them. Their father had been a Rank 2 warrior and used his strength to become a lumberjack. They had a happy but simple life with their father and mother. Unfortunately, he was killed by a magical beast while chopping down trees in the forest.

A Rising Tide Sect member brought them his body. They had tried to rescue him but were too late. Upon delivering his body, the Rising Tide member felt guilty and offered to take the twins to be tested for potential. That was the reason they joined the Rising Tide Sect. Everything after that was the very sad history that Chu Shen had heard before.

Ten minutes later, Lucas finally appeared. He carried a satchel on his shoulder that Chu Shen had inscribed the [Shrinking Inscription] on. Chu Shen stopped talking with the twins and went over to Lucas. “So Lucas, you got the toys?”

Lucas set down the satchel and nodded. “Sure do.” He reached inside the satchel and pulled out a toy mage. He had on black robes with his hands lifted up, palms facing outwards. A fireball was in the palm of it’s hands. Lucas smiled at Chu Shen. “Pretty cool right? Now watch this!” He pushed a button on the toys back and the fireballs shot forward about two feet.

Chu Shen smiled. “You’re right, that is pretty cool.”

Lucas smiled back. “I know right? There’s springs in the hands so that you can load the fireballs and shoot them. I also have ones with lightning, ice balls, rocks, and wind scythes. I also have a couple warrior ones that their arms chop down instead.”

Chu Shen grinned. “Well, that should definitely be cool. How about the girls though.”

Lucas’ grin faded a bit. “Oh, yeah. Well I have a couple of girl dolls in dresses with tiny brushes and extra clothes.”

Chu Shen nodded. “Well, I’ll let them choose. I may need you to make more so stay close.” Lucas grunted in confirmation. After that, Chu Shen left to gather a few more kids to open their mana rivers.

While he was doing so, Aslo came up to Lucas. “Hey, what is that you got there?” He pointed at the toy in Lucas hands.

He held up the mage. “This? This is a toy mage that I made for as a reward for those that open up a new mana river.”

Aslo nodded. “Well, me and my sister Chrissa,” he gestured towards Chrissa behind him, “just got done with opening up a mana river. Do you think we can have one?”

Lucas nodded. “Here you go kid.” He handed Aslo the mage. “My names Lucas by the way, what’s yours?”

Aslo replied off-hand, absorbed into studying the toy. “My names Aslo.”


Lucas immediately became intrigued. He had spent time with the other teachers and kids after all. He had learned the name of the twins from them but never actually approached them since he was usually busy. Now he was able to see them face to face.

“Hey, Aslo. I heard you were a Rank 3 mage. Is that true?” Lucas asked casually.

Aslo looked up. His face puffed up with pride. “Well actually i’m a Rank 4 mage now.”

Lucas smiled. “Well, how about a duel then? I was getting bored and I need the practice.”

Aslo shrugged. “I don’t know. I am pretty new to this whole mage thing. It’s barely even been a month since I became one. I only know a couple spells.”


Lucas walked off a bit before making a come-at-me-bro gesture towards Aslo. “Don’t worry, this is only a spar after all. I’ll go easy, I swear.”

Aslo shrugged before putting his fists up. “Alright then.”

Lucas held up his hand. “On my mark. 3….2…..1….begin!”

Immediately Aslo held up his hand, palm pointed at Lucas. “Flames gather in my hand and create balls of fire. Go forth, Fireball Barrage!” As Aslo finished his chant, six fireballs appeared in front of his outstretched palm. Aslo thrust his palm towards Lucas. When he did, the fireballs flew towards Lucas, one after another.

Lucas reacted immediately, firing beams of ice from the beast core in his palm. The first beam hit the first fireball, causing it to explode. Lucas hit two more but the resulting blasts knocked his aim off slightly. The fourth fireball was already in front of him before he could shoot it.

Lucas leaned left, barely dodging the fourth fireball. The fifth one, however, caught him on the shoulder and sent him flying backwards. As he did though, Lucas legs seemed to explode! Fire streaked from them as Lucas not only stabilized himself mid-air, but also flew upwards above Aslo.

Aslo had not been slacking though. “Flames gather here before me. Create a dragons breath to destroy the enemies in front of me. Go forth, Dragon’s Fire!” Perhaps due to the longer chant, the flames were much more intense. A cone like flame shot towards Lucas.

They bathed him in fire, causing his skin to melt slightly. Lucas panicked somewhat when that happened. He opened his mouth and a high pitched squeal came out of it. The noise was deafening and caused Aslo to falter. When Aslo did so, the Dragon’s Fire sputtered out. That sonic weapon was just Lucas’ voice modulator that he had tweaked a bit.

When the Dragon’s Fire went out, Lucas immediately landed on the ground. Digging his hands into the ground, he pulled up a hunk of rock. Using this rock as a shield, he charged towards Aslo. Aslo continuously pounded the rock shield with fireballs while retreating backwards.

Each time a fireball hit, the shield would slam into Lucas making him pause for a half second. The rock shield also had small craters from when the fireballs exploded. Unfortunately, he could only create twelve fireballs before Lucas reached him. Comparing Lucas and Aslo’s speed, it was obvious that Lucas was superior.

By the time Lucas reached him, his rock shield was a mess. Scorch marks covered the front of it and cracks were spread throughout it. Lucas had cheated slightly though. He used the earth Qi from his beast core to prevent the rock shield from being destroyed by firing earth Qi into the rock shield and making it even thicker.

Upon reaching Aslo, Lucas decided to stop goofing around. Aiming at Aslo with his hand, a yellowish-brown beam struck Aslo in the leg. Immediately rock enclosed his leg, forcing Aslo to a stop. Lucas didn’t stop there though. Instead, the beam of Qi traveled upwards, completely enclosing Aslo in rock except his head.

Aslo’s face showed a panicked look along with anger. Suddenly he started chanting again. “Flames gather, create that which I want. Create that which can destroy what I want. Gather into a sphere so that I may throw it at mine enemies as I wish. Go forth, Apocalypse Ball!”

As Aslo chanted, a ball of fire appeared before him. It was only the size of his fist, the same size as the other fireballs. Because of that Lucas hadn’t been worried. As Aslo chanted though, the fireball started doubling in size with every passing moment. By the time he finished chanting, the fireball was as big as a house.

Aslo started yelling at Lucas. “Lucas, this is the only Rank 4 magic I know! All of the others were Rank 3 or Rank 2! You should really stop fighting, I’m not sure how well I can control this Apocalypse Ball!” His face was pale and covered in sweat, his brow furrowed in concentration.

Lucas stood in front of the Apocalypse Ball, his arms covering his face. He could feel the heat from where he stood and it was like a blazing furnace. He spread his arms wide. “Come on then! I can take it! Hit me with your best shot if you think it can take me down!”

Aslo gritted his teeth. “Then don’t blame me if you die!” He frowned in concentration as the Apocalypse Ball surged towards Lucas. The Apocalypse Ball did not explode but rather enveloped Lucas in a world of fire and heat. After Lucas was in the direct cent of the Apocalypse Ball it exploded. Lucas didn’t move, but his fake skin burned off completely.

Other than that, Lucas was not damaged in the slightest. Aslo looked at Lucas in a sort of horror. That strike took up all of his mana. Lucas hadn’t even used his mana shield yet he could withstand that! That was the equivalent of a Rank 5 warriors full out attack and yet Lucas didn’t even flinch!

Then suddenly Aslo recoiled. Lucas had transformed from a normal human into a metallic beast! Chu Shen suddenly appeared behind Aslo. Seeing Lucas the way he was, he stopped, taken aback. Just what had happened here? He had heard some explosions while he was talking with the teachers about what student to start on next. So he ran here only to find a stark naked Lucas.

Chu Shen appeared in front of Lucas like a ghost. “Hey, buddy.” He whispered. “You do realize that your skin and clothes are gone right?” Lucas immediately looked down. His face showed embarrassment but it looked weird without any skin.

Chu Shen turned towards Aslo. “Don’t worry, this is just an ability of Lucas. He can turn his body into metal when he needs to. It’s a unique mana shield like mine.” To demonstrate, his gray Cancellation Armor appeared around him.

Aslo nodded. “You sure do have some weird techniques Chu Shen.”

Chu Shen turned towards Lucas. “Come on Lucas, we need to get you some new skin. Why don’t we try that carbon fiber mesh skin you were talking about. I know you didn’t want to change your skin but since the old one is gone….”


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 120 - Proposal</h1>

While Lucas was finishing up with getting his new skin done, Chu Shen was able to start on the kids. The first kid was a boy that was eight years old. If he was any indicator on how this was going to go, Chu Shen was in for a rough ride.

The boy constantly asked questions even after Chu Shen had answered them. He could barely sit still for the one meridian that Chu Shen could open for him. He was only a Rank 2 mage since they were considered too immature to fully awaken their abilities.

Slowly Chu Shen worked his way down the line. That cheery and hyper kid was, unfortunately, an exception. Most of the other kids were gloomy and depressed. You could see their sadness as plain as day. Their seriousness helped Chu Shen go through all 81 kids in only five days.

After Chu Shen finished opening the kids meridians, he went to talk with the teachers. What they needed to decide now was the future of these kids. Chu Shen could make them strong but they weren’t soldiers. It was like giving a child a gun. Even if they could kill someone, they wouldn’t have the mental fortitude to do it on purpose.

Chu Shen decided to approach the teachers about this problem. “We can all agree that those sect’s won’t leave us alone. If they discover that Lucas and I tricked them, they would immediately set out to kill us.

“We need to take them out before they take us out. Also, I bet those kids want revenge for their friends, teachers, and loved ones that were killed. We need to face those sects sooner rather than later.”


The teachers all nodded. One of them spoke up first. “Allowing the kids to take revenge is a good idea. I would say that in four or five years their hearts will be hardened enough to kill.”

Chu Shen shook his head. “Well, I agree to that assessment. Unfortunately, we don’t have time. Due to some…. special circumstances, Lucas and I may leave at any time with no warning. It could be tomorrow or it could be in a year. There is no guaranteed time.”

All of the teachers showed shock upon hearing that. The one that had first spoke immediately cried out in protest. “What?! If you leave, how can we  protect ourselves?! Please, don’t leave!” The others cried out in agreement. When Chu Shen mentioned leaving, they became aware of just how much they had come to depend upon this thirteen year old and his bodyguard.

Chu Shen shrugged helplessly. “Unfortunately this is something that I have no control over. I can’t stop nor delay it. You will all simply have to accept it for what it is.”

The teachers spent over half an hour trying to convince Chu Shen to stay but Chu Shen couldn’t tell them the reason why he had to leave. Of course, the reason was because of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. If it left, then so would Lucas and Chu Shen. They wouldn’t have a choice in the matter.

Eventually though they managed to accept this fact and moved onto the more pressing matter of the kids. One of the teachers looked at the others. “So, does anyone have viable options? We need to act quickly now since we don’t know how long our savior will be with us.”

A teacher at the end of the table stood up. “I think I have an idea. What if we……” He started explaining his idea but it was shot down pretty quickly. Other teachers introduced their ideas as well but every one of them seemed to be impossible or had some sort of major flaw.

Finally there was a teacher that had an idea that didn’t have any real noticeable flaws. “I know everyone hates the Asura Sect but no one can deny that they are very good at training warriors. I actually studied some of their training methods and I believe we can adapt it to ourselves.

“The Asura Sect would take their students and teach them how to cultivate and learn a couple abilities. After that they would be equipped with weapons and armor before being dropped off next to a magic beast hunting zone. There they were required to hunt down magical beasts each day for food.

“If they didn’t then they wouldn’t be fed at all. The students were trained there for a year before they would then be taken to dueling arenas. There the students would then fight and kill other members of the arena. If they survived there for another year, they were considered as members of the Asura Sect.”

The teachers faces turned ugly upon hearing that. Even Chu Shen was shocked at how ruthless the Asura Sect was to their students. 

“How is this a suitable method for raising our students? We know how the Asura Sect turned out from the fact that they killed our sect down to the last man, woman, and child.” One of the teachers asked, clearly disturbed by what the other teacher was suggesting.

The one that proposed the idea shook his head. “I am not suggesting the arena part. That is just too cruel for young ones such as these. Instead, I suggest taking the kids to a magical beast hunting zone.

“There we can set up a temporary base like we have here and hunt down beasts for their training. Of course, we would be protecting them from the sidelines so that they won’t be killed by the beasts. 
“With that they can get used to killing and gain experience fighting. We can also have training duels in the camp so they can become experienced with fighting against humans as well.

“However long it takes for them to gain a killing edge is how long it takes for them to become truly strong. Once we judge them to be of the right level, we can go forward with destroying the Golden Palm, Ice Dragon, and Asura Sect.”

The other teachers adopted a thoughtful look after hearing the entire proposition. “So will there be rewards for hunting more?” One of the teachers asked.

The one that proposed the idea shrugged. “I’m not sure. I figured we can all work out the details together. As far as I can tell though, this seems to be the only idea that can take less than a year.”

Everyone nodded. One of them turned to Chu Shen. “We have been kind of rude haven’t we? We haven’t even asked if the savior agrees with our proposition. Please savior, is there anything more you would like to add?”

Chu Shen shook his head. “No, I can’t think of anything really. I actually grew up in a small town that was attacked by magical beast hordes all the time. That was how I grew up being able to kill without thinking too deeply. Honestly, this sort of training method is the best one if we can assure everyone’s security.

“The best way to do that, in my opinion, is to choose a beast forest with low rank magical beasts. I think we should go to a forest with the average ranked beast at Rank 3. After everyone grows strong enough, we can move to a higher ranked forest.”

The other teachers liked that idea and immediately incorporated it into their plans. They spent another five hours going over the finer details such as the reward system, food, shelter, weapons, and other details. 

It was also decided that they would need to scout out any forest before the students entered. After all, this was real life. Things changed all the time. It would be bad if all their promising students were wiped out because of a Rank 6 or Rank 7 beast moving into a Rank 3 hunting zone.

Because of that, Chu Shen, Lucas, and Su Gagi were chosen to scout out a Rank 3 magic beast hunting zone. They would return in a week with their report and then escort the kids to their new training camp. The reason Su Gagi was going along as well was because of the possibility of Chu Shen and Lucas disappearing. They chose Su Gagi simply because he was one of the only teachers they knew.

Chu Shen informed Lucas of their decision to scout the forest and their plans to train the kids. He didn’t like the idea of them killing beasts but decided it was okay so long as no one died. It had been decided that leaving as soon as possible was the best idea.

The next morning, they took the horses from the wagons and immediately set off to towards the magic beast hunting zone.













<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 121 - Scouting</h1>

Chu Shen, Lucas, and Su Gagi took two days to reach the magical beast hunting zone. Just like with the previous world, there was towns around each hunting zone. Chu Shen and co. went into the local town to check out the atmosphere and the resources the town had for sale.

They browsed a couple of shops to find out what was there. They also bought a couple tools such as axes, saws, and some other building materials. After they looked around town for two hours, they left for the hunting zone. Su Gagi told them his opinion of the town’s wares as they entered the forest.


“This place is a ripoff. The prices are 30% higher here than in any other place I’ve been. Not to mention the fact that the beast cores sell for 5% less as well.” He was obviously offended at the prices in the hunting town.

Chu Shen shrugged. “It’s not that big a deal. All we have to do is make a trip to get supplies from a different town. There’s one a day’s ride from the hunting zone. We can collect any supplies we need from there.”


Lucas nodded. “Chu Shen here is an artificer. If we can buy the supplies cheap and sell the artifacts here then we’ll definitely make a killing.”

Su Gagi looked confused. “What is an ‘artificer’? It sounds like an important job from your voice but I’ve never heard of it.”

Now it was Lucas’ turn to be confused. “Haven’t you heard of an artifact?”

Su Gagi shook his head. “No, I don’t know what an artifact is.”

Lucas sighed. “Well, artificers create artifacts. Artifacts are essentially weapons or armor that has inscriptions in them. The inscriptions give the item different effects like unleashing a blast of mana.

Su Gagi suddenly showed comprehension. “Ah, you mean you can create magic tools? No wonder you seemed  so protective of him, such a rare job to be a Magic Painter. It’s a pretty valuable occupation.”

Chu Shen, who had been listening in on the conversation, decided it was time to butt in. “Sorry for all of Lucas’ annoying chatter. We just called it a different name in our town. Artificers create the weapon from the ground up. We forge the blade and then put the magic paint on.”

Su Gagi was shocked at that. “You mean you actually make the tools yourself? I’ve never heard of a Magic Painter doing that. Most of them are stuck up snobs. That must explain why you’re so nice, you actually know about hard work.”


Chu Shen shrugged. “Well, by making the tool myself I can get a feel for the metal. Then I can make the best inscription for it. Altogether it’s much better than inscribing some random hunk of metal.”

Su Gagi shrugged. “I don’t know. It seems like you would know more about it than I do. All I can do is kill stuff and teach so I’ll leave the crafting part to you. Anyways, shouldn’t we be more focused on scouting the forest?”

“Oh please.” Lucas rolled his eyes. “I have a program running to identify threa-”

“Ahem” Chu Shen coughed lightly.

Lucas appeared suitably chastened after Chu Shen’s gentle reminder. “Uh, what I mean to say was that we should split up and cover at least ten miles of the hunting zone. We’re looking for any hazardous spots and especially dangerous magic beasts, right?”

Su Gagi nodded. “There shouldn’t be any since we checked the map in town but it is still a good idea to double check everything. This isn’t like buying a hat, there are people’s lives at stake”

“Alright, so we are agreed then? We split up and cover the hunting zone?” Chu Shen asked as the mediator. Everyone nodded in agreement. “Alright then. I’ll take the left, Lucas you take the middle, Su Gagi you take the right. Everyone good? Then let's get started.”

Everyone started off in their own directions. Chu Shen wasn’t too concerned with scouting out the hunting zone. To be honest, they didn’t even need to enter the forest at all. The reason was because of Lucas’ drones. Lucas loved modifying them and one of the mods was adding a scanner to each drone.

The drones had energy scanners, 3d mapping, cameras, and pattern recognition software that had been uploaded from different dictionaries and encyclopedias. As a result, them going into the forest was more like an excuse for Chu Shen to relax for a little while. 

Of course, there was also the additional reason for keeping Su Gagi in the dark about their capabilities. While Chu Shen was confident that Su Gagi and everyone else in their ragtag group wouldn’t betray them, it’s always better to be safe than sorry.

 By not having Su Gagi know about technology, he was kept safe from mentioning it on accident. Unlike a certain cyborg that keeps blurting things out. He was getting a headache just thinking about Lucas and his big mouth. Normally Lucas wasn’t so talkative but having someone new around seemed to stimulate his motormouth. Literally.

They only stopped scouting out the forest after four hours. With that it was getting close to night time. Chu Shen volunteered for the first watch while everyone else got into sleeping bags they had brought along. Every three hours the guard would wake one of the others up and have him take their place.

The next day, they went back into the forest and started scouting once again. They covered forty miles of forest that day which was half of the hunting zone. It turns out that since this was only a Rank 3 hunting zone, it was very big. The higher rank the hunting zone, the smaller it was.

The reason was that low rank magical beasts can breed a lot faster than high rank magical beasts. An example would be the Scorching Horned Rabbit. A single couple can make over 12 baby rabbits, all of which will be adults in less than two months. 

As a result, low rank magical beasts need a lot of space since they seem to constantly repopulate. Furthermore, high rank beasts need less space but these hunting zones have stricter policies than the low rank hunting zones. Strict laws to prevent overhunting were enforced in high rank hunting zones. It would be bad if all the animals were killed after all.

They scoured the forest for the rest of the day before they finally called it quits. The next day it was time for the final step. They needed to locate an area outside of the hunting zone that they could base the kids training camp out of. The requirements for it weren’t very strict.

They needed a large open area with running water by it. They also needed trees so they could have wood for the fire. It also needed to be far enough from the hunting zone that the beasts wouldn’t bother coming out to attack them.

Everyone started looking for such an area even though Lucas found one pretty quickly with his drones. Chu Shen subtly guided them to the area Lucas had found for Su Gagi’s sake. Upon reaching it, they took out the axes and cut down all of the trees surrounding the twenty foot diameter clearing, expanding it to 100 feet. They also destroyed the other foliage. Then they cut all the felled trees the same exact size..

After they were done cutting up the trees, they took out the saws they had bought earlier. Using the saws, they cut notches into the ends of the felled trees. Next they stacked the felled trees on top of one another, creating rudimentary square log cabins. Then they cut more wood the same length as the cabins to make a roof.

The ground was only dirt and there was obvious gaps between the tree trunks. Next they used wood chips mixed with mud from the river that went through the clearing  to fill the gaps. It was a crude solution but there wasn’t a better one for the time constraints they had.

With that, they had managed to build some roughshod houses for the kids. There was still some things they could do to make it better, making planks for a floor for one, but it was already getting dark. They had only accomplished this much in one day because of their cultivation. Everyone slept inside the cabins. The next day they left to head back to their camp.













<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 122 - Training Camp Rules</h1>

After Chu Shen, Su Gagi, and Lucas returned to the camp they were immediately surrounded by the teachers. “How is the forest?” “Will it work?” “Is my plan feasible?” Chu Shen and the others were immediately bombarded with questions upon their return.

Su Gagi immediately took the lead. “Hold on. Let us go in and sit down before we have to answer all these questions. It took us two days of riding to get here and I imagine we’re all sore.” The teachers backed off, though they still seemed eager to have their questions answered.

They went in and sat for a while. One of the teachers got them all some tea. Finally, one of them couldn’t take it anymore. “So, what did you find?” She asked eagerly. Everyone looked at her. “What, you were all thinking it. I just said it.” She said defensively.

Su Gagi smiled at everyone. “Well, it seems like it’s feasible. We already have some crude log cabins set up for everyone to move in. All we need to do is to get the kids together and move them. We checked out the hunting zone and there is plenty of beasts they can hunt and none that are out of the normal expected power levels.”

All of the teachers started grinning. “Well then, when should we move?” The female teacher asked. After that everyone started talking about specific and boring details. Chu Shen, who was tired from riding a horse all day, decided not to stay and to go to bed.

The next morning the kids were sat down and given a talking to by Su Gagi. “Listen, because what I tell you next is probably going to decide your future. I know most of you has lost someone to the Asura Sect. We”, he swept his hand behind him to include the other adults, Chu Shen, and Lucas, “have a way for you to get revenge on them.”

Upon hearing that, most of the kids perked up. Chrissa and Aslo were noticeably calmer about it though since they already knew they would have the power to get revenge soon.

“You must hear me out though.” Su Gagi  immediately tried to curb their excitement. “This training method will be tough and it can even be said to be cruel. Some of you might die. We plan to have you hunt magical beasts to train. Are you still willing?”

A couple of the kids were hesitant. Some were nervous. The vast majority seemed to still not get what hunting magical beast meant. Su Gagi understood that. “If you have any questions you can ask a teacher at anytime.

“We plan to leave to the hunting zone to train first thing tomorrow morning. If you don’t want to do this training then you can see one of the teachers and tell them. We won’t take you with us. Be warned though, once we arrive to start the training, you can’t change your mind.”

Immediately some of the kids faces paled. This new training regime sounded hard and possibly fatal. Some of the smarter ones thought they could try it out and then quit if they didn’t like it. With this new information, more than a few lost the courage they had mustered. Aslo, who had been watching from the back, rolled his eyes.

Standing up, he started to scold them. “How come you guys are all cowards? My mom was killed in front of me. Even if I might die, I still want to try and get revenge for her. If this new training can do it, then even if there is a chance of me dying, I would still do it. Can you all forget the faces of your parents when they died? Or the teachers when they died trying to save us?”

“Aslo, sit down!” Su Gagi yelled at him. “You go too far. Maybe you can call them cowards but whether they go or not is up to them. We cannot force them or even try to shame them into going.” He turned to the kids. “Well, you already heard everything you needed to hear. You’re dismissed. Remember, tell the teachers if you don’t wish to go. Otherwise, you will be coming with us tomorrow.”

Chu Shen could see the difference in the kids attitude as they left. Those kids who had been hesitating seemed as though they had made up their minds. Whichever way that was, Chu Shen didn’t know. He wasn’t a mind reader after all. Either way, it was good that they didn’t have doubts.

The next day everyone was packed up and ready to go. There was only a single child that didn’t want to go and she was only seven years old. It was understandable for someone so young to not want to fight to the death.

It was decided that she would be taken with them but a private cabin would be made for her and one of the teachers would watch her. She wouldn’t be forced to join. Altogether, there was now 80 kids and 9 teachers that would be going to train.

After hitching the horses to the wagons, everyone departed from Garson to the hunting zone. It took three days instead of two to arrive at the hunting zone. The reason for the slower travel was, of course, because the wagons were slower than horseback. 

They arrived at the log cabins in middle of the afternoon on the third day. The teachers quickly got to work upon arriving. They cut up a couple of trees into even planks. Using a glue they had bought at the hunting town, they put the planks into the cabins for a floor. Using scrapers they smoothed out the floor so as to keep the kids from getting splinters. All of the kids were sent to bed after that, using the blankets they brought along from Garson.

The teachers, along with Lucas and Chu Shen, continued working. They created a small cabin a little ways off for the little girl who didn’t want to train. They also created a large log cabin that was rectangular in shape. It was very long and not very wide. It was big enough that everyone could live inside it with some room to spare. After it was built, they joined the kids and slept.

The very next day, the kids were brought into the large cabin. There Chu Shen stood in front of them. “Hey kids. So today we are going to be starting the training. Before we do though, we should probably go over the rules first.

“So here they are. Rule 1. We will provide all your meals. The weapons, armor, and meals will all be very basic. Essentially there will be a biscuit and some vegetables for all your meals. 

“Rule 2. You must hunt in teams. For now the teams will be made up of five people with a teacher 

“Rule 2. If you want better food you must hunt it for yourself. Any meat from the beasts hunted will belong to the group that killed it. We will cook it for you.

“Rule 3. You can sell the beast core to the store to earn contribution points. Using the contribution points, you can buy spells, techniques, additional food, toys, weapons, armor, private lessons, or even have me open up additional mana rivers.

“Rule 4. If there has been no attempt to hunt for a beast for two weeks then there must be an explanation. If there is not an explanation, then all equipment except the ones originally provided will then be taken from the offender.

“Rule 5. Every week there will be a teaching and duel session. This week there will only be teaching with no hunting. This is so we can prepare the equipment you will all need for hunting. The teachers will use this room to teach you all a little bit more about your powers. Pay attention because what you learn here can affect your life outside. That’s all”

All of the kids seemed a bit confused. Su Gagi immediately took over and started teaching as Chu Shen left the room. He was waiting for materials needed to make the armor and weapons they were going to give the students. They had sent the teacher back to the town  With this last purchase their funds would be down to zero. 

It was time to start equipping these kids so they could learn how to fight.

 





















<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 123 - If Only I Weren’t Distracted</h1>

The next day, the kids were stuck in their temporary classrooms learning about classification of spell casting. Desks hadn’t been made yet but the teachers were well on their way to finishing yet. While that happened, the materials Chu Shen sent for had finally arrived.

Chu Shen wasn’t actually going to be making them though. That was Lucas’ job. Using the fabricator, Lucas was able to make standardized swords, spears, shields, and armor. The materials they had brought included black iron and leather, enough to finish all of the tools.

Chu Shen, however, was focused on making more money. In order to let the kids spend their contribution points, they needed more items at the store. Right now, they didn’t have any money to stock their store, not that they had the store built yet either.

His job was to use his artificing skills to make some weapons he could sell. Fortunately when they were in the previous dimension, Chu Shen had kept all of his forging tools in his spatial ring. His whetstone, fuller, anvil, tongs, inscription ink, and hammers. He also had the materials to forge six swords.The only thing he didn’t have was a forge. 

Without a forge, Chu Shen couldn’t heat up the metal to work with it. Luckily, Chu Shen had picked up a martial art that he could use in place of the forge. Remember when Chu Shen was forced to fight the pillar warriors for two weeks by Master Ti Wu in the Black Night Sect? Master Ti Wu only let Chu Shen go because he had managed to beat the seventh pillar.

Because of him being able to beat the seventh pillar, Chu Shen was able to receive a seventh martial art. The one he chose was <Stellar Flame>. It was one of the martial arts that Master Ti Wu had chosen for him when he first entered the Void Sect. It was a martial art that allowed one to use fire to burn their enemies. It was only suitable for those who used void, or null qi. 

One must remember that null and void Qi was a combination of everything in the universe and it’s opposites. It means that everything is contained inside null Qi. The <Stellar Flame> was a martial art that isolated the fire portion of void and null Qi. With that, Chu Shen could harness the power of the universe’s flames.

Even the most heaven defying flame belonged to the universe because it was the universe itself that birthed it. As for the void and null Qi that represented the universe? Of course it could recreate such terrifying flame. The only difference was that one needed sufficient strength to recreate such flames. 

Right now, with Chu Shen’s strength, he could only create flames that were suitable to forge. As for attack? Chu Shen hadn’t even started training <Stellar Flame>. He had been busy forging and cultivating in the previous dimension. Much too busy to practice the new martial art.

Him using <Stellar Flame> to forge was a win-win for all. It let Chu Shen forge the things he needed and allowed him to practice the martial art. The only one who didn’t like it was Master Ti Wu. 

As a matter of fact, he was actually enraged by it. ‘You brat! So disrespectful! Don’t you know that is one of the best martial arts in the library?! To think that you would use something that others would kill for to simply, simply….ARGH!’

‘To sully a martial art like this and use it forge! Where is it’s dominating image! Don’t you remember it’s introduction?! (Burn the universe to nothing. Incinerate your enemies and let nothing stand.). That was <Stellar Flames> introduction and yet you still seem to fancy using it as a fireplace!’

Chu Shen mentally shrugged. ‘I don’t see what the big deal is master. A martial art is supposed to be used however the user wants. If a martial art is used simply to fight, then don’t you think it’s beauty is lost? Maybe the creator of this martial art never intended it be used as a forge fire but it could also be true that he would be grateful that I am using it for creation and not just destruction.’

Master Ti Wu would have none of that. ‘Bah! Using honeyed words to try and coax me. You shameless disciple! Huff. You know what? I think you only picked that martial art because you needed a fire for your forge.’

Chu Shen eyes glanced away real quickly at that. ‘A-anyways master, I still need to forge these weapons so…..’

‘Of course. Forget about your master. Humph. I’ve never had such a disrespectful disciple. Go on then! Sully that martial art and get forging. I’m taking a nap!’ Master Ti Wu left in a huff. Or at least, he stopped talking to Chu Shen. 

Chu Shen decided to continue with his plan to forge. It was worth Master Ti Wu’s disapproval. He brought out his tools and started laying everything out. Setting up a small table he set his forging hammers and other hand tools on it. Placing the anvil beside the table, Chu Shen was ready to start forging. 

He brought out the black iron and placed it on the anvil. He backed up slightly and then pointed his palms at the material. He took a deep breath before activating the <Stellar Flame>. Qi flowed from his dantian and into his meridians.

 It flowed in a specific pattern inside his body, going into the chest before traveling into Chu Shen’s arms. If one could see his meridians, the Qi would form the image of a fire, forever frozen in time. The Qi surged forth from his arms before coalescing into his palms. There, the Qi emerged. Unlike all the other times before, it was not a gray color but rather a pure bright white.

Why was it white? Most people think of fire as red or orange colored. However, even a mortal knows that the hottest fire is not such colors but rather white. How could null Qi contain such awful fire? This white fire did not have any special properties and on Lucas’ world would have deemed such fire as actually being on the cool side. 

To a blacksmith however, this fire was the hottest one could have for mortal metals. If Lucas was struck with this fire, it would soften the Dragon Iron but wouldn’t melt it. From that it could be seen how tough Dragon Iron was but also how useless this fire was as well.

 For combat capabilities, this flame truly was useless in it’s current stage. However, Chu Shen had only just started to practice <Stellar Flame>. If he had some time to practice it, then it would soon become much stronger. This was his whole reason for practicing <Stellar Flame> by using it to forge.

The white Qi emerged from Chu Shen’s palms. When it did, the surrounding temperature immediately shot up by a few degrees. With a thought on Chu Shen’s part, the white Qi transformed into white fire and covered the black iron. As the black iron started to heat up, it turned a beautiful cherry red.

As soon as it reached this temperature, Chu Shen tried to stop the flame. It didn’t work. Panicking slightly, Chu Shen stopped circulating his Qi. When he did, the white flame was suddenly enveloped by gray colored energy that continued coming from his palms. The white flame disappeared without a trace as Chu Shen’s null Qi devoured it.

Chu Shen shrugged. Looks like he still needed to practice a bit more with <Stellar Flame: Flame Blower>. This was the first stage of <Stellar Flame> which required one to blow fire from their palms.

 There was stages to <Song of The Universe> as well. Chu Shen had completely mastered the first stage, <Song of The Universe: Celestial Weapon>. It was where one applied the vibrations to their weapon, like Chu Shen had with his hammer. Currently he was working on the second stage, <Song of The Universe: Solar Vibrations>, which was when one could send vibrations with their Qi, allowing their Qi to gain the quality of vibration. Chu Shen couldn’t even make his twitch so far but he had only recently gained mastery over the first stage.

He had also stepped into the 3rd stage of the <Void King: Bones of Null>. This stage was basically the tempering of one's bones where the previous two stages was the tempering of muscles and skin. Chu Shen still only 60.25 tons of force from the 30th circulation of the <Void King> technique. 

Remember, it might have seemed like a long time since coming to this world but it hadn’t even been a month yet. Chu Shen had been busy the entire time with research, hunting, or protecting the kids. He just hadn’t had a whole lot of time to actually cultivate.

Chu Shen had almost mastered the first stage of <Comet Travels Through: Booming Step> and <The Stars Dance: Light Step>. If Chu Shen actually mastered Booming Step then he would leave a sonic boom behind him when he used this technique. 

If Chu Shen mastered light step, he would be able to condense his Qi and appear to walk on light. With this his agility would soar since he would be able to travel in the air. Of course, the cost would be enormous amounts of Qi since he would have to condense it into thin, solid layers in midair.

This was the powers of martial arts. This was the reason why Master Ti Wu scoffed at those warriors when Chu Shen asked about their martial arts. Honestly, if Chu Shen wasn’t so distracted with forging and researching technology, he would be far stronger than he was now. The only thing holding him back was his constant curiosity about the things in new realms.

Chu Shen continued forging new blades. Only four swords were successfully made. The others were ruined by his learning experience with <Stellar Flame>. Upon forging them, Chu Shen went to the hunting town and sold them. Using the money he had the teacher go back for more materials. He repeated this for the rest of the week. After that, Chu Shen started to stock the store, which was now built, while the kids were equipped and sent hunting.



























<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 124 - A Kid’s Life</h1>

At the end of the week every student was assigned to a team and a teacher was also assigned to oversee the team. There was 16 teams of 5 students and 9 teachers. Because of this, every teacher had a second team they oversaw and the 4 extra teachers guarded the camp. The schedule was the teachers would take their first group into the forest one day and the their second group the next day once the hunting started.

Talia, Sam, George, Sarah, and Jason were all part of team 4. Assigned to oversee their team was Teacher Alfred. Alfred was also assigned to team 3. The schedule for when they started hunting was on Saturday there would be a required class. Sunday would be a resting day. Monday through Friday was the days to hunt.

Hunting wasn’t starting until two weeks from now though. First, everyone had to learn how to at least hold their weapon properly. Alfred took team 4 to the armory to pick weapons. Sam and Jason chose swords. George and Sarah picked spears. Talia chose a bow.

Alfred took them to the training zone the teachers had made while the students were in the classrooms. There, targets and dummies had been set up for training. The students were required to train while Alfred watched them.

Talia looked like she knew what she was doing. She strung the bow properly and had an armguard on. Her shooting was decent as well, only missing the target completely every twentieth shot. George swung his spear around pretty fluidly and was able to stab a vital spot like the heart or head every once in awhile. Everyone else was very nervous and awkward with the weapons they chose.

Alfred sighed. It seemed like he had his work cut out for him. For the entire week, Alfred taught the students how to thrust, parry, attack, counterattack, and dodge. He taught George and Sarah how to thrust forward with the spear and then swing the butt end of the spear to hit an opponent trying to close in on you. He didn’t have a whole lot to teach Talia. Instead he gave her advice on what kind of targets to aim for and what kind to avoid.

Next he taught everyone how to use spells. Talia, Jason, and Sam were all excellent at using magic. Sarah was moderately good but George wasn’t any good at all. George hadn’t been a mage until Chu Shen awoke him so it was to be expected. Talia and Jason had ice mana. Sam had lightning mana. George had earth mana and Sarah had darkness mana.

After that week of training, it was time to hunt. It went as expected, disastrously. The first magical beast they met was the Scorching Horned Rabbit, the same kind Chu Shen and Lucas had hunted in droves before. They were quite lucky since they were rare to meet if one didn’t cheat and use a tracking program.

The rabbit jumped out, taking Sam down instantly with a surprise attack in the form of a fireball to the back. Alfred sighed as he watched George try to stab the rabbit with his spear. The spear missed and stabbed into the ground as the rabbit jumped out of the way. A fireball was shot from it’s horn and into George, sending him flying back. He had some serious burns from the fire and collapsed where he landed, writhing in pain.

Ice shot towards the rabbit’s leg as it landed, trying to trap it. The ice hit the rabbit but the rabbit melted it in less than a second with a stream of fire from it’s horn. Jason tried to strike it with his sword while it was stuck but missed. An arrow shot past Jason, inches from his arm towards the rabbit before sticking into a tree. 

The rabbit shot towards Sarah horn first. Sarah panicked and tried to get her spear up. Unfortunately, the rabbit kicked off a tree, adjusting it’s flight by less than an inch. That inch was enough for the rabbit to skim past Sarah’s spear and stab it’s horn into her shoulder, piercing her armor. Crying out loud from the pain, Sarah let go of her spear and collapsed.

Talia held her bow nervously. She was afraid of accidentally striking her comrades after barely missing Jason. The rabbit came after her next. She drew her bow instantly. She aimed at the figure of the rabbit as it hopped towards her. Jason ran over to assist her. Talia fired her arrow. It missed.

The rabbit was now coming straight at her. The horn was pointed right at her chest. Jason dove forward, thrusting his sword at rabbit. He was too slow. The sword missed the rabbit by a foot. The rabbit continued it’s path towards Talia’s heart. Talia tried to react by swinging her bow at the rabbit. The bow was hit by a fireball and throw to the side as the rabbit continued straight at her heart.

Right as it was less an inch away, an earthen spear skewered the rabbit to a nearby tree. Alfred shook his head. Indeed these kids had a lot to learn. The next day, after Team 4 was re-equipped they were trained by one of the teachers that guarded the camp. Alfred couldn’t since he was taking Team 3 into the forest. All of them became extremely earnest in their learning after Talia had almost died.

It took many tries over the rest of the month but eventually they managed to kill their first Rank 2 magical beast. They sold it’s core to the store while they had their first meal in over two weeks that didn’t consist of dry biscuits and hard meat. 

By the end of the month, Team 4 had killed eight Rank 2 magical beasts and two Rank 3 magical beasts. Using the money earned over that period they were able to buy spells, techniques, and upgrade their gear. 

George still had his original spear but now he also had a shield with a [Channelling Inscription]. Imbuing his earth mana into the shield allowed it to become covered in earthen spikes. With his control over his mana, George could also launch the spikes like projectiles.

Talia now had her arrows with a [Storing Inscription] which allowed her to store her mana inside the arrows. Her ice attribute would inevitably slow down their opponent, making them easy prey. She also had a short sword as well with no additional inscriptions in case her opponent got too close.

Sam had two short swords with the [Burst Inscription] which allowed him to fire bursts of lightning at his opponents. His lightning mana allowed him to move and react extremely fast, making his choice to become a dual wielder an excellent one.

Jason had actually not changed at all, keeping his original sword. Instead he used his ice magic to attack his opponents. His skills with it had become increasingly refined, surpassing everyone else. The others did become better but most of them had increased their physical prowess. 

Most didn’t focus as much on magic as Jason had. In his opinion, a physical body couldn’t travel as fast as a spell. The image of him failing to stop the Scorching Horned Rabbit from hitting Talia and then the earth shard killing it at the last second was seared into his mind. That was the reason he focused more on spellcasting then utilizing his warrior capabilities. 

Sarah was the most mystical of the group. She was now equipped with multiple throwing knives, a dagger, and a crossbow mounted to her arm. Using her darkness mana she cloaked herself in shadows. The only magic she learned was called shadow cloaking, the ability to become invisible by melding with shadows. So long as she stayed in the shadows, no one above her in Rank could see her.

Using this ability, she became the scout of the group. In a fight crossbow bolts or daggers could be seen coming from the shadows themselves. It was almost impossible to dodge them. Of course, her ability to meld into shadows was of no use against Chu Shen’s spiritual sense.

After the first month, Alfred no longer went out on their expeditions with them. In his words, they were strong enough to not have to depend on him to save them. Instead they were given bracelets on each of their arm. 

The bracelets were made of steel and had a black square on the front. They were instructed to tap on them three times if they were in danger of dying and one of the teachers would be there shortly. This was, of course, an invention by Lucas. It would broadcast a homing beacon once activated that Lucas could then track down.

There was always a teacher on rescue duty who had a tracker. Once there was an alert, that teacher would go out and rescue the students while another teacher took over their job since there could be multiple calls.

On the third month their Saturdays were taken over by sparring. There was a competition every Saturday in which all of the teams would face off in a bracket style competition. Whoever won would get a set amount of contribution points as a prize.

At the start of the fourth month, they destroyed their camp site and moved to a Rank 4 and Rank 5 hunting zone. It was a necessity as most of the students were now Rank 4 mages and there was a few that were Rank 4 warriors. Most of them were only Rank 2 warriors. This kind of power level was simply too much for that Rank 3 hunting zone to pose a challenge. 

This training continued for a whole year. At the end of the twelfth month the students had graduated to a Rank 6 hunting zone. This was the highest rank hunting zone possible and they were only allowed to hunt three times a month. They had already been there for three months. Most of their other time was spent cultivating their warrior capabilities or sparring., 

As for their strength…. there was now 2 Rank 3 Warriors, 72 Rank 4 Warriors, 5 Rank 5 Warriors, and a single Rank 6 Warrior. Remember though, every single student was a battle mage, being both a warrior and a mage. 

There was 4 Rank 5 Mages, 41 Rank 6 Mages, 33 Rank 7 Mages and two Rank 8 Mages. Those two Rank 8 Mages were, of course, Chrissa and Aslo. After all, they already had a headstart on everyone else. As for the teachers, all of them had become Rank 8 Battle mages, meaning they were a Rank 8 mage and warrior simultaneously.

These kids were no longer innocent and weak, hesitating or scared. They had scars from their fights with beasts, giving them a fierce aura. Their attitudes had changed. It had changed into the kind of attitude one gained from war. This attitude contrasted sharply with their scarred, youthful faces. It was definitely weird but no one who saw how powerful they were would ever mock them for being such.

Finally, it was time to destroy those malevolent sects.











<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 125 - I’m Training Too!</h1>

While the kids had definitely been training, it was Chu Shen’s turn as well. Master Ti Wu finally had some time to whip Chu Shen into shape without him being distracted by learning technology or practicing forging.

Chu Shen spent the first month practicing the <Stellar Flame> by forging the items to sell at the store. Lucas took over selling items to the hunting store since the fabber could create weapons with inscriptions. 

All he needed was Chu Shen to demonstrate an inscription once and for him to be given the necessary materials. If all that was accomplished, then Lucas could make an infinite amount of weapons exactly alike in every way. That was the power of industrialization.

Chu Shen was able to master the first stage of <Stellar Flame: Flame Blower>  and move onto the second stage, <Stellar Flame: Flame Body>. This was when one was able to emit flames from any part of their body. Chu Shen was able to do so, though it was tricky trying to heat up ore with your spine.

Chu Shen spent the other 11 months cultivating and whole heartedly training his martial arts to the new stage. Chu Shen was able to completely master the second stages for all of his martial arts in this time. He was able to start on the third stage for them but wasn’t able to actually master it, making him only capable of using the second stage for now. As a matter of fact, the movement technique <Comet Travels Through> only had three stages.

Here is a list and description of all the different advancements Chu Shen made with his martial arts.

<Stellar Flame: Flame Blower> (One can shoot streams of fire from their palms), <Stellar Flame: Flame Body> (One can emit fire from any part of their body), <Stellar Flame: Sun Formation> (One forms a miniature Sun with fire).

<Comet Travels Through: Booming Step> (One breaks the sound barrier creating a sonic boom), <Comet Travels Through: Dust Trail> (Dust can be raised from one's passage even over solid rock), <Comet Travels Through: Vapor Trail> (One moves so fast that vapor forms behind them from atmospheric water evaporating).

<Song of the Universe: Celestial Weapon> (One can vibrate their weapon and pass through body shields) <Song of the Universe: Solar Vibrations> (One can vibrate their Qi and cause internal damage), <Song of the Universe: Void Vibrations> (One can cause the air itself to vibrate, turning it into a devastating weapon).

<Stars Dance: Light Step> (One can solidify their Qi beneath their feet and create a step in midair), <Stars Dance: Stars Light> (One can create a bright flash of light and blind their opponent), <Stars Dance: Celestial Twin> (One can create a reflection of themselves off their Qi). 

<Cancellation Armor: Phantom> (One can create a translucent appearance of armor around themselves. Amplifies nullification abilities), <Cancellation Armor: Manifest> (One can create armor that looks completely real. Amplifies nullification abilities), <Cancellation Armor: Reality> (One can create armor out of Qi that exists in reality. Enhances nullification abilities). <Universe Shield: Phantom>, <Universe Shield: Manifest>, <Universe Shield: Reality>. Other than one being a shield and the other armor, there was no difference in these martial art techniques stages.

As for cultivation. <Voids Child> had one stage called the <Voids Child: Mortal Stage>. This would last all the way until one could become a Natural Realm Cultivator. It was impossible for Chu Shen to master the first stage of his cultivation technique right now.

Chu Shen not only practiced his martial arts, he also cultivated as well. Since the kids were constantly hunting magical beasts, beast cores were plenty. Chu Shen actually took half of them for his cultivation and the rest were sold in town. Chu Shen had used hundreds of beast cores to rapidly his cultivation in the past year.

No longer was he a Martial Practitioner Level 9, or a Peak Rank 3 mage. Instead he was a Rank Martial Army Level 2, the equivalent of a Rank 6 mage. Chu Shen also became a Rank 4 warrior during this time, which delighted Master Ti Wu to no end. Don’t forget his Void King technique though.

<Void King: Skin Forging> (One can harden their skin and make it as hard as iron), <Void King: Muscle Tempering> (One’s muscles are tempered, increasing their strength tremendously), <Void King: Bones of Null> (One’s bones become soaked in null Qi and making them tremendously durable). 

Chu Shen previously completed 30 circulations. Now he can complete 39 circulations, one circulation away from mastering the 3rd stage of the Void King technique. His strength had also grown tremendously. His strength was now 538 tons of force, incomparable to his previous 60.25 tons. A normal martial artist would only have 290 so Chu Shen had almost double the strength of a normal martial artist.

Not only that, Chu Shen was able to use his money to upgrade his hammer and crossbow’s living steel with different materials. They were now comparable to a High-Tier Martial Weapon, greatly suiting Chu Shen’s current combat capabilities.

Chu Shen was not the only one upgrading things though. Lucas had been a very busy boy indeed. Lucas was able to make a pocket dimension. They had such devices on his own world but they need a massive amount of power to open first and stabilize. After they were stabilized, they didn’t require any power to sustain.

Lucas first made a fusion bottle. A fusion bottle uses magnetic fields and plasma to generate massive amounts of power with no by-products. The downside? The thing was the size of a room. It wasn’t exactly portable. Using the fusion bottle, Lucas was able to power the spatial creation device. 

It used tachyons to open up a rift in subspace and then stabilize this rift. Afterwards one could access it with a teleporter tuned to the right frequency which was actually quite power efficient. The size of this subspace was fifteen football fields wide and could be made bigger if there was more power.

To some that might not be significant. To Lucas, this was everything. Now he could create some very highly technical items while not having to worry about hiding it from everyone. The first thing Lucas made was a teleporter inside the sub-space. He already had one so that he could access the subspace from normal space but it was as big as a house so it was more convenient to have one in subspace.

With the teleporter, Lucas could teleport anything with a Quantum Transponder whether it was in normal space or subspace. Lucas then used the fabricator to construct a cradle free fabricator. This kind of fabricator could construct items with no size limit because it didn’t have to hold the object internally and could create it on the ground in front of it. 

One might ask by this point, how did Lucas get these materials? Well, Lucas had actually planned everything out beforehand. Using the fusion bottle, Lucas was able to boost the range on his mineral scanner. As a result, Lucas was able to find a lot more key materials for his inventions. All he had to do was go out and mine them. 

Lucas was able to create a couple things with the cradle free fabricator. For one, he created multiple versions of his body and then left his positronic brain inside the subspace. The subspace controller was inside his main body that he had been using since coming to this realm. With the Quantum comms and transponders, Lucas controlling his body from light years away was a cinch.

Lucas started making pretty much anything that came to mind. Satellites for orbital mapping, tracking, and bombardment were teleported into space. He created a small spaceship but never actually launched it. Turrets hooked up with beast cores were made but never used. Lucas placed positronic brains inside every copy of him and then loaded automating programs on them.

He built an antimatter generator as well which took up over two football fields inside the pocket dimension. Using quantum entanglement, Lucas was able to use the generator to power all of his replacement bodies at once. The antimatter created power far beyond that which his current body could handle. The most he could handle was the equivalent of a Rank 7 beast core. With that, his fake body could use 301 tons.

Lucas’ pride though was the Beast Cannon. Lucas bought sixty Rank 4 beast cores using the money from the weapons he made with the fabricator. There was 20 fire, 20 wind, and 20 earth type cores. He put them inside a cannon and used the [Channelling Inscription] and [Burst Inscription] to combine them all together. Once he fired the cannon, a beam of fire, wind, and rock would be launched at the enemy. It was terrifyingly strong.

So far Lucas and Chu Shen were lucky they weren’t forced to leave by the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. It was time to stop tempting luck and finish their mission here.


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 126 - Preparation</h1>

Before everyone left for White Lotus city, Chu Shen got a message from Master Ti Wu. ‘Hey brat.’

‘Yes Master Ti Wu?

‘Remember how I said that I could probably change one of their souls to gain soul sense?’

‘Yes.’

‘Well I think I can do it now. I can change it now and give them a technique that can allow them to change other people.’

Chu Shen immediately became elated. ‘Great, so how do we do it?’

‘We? There is now we. I’ll be doing all the work. All you have to do is find the right guy for me to change.’

Chu Shen paused at that. Who did he want to help? No, it wasn’t a question of who did he want to help but he did he think could be trusted? What he envisioned for this was that the person who had their soul changed would be able to help open other people’s meridians just like he was doing now. 

Such a power was dangerous in the wrong hands since one could create an army very easily in this world. Kind of like what Chu Shen was doing now. It was just too dangerous to give to everyone. It would be better to give it to only one person and only allow them to pass it down to only one person as well.

Chu Shen hadn’t actually thought of all this though. It was Master Ti Wu who had explained all this to him before. With what Master Ti Wu had said, Chu Shen realized he couldn’t be casual in selecting someone to pass it down to. Eventually Chu Shen realized it had to be a teacher. The kids were just too immature at this point to trust with something this big.

Chu Shen thought pretty hard on this and consulted with Lucas and Master Ti Wu before eventually settling on the teacher Lidia. She was a very kind and caring teacher. She was the one that looked after the little girl that didn’t want to train. That little girl had practically became Lidia’s daughter.

Lidia was not the leader of the group, Griffith was. Griffith was someone that was very respected. He was a good speaker, listener, confident, and respected everyone. Lidia was the one that was his advisor. It was Griffith that proposed the idea to train the kids at the hunting zones. Everyone asked his opinion after that and eventually he became the focus of the group. When it came time to chose a leader (Chu Shen and Lucas were exempt from this), it was Griffith that won their vote.

Griffith would probably make a good choice for the soul modification. Unfortunately, he was too public. Lidia was more behind the scenes. With that, there would be less chance of her getting kidnapped or assassinated. Finally, Chu Shen decided on Lidia.

Chu Shen approached Lidia about giving her the ability to increase a mages rank. Immediately she became excited. Such an ability was simply too mystical. Who wouldn’t want it? Lidia agreed to it.

“So what do I need to do to gain this ability?” Lidia asked questioningly. She looked to be in her mid-40’s if she was a mortal. She probably still had another two hundred years left since she was a Rank 8 mage.

Chu Shen started to answer before hesitating. ‘Uh, Master Ti Wu. What does she have to do?’

Master Ti Wu sighed. ‘She has to endure some pain. Besides that, nothing else.’

 Chu Shen turned back to Lidia who was still waiting for an answer. “Well Lidia, I’m afraid it’s going to be painful. Other than that, there shouldn’t be an issue.”

Lidia sighed in relief. “Good. If there was a chance of dying I’m afraid I would have had to refuse. I don’t want Clementine to have to go through the pain of losing a family member again.”

Chu Shen nodded. “Don’t worry. Everyone is so strong, I’m sure nothing can stop them. After you receive the ability to change one’s talent, we’ll be moving to destroy those sects still in White Lotus City.”

Lidia smiled. “Good. Well, we are only killing the sect members right?”

Chu Shen nodded. “These kids have experienced the pain of losing someone. I am sure that none of them actually want someone else to experience that. They’ve been having group exercises to train them for war and had a good talking to by Su Gagi. It’s been drilled into them pretty hard that we are trying to destroy the sects and not the people. Anyways, we should get started with the whole ability thing.” 

“Yes let's.” Lidia immediately became excited.

“Alright go ahead and sit down.” Chu Shen motioned at the chair right in front of him. Right now they were in Lidia’s cabin sitting at her table with Lidia sitting across from him. Lidia came to the other side of table and sat in the chair he had pointed to.

‘Master Ti Wu, it’s time.’

‘I know that brat.’ Master Ti Wu sounded a bit grumpy. His soul form came out. A bluish green energy formed on his hands. It was his spiritual Qi. The Qi floated out of Master Ti Wu’s hand to form a circle with complex writings and symbols inside it. Master Ti Wu pointed at Lidia and immediately the bluish green energy flew towards her.

It went straight into Lidia’s forehead, completely passing through her skin like a ghost. For a second nothing happened. Then bluish green lines appeared all over Lidia’s face. “AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!! AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!” When the lines appeared, Lidia’s face immediately twisted up in agony.

Master Ti Wu’s face was wrinkled in concentration. ‘Brat! Tell her to stop resisting and accept the change! If she cannot, she might die!’

Immediately Chu Shen followed his advice. He grabbed Lidia’s shoulder and squeezed it hard enough that red marks appeared. “LIDIA! STOP RESISTING! IF YOU CAN’T THEN YOU MIGHT DIE!”

“UUUUGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!! ARRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!” Lidia howled with agony. Then suddenly, she went limp. Concerned, Chu Shen looked at Master Ti Wu. He looked exhausted.

Master Ti Wu still had enough energy to talk though. “Don’t worry brat, she can’t hear us now. Currently her soul is going through a metamorphosis caused by my soul imprint. She’ll be fine.

“I also gave her the art to copy my soul imprint down a little bit at a time so there won’t be as much pain for the next person, more like an itch than being skinned alive. With this she can pass it down to one more person over a period a year. If that person has a bad personality she can destroy the partial imprint with a thought. There can only be two full imprints at any given time and only the full imprint can allow a soul to gain soul sense.”

Chu Shen nodded. “As expected of Master Ti Wu. You are quite thorough.”

Master Ti Wu puffed up a bit. “Of course. How could an elder of the Void Sect not be thorough? Anyways, you should probably go lay her down on the bed.”

Chu Shen obeyed and then left to find Lucas. 


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 127 - Too Early</h1>

Chu Shen found Lucas after he left Lidia in her room. They had some small talk and they even went inside Lucas’ pocket dimension to look around. Chu Shen had been so busy because of Master Ti Wu’s grueling training that he hadn’t had the time to talk to Lucas. He marveled at how much Lucas had gotten done.

“So Lucas, did you really manage to build all this?” Chu Shen marveled at the fusion bottle as the sound of plasma crackling came from it.

Lucas did a pose. “Of course I did. Otherwise, wouldn’t others call me simply a useless sidekick?”

Chu Shen looked confused. “Who would call you that?”

“All the teachers.”

“Oh, yeah. I forgot about that, mister bodyguard.”

“.....Mention it again, and I’m teleporting you to the moon.”

“Sheesh. Anyways Lucas, how did you even get the materials? It seems like you built a lot of things that require some pretty rare stuff.” Chu Shen pointed at the laser cannon in the background.

Lucas shrugged. “The cradle-free fabricator really helped as far as making the bigger things. To be honest though, the real credit goes to the ARD.”

“What’s the ARD?” Chu Shen was confused at this.

Lucas immediately pounced on the opportunity to show off. “A.R.D. stands for Atomic Reassembling Device. Essentially it’s a device that can deconstruct items at it’s atomic level and then reassemble them in any form. For example, taking graphite and turning it into diamonds. All it requires is reassembling the way the carbon atoms are bonded to each other.

“Reassembling items like that is it’s most basic form. What it really does is it can rearrange the electrons, protons, and neutrons inside the atom’s nucleus and electron cloud. By adding more of these subatomic particles to oxygen, one can turn pure Oxygen into pure iron. Of course, a room full of oxygen would only turn into a fistful of iron because of how much denser it is.

“There was a lot of rare materials that I had to find before I could even get started with making it. I spent three months just trying to track them all down. After that, I was able to make a ton of stuff without having to leave the dimension. Though I did have to go out every once in awhile and dig up mountains of dirt so that the ARD could transmute them.”

Lucas adopted a pained look at this point. “The only downside is the massive amount of power it drains to do something like that. It’s the reason that I had to make the antimatter generator. Otherwise I would have to use over a hundred Rank 7 beast cores just to power the thing.”

Chu Shen froze. One….. hundred. One hundred. One hundred beast cores!!!! Even if they were Rank 2 beast cores that was an insane amount! Lucas wasn’t talking about such low rank cores but Rank 7 cores?!!!! THIS WAS OUTRAGEOUS! It was like saying ‘I need all of the energy from one hundred Martial Kings’, all of which was needed to power one device!

Lucas saw Chu Shen’s shocked look and rolled his eyes. “Honestly Chu Shen, you should know how much energy is needed to split atoms into their subatomic particles and then fuse them to create the atom needed. Most of the energy goes towards containment. I have to be able to contain the energy of several hundred nuclear bombs inside the ARD from splitting the atoms and then harness that energy to fuse them together. Since some of the energy is lost in the transfer I also have to supply that energy.”

Chu Shen smiled. “You know, I remembered that we really are nerds. Wanna talk about hyperphysics calculations again?”

Lucas smiled back. “Nah. How about we just talk about the calculations I had to do in order to get all this together.”

“Sure. Let’s just get back to the kids first.”

“Honestly, you should stop calling them kids. They’re far more mature than most adults at this point.”

Chu Shen shrugged. “They’re all still five foot at the most. I just can’t help calling them kids even if they do have scars over their faces.”

Lucas shook his head sadly. “It is unfortunate that they had to deal with wild animals day in and day out for so long. Those scars are what made them who they are today though. They’ll soon be able to live without the threat of being killed and will be able to establish the Void Sect, just like they promised.”

Chu Shen and Lucas had approached the teachers soon after they started training at the hunting zone. Chu Shen had asked them to rename the Rising Tide Sect to Void Sect. They happily agreed saying that it was only thanks to Chu Shen that they were able to surpass their former glory. To them it was the representation of a new start, a new age for the Rising Tide, no. A new age for the Void Sect.

Chu Shen smiled. “Yeah, Master Ti Wu should be happy about that.”

Lucas shrugged. “I still think you’re crazy, talking to a ghost.”

Master Ti Wu appeared in his soul form. “What ghost! I’m still alive you brat!” Lucas didn’t respond. Unfortunately, Lucas couldn’t see Master Ti Wu. A soul form can only be perceived by another soul. Lucas didn’t have a soul, or at least, not a soul in the form martial artists knew of. As a result, he couldn’t see Master Ti Wu. As for hearing….. Lucas was just being a jerk.

Currently they were inside a small house Lucas had built after coming out from his pocket dimension. A knock came from the front door. Chu Shen looked over curiously while Lucas didn’t seem surprised at all. His sensors had detected their visitor for some time now.

Chu Shen got up and answered the door. It was Griffith. He bowed to Chu Shen. “Savior, it’s time for us to leave. The army is ready. Everyone has horses like you asked and we are ready to destroy all the cabins.”

Chu Shen and Lucas exchanged a glance. They were ready as well. “Thank you Griffith. We’ll go ahead and join you in a second.” He started to close the door before suddenly turning back to Griffith. “Is Lidia ready to go as well?”

Griffith nodded. “She seems to have a headache but is okay other than that. I heard that you gave her something to cause it?”

Chu Shen nodded. “Yes but it is a private affair between me and her. She will share it when she feels ready. Goodbye Griffith.”

He closed the door and turned to Lucas. “So you ready to go?”

Lucas nodded. “Everything’s already in my pocket dimension. I can teleport the satellites and other….equipment into it anytime I want.”

Chu Shen smiled. “Good, let’s go.”

Chu Shen and Lucas left with Griffith and the others. They rode at the front, to scout out what was ahead. The others didn’t like putting their saviors in such a dangerous position but they managed to get over it. It took a long time, two weeks actually, to get close to White Lotus City.

They were ten minutes away from the White Lotus City when they stopped. They started getting prepared to fight. Chu Shen had spent the last month forging  hand crafted items for each and every student in his downtime. Unlike before, they didn’t have to pay. He had decided that equipping the students was a good thing and he had the money to spare on materials.

He wanted the kids to be as prepared as possible and this was one of the only ways he knew how. Chu Shen and Lucas were off the side a bit, talking about where to position the drones. They were just finalizing their plans when a translucent barrier appeared around Chu Shen. 

He turned and saw Lucas was also covered in the same barrier. Chu Shen instantly recognized what was happening. The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion was leaving. 

Chu Shen yelled out the door. “GRIFFITH, WE’RE LEAVING! WE LEAVE THE DUTY OF TAKING REVENGE TO YOU!” It would be rude to leave them hanging or have them search everywhere for Chu Shen and Lucas when they would be in a completely different dimension.

Lucas was frantically teleporting all of his work into the pocket dimension. Luckily he already had a program worked out and in less than two seconds everything was secured. 

Just like they had appeared, Chu Shen and Lucas vanished into thin air.


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 128 - Revenge</h1>

Griffith heard Chu Shen yelling. Immediately he started running towards the savior’s voice. Upon arriving he saw their horses but neither of the saviors were there. The words the savior had been shouting finally registered with Griffith. He turned towards their horses and kowtowed. “I will not disappoint you saviors! We will get our revenge!”

Griffith collected the horses the saviors left behind and then turned back towards his group. Everyone was strapping on gear, eating a quick snack, or chatting with their comrades. They were getting ready for war. 

Griffith let go of the two horses and faced his soldiers. “Everyone, can I have your attention!” Immediately faces swiveled towards Griffith.

“The two saviors have left us!” Immediately there was some concern on everyone’s faces. Why would their saviors leave them now? “They have told us before that they may leave at any time. They left now with barely a warning. Where they have gone, I do not know.

“I can say this though! I am glad they have left now.” That shocked everyone. “This is a private affair! We have come to get revenge for our loved ones that were slain! The saviors gave us this chance! But I do not wish for them to see such violence! Remember what they asked us though, take pity on them! Kill only those that you saw killing! Everyone else, is to be spared! Now, mount up! We leave in five minutes!”

Everyone immediately became busy, throwing their food on the ground and helping their comrades finish putting on their armor. Five minutes later, everyone was ready.

……………………………………………………………………

Talgin leaned back in his chair and sighed. So many things were going wrong. He, the leader of the Golden Palm Sect, was about to lose his Sect. He had worked together with the Asura and Ice Dragon Sect to destroy the Rising Tide Sect.  He had never liked conflict but those kids….. They would have ruined everything if they had a chance to grow.

Back then, he had been forced to take action. It seemed like it was all in vain though. The Asura Sect had been growing more powerful with each day. Their training methods were cruel and inhumane. They found that if the body was conditioned for extreme pain, then the chances of becoming a high ranking warrior was practically guaranteed. 

They had learned this method three years ago and the results were finally starting to show. Very quickly, high ranking assassins started to appear in the Asura’s ranks. The Ice Dragon Sect had realized this and immediately decided to go with the flow. They became a partner with the Asura Sect. The Ice Dragon Sect was filled mages and filled the gap of the Asura Sect by being able to provide long range support. 

The Golden Palm Sect was a combination of warrior and mage adventurers. They were one of the strongest powers in White Lotus City, second only to the Rising Tide Sect. With the Rising Tide Sect gone they were the strongest power. 

Unfortunately, the Asura and White Dragon Sect, when combined, were just as powerful. With the rise of the Asura Sect’s strength, they eventually became outmatched. The Asura Sect had been taking little chunks off the Golden Palm Sect and it was slowly killing them. Currently they only had half the resources they had before.  Talgin sighed. ‘Will I really have to join them? I don’t want to, the Asura Sect is only filled with murderers. Unfortunately, if I don’t then we’ll be the next Rising Tide Sect.’

BOOOOMMMMMM

Talgin stiffened. Was it the Asura Sect?! Did they really wish to fight with them now!? If they did, they would have to suffer major casualties. Would they really do that?! As if in answer, more explosions came from outside. 

BOOOOMMM BOOOOMMMM BOOOMMMM

Talgin immediately cleared his head. Either way, whether it was the Asura Sect or not, they were under attack. He rushed towards a cabinet on his right. In less than ten seconds he was clothed in armor. A spear was cradled in his right arm and a sword was strapped to his back. Several knife handles could be seen sticking out of places in his armor. This was the speed of a Rank 5 warrior.

Talgin wasn’t a frontline warrior. They had three Rank 6 mages but two had faked their deaths. The leaders of the other sects knew about them though the public was kept in the dark. A powerful surge of mana notified Talgin that their Rank 6 mage was going into battle.

Quickly, Talgin started running towards the explosions he had heard. He flung open a door and appeared on a balcony on the second story. He stopped, frozen by the scene below him.

“What is this?!”

…………………………………………………………………….

Team 4 stood outside the Golden Palm Sect, hands on their weapons. They, along with Teams 9 and 11 would be in charge of destroying the Golden Palm Sect. The actual plan was to force the Golden Palm sect into surrendering. Then the people who surrendered would be brought into the main square. Similar plans for the Asura and Ice Dragon Sect were being carried out.

After everyone was in the square, members of the sects that had killed someone from the Rising Tide Sect would be executed. Everyone else would be set free, regardless of their strength. After all, even if a Rank 8 adventurer attacked them, they already had 2 Rank 8 mages. They would simply be courting death to attack the Void Sect again.

George and Sam started first. George cast the Rank 4 spell <Earth Eruption> while Sam cast the Rank 6 spell <Lightning Storm>. The earth seemed to explode in a giant circle around the entire Golden Palm Sect, forming a forty foot deep and twenty foot wide trench. Large explosions went off as Lightning continuously struck the ground just beyond the trench George had made.

The guards trembled at the power being displayed in front of them. Numerous students and guards ran from their residents in the sect only to stare slack jawed at the lightning surging down from the sky. It looked like an angry thunder god was striking them down.

A man in golden robes strolled out from the sect. The teams were spaced out evenly around the entire sect. The man frowned. “What is the meaning of this?! Asura Sect, Ice Dragon Sect! Are you trying to confuse us by sending kids while launching spells from a distance!”

One of the kids stepped forwards. It was one from Team 9 with the wind attribute. Using the Rank 1 spell of Voice Projection, everyone in the Golden Palm Sect could clearly hear his voice.

“We are students of the former Raging Tide Sect. There are nine Rank 7 Mages here and six Rank 6 Mages as well. We would like for you to peacefully surrender. If you do not and try to flee or fight the penalty will be…... DEATH!” 

Upon the word death being uttered, a chilly aura seemed to encompass the entire sect. The teams of kids did not flinch at the word and instead stared coldly at the enemies. The only thing that could soften their hardened hearts was the scared young faces of the students from the Golden Palm Sect. If not for that, it was quite possible they would have disregarded the savior’s plea for the innocent. 

The golden robed man seemed shocked before suddenly laughing uproariously. “You, you really think that I would believe that you brats could suddenly become so powerful!? This is the first time in my hundred years of life that I have been threatened by a group of brats.”

None of the kids spoke. Instead they stood there, staring at the man. He smirked before uttering two words. “Golden Wall.” Immediately a large barrier appeared around the entire sect. The barrier was gold and was incomparably thick. A Rank 6 magic that was cast instantly. It seemed as though this golden robed man was truly skilled.

The golden robed man, now that he was hidden from view, no longer looked so confident. He turned and looked upwards at Talgin. “Master, what do we do! I don’t believe those brats are as strong as they say but whoever is backing them up is truly powerful. Those lightning strikes are on par with my <Gold Shower>. At the very least they are a Rank 6 mage.”

Talgin, who had been stunned by the lightning surrounding them, came to his senses. “I don’t know. This could very well be a ploy by the Asura Sect. Baldwin, you need to be careful. Take Galgor and Waldo with you to clear a route underground. With their earth magic it should be easy to make a tunnel for the kids to escape. Us teachers will stay here and defend them.”

Baldwin nodded. “Yes master I wi-”

He was suddenly cut off as a black coffin materialized around him, cutting Baldwin off from the rest of the world. A young girl appeared out of the shadows with a crossbow mounted on her arm. She pointed her crossbow at Talgin.

 “Order the surrender or this man dies.”



<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 129 - Conflict Closing</h1>

It was a very sad day for the Asura Sect. Indeed, the Void Sect had surrounded them. How unfortunate that they were now so arrogant since they had become one of the power houses of White Lotus City. They refused to believe that it was the Void Sect. They laughed and mocked the kids for trying to act tough. 

All of them gathered together to slaughter the insignificant brats that dared to hold them hostage. Their bloodthirsty nature showed as they used their most ruthless attacks on the kids, not showing even a hint of mercy towards their young age. They used their own students as cannon fodder in their fights. 

How sad, how truly unfortunate for them. For showing such ruthless nature took the students of the Void Sect back to the days of slaughter. To the day when their families, teachers, and friends were killed by these fiends. Not even ten minutes after they attacked, they were destroyed. 

The Asura Sect….. was no more.

As for the Ice Dragon Sect, they were more hesitant and believing than the Asura Sect. Upon hearing their demands, as well as their claims that they were Rank 6 and Rank 7 mages, they were loath to believe it. But what if it was true? As a test, their Rank 6 mage asked for a duel. Immediately, over ten Rank 6 spells flew at him from different places. After seeing that, the Ice Dragon Sect gave up. 

While all this was going on, Sarah was still facing down the Golden Palm Sect.

………………………………………………………………………………

Talgin was stunned by this sudden occurrence. The powerhouse of his sect was trapped inside the <Shadow Coffin> technique. A Rank 6 magic that would cause anyone to panic. What was worse was the fact that it appeared to be a little girl that had cast it. This completely overturned his sense of power. Yes, a little girl could theoretically become a Rank 6 mage. However, who would ever suspect that someone so young could be so powerful?

Usually, students were advised to stay at Rank 2 or Rank 3 in order to gain experience. It was similar to what Chu Shen was doing, actually. So when this little girl was suddenly revealed to actually be a Rank 6 mage….. it threw Talgin for a loop.

“W-w-what!?” He stuttered, pointing at Sarah.

She sighed. “Obviously if you don’t order a surrender, I will have to kill this man. Next I will have to kill you. After that, if no one surrenders,  we will have to start killing people at random.”

Talgin immediately paled. There was more than ten other kids the same age as this little girl outside the Golden Palm Sect. If what they said was true, then they were just as powerful as her, with some being possibly even more powerful. He couldn’t risk his students’ lives.

He immediately shook his head. “Please, let Baldwin go. We surrender. Us adults will stay here. Just please let the students go, they have nothing to do with this.”

Sarah’s face softened at that, but she still shook her head. “Unfortunately, we can’t. However, I can swear on my life that these kids will not be harmed or imprisoned. They will be set free in a little while.”

Talgin sighed in relief. “I thank you for that.”

Afterwards Sarah had everyone of the Golden Palm Sect go towards the center of the town. There, the Ice Dragon Sect was waiting for them. After two minutes, the kids that were sent to the Asura Sect came back. Their clothes were covered in splotches of blood. Their faces were worn, shocked, and filled with anger and sadness.

Not a single person from the Asura Sect followed behind them. Confused, Griffith approached them to ask what had happened. They spoke about things that would haunt them forever. They spoke about the Asura Sect.

The Asura Sect.

A sect filled with assassins. They had mercilessly trained their kids in the ways of battle since they were four years old. It was unfortunate. The Asura Sect sent out everyone they had from their sect. From their show of force, the Asura Sect knew that their enemies did indeed have some powerhouses.

They sent out the kids as cannon fodder, using their young lives without hesitation to identify the supposedly few strong mages that were threatening them. These kids were only Rank 3 or Rank 4 assassins. That didn’t stop them from attacking with all their might. The defending Void Sect members tried to stop them through less destructive means.

Unfortunately, when you have enough wolves, even a lion can fall. The Asura Sect focused on a single kid with over forty of their cannon fodder. His name was Thomas. He was able to block ten, twenty, even twenty three at one time, but there were too many. Others tried coming to his rescue, but just as his mana shield broke, a Rank 5 assassin appeared out of the shadows and sliced his head directly in half.

It was the first loss the kids had suffered since that horrible night. 

It brought forth a rage in them that was unbelievable. Suddenly, spells started spewing forth, lighting up the night. Warrior techniques lashed out when they didn’t have enough time to chant.

It was a slaughter. Not a single person lived through it.

Most of these kids became terrified of themselves. The reason they came was to exact revenge. It was to destroy those that wanted to kill them. They expected fighting. However, looking at the aftermath, seeing the dead bodies that littered the ground; it just didn’t seem like it was worth it. Sadness over the slaughter that had happened, anger at the fact they were forced to kill kids, shock at doing such horrible things, all was visible on their faces.

As the other kids listened to their experience, they rushed over to the Asura Sect to see for themselves. The ground was ripped to shreds. Fire still burned. Icicles could be seen sticking out of still warm flesh. Griffith was saddened immensely at the sight. 

If he had known that such a thing would happen, he would have never tried to do this. The teachers would have come by themselves and wiped out the Asura Sect. It would have at least spared these kids the horror of war for a little longer.

After that, they returned to the square. Some of the teachers had remained behind to watch over their prisoners. Upon returning, Griffith gathered up the students. When he asked them what they wanted to do, a unanimous decision was made.

Griffith stood in front of the group of captives. Clearing his throat, he started to speak with them. “Ahem. Tonight, the former Rising Tide Sect took revenge on the three sects that tried to destroy us. Luckily, both of your sects had the sense to surrender. Unfortunately, the Asura Sect did not. They fought to the end, and we do not believe there is a single surviving member inside White Lotus City.”

“It is something that we all regret doing. If we could, we would prefer to not have to do such a thing again. That is why we have decided to let you all go. None of you will be killed or imprisoned. You are all free. However, we would like to never hear of the Ice Dragon or Golden Palm sects ever again. If we do, then there will be consequences.”

Among the people imprisoned there in the circle, there were some that had killed someone close to the Void Sect disciples. However, after seeing such bloodshed with the Asura Sect, the kids didn’t have the stomach to simply slaughter them.

Everyone started to leave, with the teachers of the now disbanded sects rounding up their students. Some of the students left for their homes inside White Lotus City. To them, it was more important to stay with their families than to follow their sect to places unknown.

The powerhouses of the disbanded sects and the sect leaders left separately. The teachers of the Void Sect assassinated them when they did. It was better to not leave anyone that could be a threat to the Void Sect. Of course, they did not tell their students about this.

Eventually, White Lotus City was left in peace.



<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 130 - New Realms, Old Friends</h1>

Chu Shen and Lucas waited for a while inside the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. After a little while, they suddenly disappeared before reappearing in a large open space.

Lucas sat down and sighed. “Ugh. Having to be on guard all the time just in case we have to move….SO FRUSTRATING!”

Chu Shen sighed as well. “I know, but at least we get to meet some new people every time. Like the twins. I liked Aslo a lot.”

Lucas nodded. “Yeah, Aslo wasn’t too bad. His sister wasn’t that bad to look at either.” He leaned back. “I guess we have met some good people. Except that leg destroying dude. He did make up for it I suppose, but it still sucked.”

Chu Shen sighed. “Come on, just let it go, alright?”

Lucas shook his head. “Nope.”

“Fine. We should at least take a look around, right?” Chu Shen got up and did exactly that. He saw blue grass growing wildly all around him. Buildings made of a white material could be seen. Scorch marks covered the buildings though, and most of them had sections falling in.

Lucas shook his head. “I really don’t like this. I know those kids should be alright, they have far more power than those other sects do. I just can’t stop worrying about them though. How about this, I still have the Chains of Transportation  with a charm connected to the first hunting area we were at. Why don’t I go there and check up on them before coming back?”

Chu Shen smiled. “Great idea. I also have a charm there as well. Why don’t we both go back?”

Lucas nodded. “Sure.”

With a thought, a metal chain appeared around their arms. Reaching down, they touched the ground with the chain. As they did, they both channeled energy into the chain. A small charm appeared around it, with the Chinese symbol for 3 (三) on it.  The first charm led to the Black Night Sect. The second led to the first magic beast hunting zone. The third now led to this open field.

Chu Shen looked at Lucas. “So, are you ready to go back?”

Lucas smiled. “Of course.”

They channeled energy into the “2 ( 二)” charm and disappeared.

What they didn’t know about was the large metal behemoth that appeared five minutes later. It looked like a huge man covered in metal scales. A harsh hissing sound impossible to replicate with the human voice came from the metal creature. It paused for a second before hissing something else.

In a flash of blue light, the creature disappeared from the area.

………………………………………………………………

Chu Shen and Lucas reappeared in the first magic beast hunting zone. Lucas suddenly smacked his head. “You know, I forgot to get the coordinates to teleport us there.”

Chu Shen sighed. “Well, it would also be suspicious if we just appeared out of nowhere.”

Lucas smiled. “Luckily, I still have my spaceship. It has stealth systems on it as well, the true kind. It can jump into hyperspace and it’s cut off completely from this world.”

Chu Shen gestured forward. “Be my guest.”

Immediately, a large teardrop shaped craft appeared in front of Lucas and Chu Shen. It had no outer hatches or viewports and was 928 ft (300 meters) long, with the wide end measuring 246 ft (75 meters). It appeared to be completely solid. Chu Shen looked at it in confusion. “Just how are we supposed to get into this thing?”


Lucas grinned at him. “You walk through the wall of the ship of course. This thing is made of nanites coated in Durasteel X, the strongest material we had in my universe. The weapons it has are limited, only a couple stealth missiles which I made on the side. The power is broadcast from the anti-matter generator I have. Most of the space on it is for the hyperspace system and gravity drive. The rest is used for cabins, missile storage, the weapon vault, food, and a simulation room.”

Chu Shen waved his hand. “I don’t need a step by step breakdown right now, all I need is to check up on those kids.”

Lucas sighed. “Fine. Have it your way.” Lucas approached the ship and touched his hand to the outer hull. The ship’s hull seemed to sink around his hand, enveloping it in liquid metal. Lucas continued walking forward until his entire body seemed to become one with the ship before disappearing inside. 

Chu Shen shrugged and then walked inside himself. It was like being enveloped in metal putty. It gave at his touch. Eventually he found himself standing on a metal walkway inside the ship. Lucas faced him with a smile. “Let’s go then.”
The black ship’s surface rippled before it suddenly seemed to disappear. This was its cloaking mechanism. Its gravity drives activated as it flew at subsonic speeds towards White Lotus City. They didn’t want to attract any trouble with sonic booms, so they avoided going faster than the speed of sound. Two hours later, they had arrived. Chu Shen and Lucas landed outside the city before walking inside after storing the ship inside Lucas’ pocket dimension.

Once inside, they saw people putting up signs. The signs said, ‘Void Sect Registration Now Open. Only Accepting Those with Rank 3 Mage Talent or Lower.’





Chu Shen was surprised by that. They had been gone for less than three hours and they already had everything sorted out? Lucas and Chu Shen exchanged confused glances. Chu Shen approached one of the men putting up the sign. “Uh, excuse me sir. Where is the Void Sect at?”

The man saw Chu Shen and smiled. “It’s not a surprise that you don’t know about them. They only appeared two days ago. They wiped out the Asura Sect and ran the Ice Dragon and Golden Palm Sects off as well. They’re down the road at the center of town. You can’t miss it.”

Chu Shen thanked the man and then they quickly ran towards the Void Sect. While they did, Lucas and Chu Shen started to debate as to why two days had already gone by when it had only been three hours for them. Master Ti Wu put an end to it though. 

‘Enough bickering, you brat. Each realm has a different passage of time compared to the others. You can’t expect them all to have the same passage of time. One minute in one could be a million years in another. It’s all relative to the one you want to compare it to.’

Eventually, they reached the new Void Sect. Going up to the sect, they encountered some of the students. Recognizing their saviors, they were brought to Griffith immediately. There, Chu Shen and Lucas were brought up to speed on all the things that had happened in the two days they were gone. Chu Shen and Lucas were surprised at how smoothly everything went.

After the takeover, all of the townsfolk showed a surprising amount of acceptance. They had suffered under the brutality of the Asura Sect for a while now, and they were all too happy to see them disappear. The fights that had occurred didn’t damage most of the infrastructure of the sects as well so taking over their facilities went nicely.

Chu Shen and Lucas were both relieved by the fact that none of the kids were hurt badly. Except Thomas. They both felt some guilt towards that, since they were sure they could have saved him if they had been there. Griffith gave them some alone time after that.

After about ten minutes, Lucas turned back to Chu Shen. “I don’t think they need us anymore. They’re already established pretty well here. We don’t need anything else from this realm and it would be kind of weird staying in the sect we established.”

Chu Shen nodded as well. “I would say it’s time to go back to that new realm we saw.”





Just as they were deciding to leave, the door flung open. There in the doorway stood a kid who was not a kid. Fifteen year old Aslo had a face that could be called an adult’s. His eyes were fierce, his cheeks scarred. The only thing that took away from his adult features was the baby fat still visible on his face.

He stared at Chu Shen and Lucas. Suddenly, he fell to his knees and bowed to them. “Thank you, thank you. Thanks to you, I have avenged my mother’s death.”

Chu Shen reached down and grabbed his shoulder, pulling Aslo up from the ground. “Please Aslo, don’t do this. We did it because you are a friend. You don’t have to act like this.”

Aslo shook his head. “No, I have to. You are the one that granted me the chance to put my mom’s spirit at peace.”

Lucas slapped him on the back. “Anything for a friend. Anyways Aslo, I’m glad you stopped by. Nice to see you before we leave.”

Aslo immediately focused on Lucas. “Please take us with you!”

Lucas looked confused. “Us?” As he spoke Chrissa stepped through the open doorway.

Aslo nodded. “Yeah. We talked it over and decided that in order to repay you we would like to go with you to wherever it is you decide to go.”

Lucas turned to Chu Shen. “Please, oh pretty please! We need more than just stinking boys. A girl or two would be nice.”

Chu Shen looked at Aslo seriously. “Where we plan on going is far beyond your imagination. It will be extremely far away from here and you will only be able to visit here every once in awhile.”

Aslo and Chrissa both nodded, not a hint of hesitation showing. Chu Shen sighed. “Fine. It was a choice made of your own free will so I have no objection.”

Lucas immediately took out two sets of Chains of Transportation before giving them to Aslo and Chrissa. He gave them a brief explanation before having them wear it. Afterwards they departed the city. In order to not surprise Aslo and Chrissa Lucas avoided using the spaceship and teleported them all to the first magic beast hunting zone. 

Now that he had the coordinates, teleporting them between such distances was negligible. Teleportation was a rare power and considered a Rank 4 Space Magic. However, it wasn’t too uncommon so it wasn’t as surprising as a giant spaceship flying them there.

He guided them on how to make the charms before sending them into his pocket dimension. Inside there, Aslo and Chrissa would go with him when they teleported back to their next realm.

Lucas, Chu Shen, Aslo, and Chrissa disappeared from their world in less than a second.
