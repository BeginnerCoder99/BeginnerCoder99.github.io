“Alright men, do a final sweep of the area and then move out!”
“Yes Sir” The leftovers of the 500-man strong platoon immediately spread outwards towards their assigned sections.
Sergeant Tony Delgado was suited up in the latest of humanities infantry armor, the Falcon Scout Armor III. It was a black skintight suit made of nano-carbon fiber. There was even a motor that amplified their strength by over 20 times.
As he patrolled the remains of the bug nest he kept an eye on his radar and genetic scanner. As he was patrolling he saw something moving out of the corner of his eye. Nothing was on his instruments but that didn’t mean anything. The genetic scanner used DNA to pick up the locations of the bugs. However, it was toggled to not pick up Drone Bugs right now. These types of bugs were easily killed so the army left them to the cleanup crews instead of hunting them down.
They had made sure less than 50 of them were on the planet so the colonists weren't overwhelmed with their numbers. So, there was still some of them on the planet.
Thinking along these lines he lifted his Needle Gun and shot out a small burst. With a sinister hiss five, 1-inch long needles shot out of the Needle Gun towards the moving target. The needles sunk into their target and as they did they released a neurotoxin that was lethal to bugs.
As Sergeant Delgado saw the target the needles had hit he winced. “Aw crap”. It wasn’t a bug!
....................................................................................................
As the world crumbled around Chu Shen, Ti Wu released the Void Qi he had been storing in the form of a bubble. The bubble was barely visible, ghostly even. As bits of rock slammed against the bubble it turned into a muddy colored energy before merging with the black colored Qi. As it did the Qi became increasingly realistic until it formed a solid black shell.
Inside Chu Shen was staring outside at the world as it changed around him. The earth crumbled into bits of rock. The Pagoda’s all disappeared somewhere as well. The disk of land shrunk until it became no longer flat but rather a mountain floating in the air. Water came out of nowhere, forming a large river that flowed down creating a waterfall that flowed into the void of space.
Appearing on the mountain was a deep tunnel. Eventually the whirlwind of the rocks stopped. If Ti Wu had not been there then he would have indeed been crushed to death. It was almost inconceivable that something like that could happen to a martial artist however these were not ordinary rocks. The Qi inside this space could be considered extremely concentrated. This dense Qi had strengthened the rocks until it was even harder than steel.
Master Ti Wu said not a word but manipulated the bubble to float towards the tunnel. The sides of the tunnel were made of rock but somehow was as smooth as glass. Suddenly the tunnel opened to reveal yet another pagoda.
Outside this pagoda was countless decorations and statues. Bits of metal, plants, jewels, and even various beast cores were used to craft the magnificent sight. Each one was unique and the ingredients were rare. Some Chu Shen had never heard of and others Chu Shen had doubted he could ever see.
He gasped in shock. Whoever had created this world was truly an expert. There was nothing else, not even a sign. He walked into the pagoda. It had three rooms. The rooms were labeled the Formation Room, Treasure Room, and Training Room. Chu Shen tried to enter the Treasure Room but before he even got close, a formless pressure forced him back. If he had truly entered he felt as though he would have been crushed.
The same thing happened when he tried to enter the Training Room. When he tried to enter the Formation Room though nothing happened. Upon entering he saw a huge formation set up. It was vast and so incredibly complex he got a headache just looking at it.
A translucent barrier surrounded it, obviously it was protecting the formation. Looking at it Chu Shen had a feeling that it was the formation that kept this place alive. He found a rack of chain bracelets alongside the wall. There were thousands of them. Beside them though was a jade slip. Going over he read it.
It simply said. ‘To those who have arrived at this place be grateful. It is full of surprises and mystery. I created this treasure vault that wanders the realms as an idle past time. It is a collection of all the things I forged on my journey. There are no cultivation methods here, nor martial arts. There are simply wondrous artifacts. If you can pass the test in the Training Room then you may enter the Treasure Room.
I know not everyone will be able to pass right away so instead you must adventure outside. Towards this means I have provided the Chains of Transportation. These chains can transport you wherever you wish, including across dimensions. All you must do is tap the bracelet on the ground while providing some energy.
It will form a unique talisman that when you touch it will transport you there. Be warned though that only ten such talismans can be made, but with how many chains I’ve made I think you can take a couple to counteract that downside. When this place transforms into its pagoda form you will be kicked out.
It will transport itself across various places in that dimension for a while before taking itself to another. Once it leaves that dimension the Chains of Transportation will activate and bring anyone wearing it back here automatically so you can’t get lost, unless you take it off. Don’t worry, you can always return if you wish.'
Ti Wu in his soul form was looking over Chu Shen’s shoulder as he read it. As he did he sighed. 'It was indeed as that senior had said. The crazy fool had indeed carried out his plan. Well, I can use that senior’s craziness to equip Chu Shen with some great gear.'
“Okay Chu Shen, grab some of those chain bracelets then let’s get ready to go. Different realms mean more opportunities, different people, and even different martial arts!”
“Okay master. I guess I just have to wait until then.” Chu Shen cultivated for an hour before the glowing, pulsing formation suddenly stopped. It let out a bright pulse of light. The ground started to crumble again. A barrier just like the one surrounding the formation kicked up around Chu Shen. It covered him, protecting him from the dense rocks. He floated out of the pagoda. The Pagoda was surrounded by the same barrier but suddenly it disappeared.
Chu Shen gasped in awe while Ti Wu snorted. It was a simple energy manipulation barrier. All it did was make it invisible, it hadn’t disappeared. The pagoda’s formed like last time. Then like last time a black door formed at the entrance. Surprisingly the barrier bubble didn’t float towards the door. It hovered in midair for a while but suddenly a black vortex appeared, sucking up the barrier bubble along with Chu Shen.
He appeared suddenly in a strange place. There was lots of rocks and ruins of buildings around. Surprisingly the buildings were made completely out of metal and stone, not wood like the ones he was used to.
Ti Wu said nothing but merely watched. He walked around for a while. Corpses of giant insects almost three times the size of a man were visible everywhere he went. There was extremely little Qi in the corpse and a very small amount in the air.
As he wandered around he suddenly heard a HISS sound and simultaneously something hit him on the left side of his chest and arm. Whatever it was completely penetrated through his body with minimum resistance. Even his hard as metal skin couldn’t stop it, testifying to the power of the weapon.
As he fell to the ground he felt a burning sensation all over his body. It became extremely intense. He screamed for a second before passing out. Before he did the only thing, he could think of was, ‘whatever hit me was poisoned.’
.................................................................................................................
Sergeant Delgado ran up to the kid. He was from Asian descent, that much was obvious from the black hair and skin tone. He pulled out his injector and shot the kid with the antidote. Pulling off his helmet he listened for a heartbeat. He sighed in relief, there was one.
He put his helmet back on and turned on his commlink. “Major! I have something to report Sir!”
“What is it Sergeant?”
“Well Sir, I found an Asian kid on the battlefield.”
“I thought the civilians were evacuated? Oh well, just bring him aboard after you finish sweeping your area.”
“Sir it’s not that simple. I mistook him for a drone bug and shot him with three needles Sir.”
“WHAT! That much could kill even you guys! And you all have immunizations for this stuff! Great, if the news gets a hold of this we’ll all be court martialed for sure.”
“He’s still alive Sir, not sure how. What should I do?”
“What should you do? Run as fast as you can and bring him aboard the dropship! Give him some of the antidote as well but hurry up. We might be able to save him”
“Sir yes Sir.” Sergeant Delgado got off the coms with his Major and immediately ran towards the dropship. As he did he started praying. ‘Don’t die on me kid. I’m begging you, don’t die.’
 
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 41 - This Place Is Strange…</h1>
 
Sergeant Delgado paced in front of the medical bay. He had already taken off the scout armor and was wearing a tight fitting full body outfit made of a thick, sturdy, stretchy material.
Whoosh
As the door slid upwards into the ceiling another man walked out. He was the exact opposite of the sergeant. He had a mustache and black hair with hints of gray unlike the bald sergeant. The man had white skin and the sergeant had dark brown colored skin. The man wore a black suit and on the back, front, and shoulders was a patch with a red cross on it. The sergeant had on the same uniform but the patch had a white background with a black gun with 115 written on it in white.
As the Medical Officer Charles Hugh came out of the medical bay he was tugging at the portable helmet around his neck. “This dang thing is going to choke me someday” he muttered underneath his breath before the sergeant stopped him.
“Officer Hugh sir, how’s the kid?” The officer in question stopped for a second and looked at Sergeant Delgado before the realization struck him.
“Oh, it’s you Delgado, I haven’t seen you since I had to grow an arm for you back on Heldeten. Anyways the kids all right. The antidote worked just fine and we gave him a sedative, he’ll be out for another ten hours or so.”
Sergeant Delgado let out a relieved breath. “Whew. Thank god for that. I feel so sorry for him, you know after I shot him and all.”
“Yeah, I just wonder why he’s here though. His muscle density is almost off the charts for someone his age so he must have been a heavy worlder that moved here with his family but no one we evacuated was reported as having a muscle density like this.” Officer Hugh had a contemplative look on his face as he thought over the conundrum the kid represented.
Sergeant Delgado shrugged. “I don’t know, maybe he’s adopted? Anyways when he wakes up how about letting me know ok? I want to apologize to him for shooting him.”
Officer Hugh nodded. “Sure. The captain decided to restrain him until we hit port. So, when he wakes up I should be there too to keep him calm. Hey how about we head to the cafeteria? While the kids out cold I can have a lunch break.”
“Fine with me.”
As they walked down the hallway, something completely unexpected was going on in the medical bay behind them…
..................................................................................................................
Chu Shen opened his eyes. He was laying down on a comfortable bed inside a weird room. The walls were white and a soft, soothing glow came from the walls. There were strange metal objects on the walls and floors. There were some reflective things hanging on the walls as well.
He tried to turn around to see what was behind him when he felt something tug at his arm. Looking down he saw there was a handcuff on his right arm attached to the bed by a chain. As he glanced around he saw that all his appendages were chained down as well except his head.
As he looked at his settings in confusion he suddenly remembered. Poison! He had been hit with some sort of poisoned dart that had punched through his body. Turning his head, he saw that the holes in his chest and shoulder had some sort of thick green paste on it.
Master Ti Wu was looking at his disciple from inside the Voids Hand soul realm. He had been observing the situation the entire time. Chu Shen’s Null Qi had started neutralizing the poison immediately. From this it was obvious the poison wasn't going to kill Chu Shen immediately. Unfortunately, Chu Shen was asleep otherwise it would have taken only a tenth of the time it took.
From the reaction of the person that had shot him, it was obviously an accident. Most likely the bug corpses were from a fight earlier and he was shot on accident. The weapons they used were very interesting. He had seen nothing like them. They were like crossbows but fired dozens of small projectiles very quickly. There was no visible method of propulsion.
This accident was unfortunate but it was an excellent opportunity to observe his disciple’s actions.
Chu Shen circulated his Qi. With the extra boost to his physique he pulled at the chain on his right arm. The walls started pulsing with an angry red light as the chain started making a creaking noise. He looked at the walls for a couple of seconds before putting it out of his mind.
Concentrating the Qi in his right arm he pulled fiercely at the chain. It came off with a loud SNAP and with a CLANK it landed on the ground. He started pulling off the rest of the chains.
..........................................................................................................
Hugh and Delgado were slowly wandering down to the cafeteria whenever Hugh suddenly stopped. “What’s wrong Hugh?” Delgado asked.
Hugh shook his head. “It’s nothing really, just that the kid woke up sooner than expected, probably due to his biology. Looks like you can apologize a little sooner than I thought.”
Delgado shrugged. “Ok then. Let’s go.” They both started back down the hallway when Hugh’s eyes lost focus for a second. Then he started running down the hallway. He turned back to Delgado.
“Hurry up. That kid somehow broke the restraints we had on him. If we don’t want him panicking we have to get there soon.”
Delgado immediately took off behind Hugh. as he did he started asking questions. “How did he get out? I didn’t see anything on him but jewelry.”
“I don’t know either. The restraints we had were just enough to hold him. Most likely I miscalculated his strength.”

They both had military grade enhancements to their body along with a cybernetic implant. With this almost superhuman boost they could get to the medical bay in a matter of seconds.
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 42 - What’s Going On?</h1>
 
Upon entering both men were stunned. They had both known that the restraints were being broken but seeing it was another thing. To see a kid almost half your size breaking metal handcuffs was so impossible that both men doubted their eyes.
The kid looked up at them. Chu Shen immediately linked them to him being brought here. They had shot him, treated his wounds, and then chained him down to a bed. The events seemed very confusing.
Delgado and Hugh put up their hands. “It’s okay kid it’s okay. It was all an accident. You’re safe now, the bugs have been dealt with.” Delgado started trying to reassure the kid. Chu Shen cocked his head. They were speaking gibberish.
Hugh leaned over and whispered in his ear. “He can’t understand you. There were no implants detected on the medical scan and he doesn’t carry any translators. All he has on him is jewelry with some weird runes carved onto them.”
Chu Shen started walking towards them. Obviously if he couldn’t understand them, then they couldn’t understand him so he didn’t try speaking.
As he got closer Delgado’s military training kicked in. He drew his gun and pointed it at Chu Shen. It was a cable free taser. “Kid, back away slowly and sit on the bed. Doc get a transl- OOF”
Chu Shen saw what was obviously a weapon, from the man’s demeanor, pointed at him. His training in the Voids Hand Shadow Arena made him immediately jump forward. Faster than Delgado’s enhanced nervous system could keep up he snatched the weapon in the man’s hand and punched him in the chest. His mouth made a perfect O shape as he went flying backwards. He crashed into the bulkhead. Delgado was sure that some of his ribs were broken. He laid on the ground groaning and clutching at his chest.
Chu Shen glanced down at his fist and then at the man on the floor. This man was so weak. Hugh was just now reacting to the sudden actions. While he was a soldier it had been a long time since he had to fight.
“Why is he so weak? He should have been able to take at least one of my fists.” Chu Shen muttered to himself. Hugh blinked. His implant automatically translated what Chu Shen had said. Most likely the kid didn’t know how abnormal his strength was.
He cautiously walked over to the cabinet that held the mobile translators. He took out two small metallic disks from a tray. He then walked over to Chu Shen and gestured towards him. He put one on his neck and then held another out to the kid.
Obviously, the gesture was to make sure Chu Shen did not think the device was dangerous. Taking the disk, he put it on his neck. It used static electricity to stick to him without hurting him.
Hugh started speaking. “Hey kid. Sorry about this whole mess. You were accidentally caught in the crossfire between us and the bugs. We brought you back here to treat your injuries but we had to restrain you so you couldn’t irritate your injuries.”
He glanced at the green slime that covered the holes in his body. “The Bio-Gel can’t be irritated or it won’t heal properly.” Chu Shen was confused. The gibberish was suddenly comprehensible.
Obviously, they were still speaking gibberish but now he heard instead his own language. This was probably because of the metal disk they had given him but how it worked was a complete mystery. He started to theorize how it worked before catching himself.
Ignoring the idle thoughts, he had he listened instead to what the man had to say. Apparently, this whole thing was an accident. He was caught in a fight between humans and primordial beasts, or at least their equivalent in this universe.
They had treated him but restrained him so he didn’t mess up the treatment they had given. ‘What a weird treatment.’ Chu Shen exclaimed mentally. Looking over at the man groaning on the floor Chu Shen started to feel bad. “Are we going to help him?” He pointed to him.
“Oh Delgado? With the suit, he’s got on it’s probably a bruise that’s all. Such a big baby. He didn’t whine like that even after his arm got cut off.” Hugh grabbed the medical scanner on his way over and held it over Delgado.
While a blue light scanned Delgado, he turned back towards Chu Shen. “By the way I never got your name. I’m Medical Officer Charles Hugh and this is Sergeant Delgado. We’re both with the United Border Forces.”
“I’m Chu Shen, it’s nice to meet you Medical Officer Charles Hugh.”
“Nice to meet you as well Chu Shen. Just call me Officer Hugh in the future.” He muttered underneath his breath. “Such a mature kid. What a mystery.” With Chu Shen’s cultivation reaching such depths how could he have not overhead Hugh’s statement? But he pretended to miss it out of privacy.
Hugh frowned. The medical scanner wasn’t registering just bruising but fractured ribs, internal bleeding, and even a mild concussion from the impact. Delgado was groaning, almost incoherent from the pain.
“Well this isn’t good. He’s much worse than even you were. Hurry up and help me lift him.” Chu Shen hurriedly went over and picked him up all by himself. The doctor was perfectly fine with that, though he instructed Chu Shen on the right way to pick him up.
He guided Chu Shen over to another door. The door led to a different section of the medical bay. The portion they were in was mostly for patients who needed to rest. The most they could treat there was cuts and abrasions.
Inside the room was a lot of specialized medical equipment but Officer Hugh completely ignored them all and went over to a large tank. He pulled a lever on the side of the tank. It was being filled up with the same gunk that was on Chu Shen’s arm.
The Bio-Gel filled up until it reached the very top of the tank. “Alright Chu Shen, put him inside the tank.”
Chu Shen shook his head. “Won’t he suffocate though?”
“Of course not. You can breathe inside Bio-Gel. Now put him in. The Bio-Gel will speed up the healing process. He’ll be fine in a week.” Hugh was grateful for the concern but irritated at Chu Shen questioning him.
Chu Shen nodded. This realm/dimension would have the most appropriate treatment for themselves. He climbed up the ladder at the side and carefully put Delgado inside the tank. After Hugh checked on Delgado’s status he let out a relieved breath. He turned around and there was Chu Shen staring at him. “Okay, we need to talk.”
 
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 43 - Going to War</h1>
 
Chu Shen followed Officer Hugh to the room he had woken up in. He was panicking now. He was in an unknown realm with no idea what was going on. As a young twelve-year-old kid isolated from politics, Chu Shen was hopelessly naive and didn’t want to lie to them but they would never believe him.
He was still trying to figure out what was going on when he remembered, he wasn’t alone. ‘Master Ti Wu, can you help me?’
‘Oh ho. So, you finally thought of me brat. I’m surprised you still remember me hmmph.’
‘Master, please don’t be like this. I don’t know what to say. The only one I can turn to for help is you.’
‘Fine. Just see what he has to say and then repeat what I say.’
‘Thank you Master.’
Officer Hugh sat down in one of the chairs in the room, oblivious to the conversation that was going on. Chu Shen came back to reality and sat down with him. His relief was obvious on his face.
Hugh misinterpreted his expression as relief that Sergeant Delgado was okay. He cleared his throat and began questioning him. “Now kid, we discovered the bugs were inbound and we evacuated all the civilians two days before the bugs landed.”
“We couldn’t take the bug craft down without some bigger guns but we were able to kill all the ground troops and retake the colony. We finished repelling the invasion less than two hours ago. Now that you have the big picture I need some questions answered.”
“Where were you when all this happened? Why did you not get evacuated? And finally, where are your parents?”
Chu Shen listened and repeated back what Ti Wu said. “I don’t know anything about the evacuation. I lived on the outskirts of the colony alone. I don’t know where my parents are. They left the colony and told me stay put. I heard the fighting and everything going on and then after it all stopped I went to see what was happening and then I was hurt.”
Hugh nodded his head in agreement but inwardly he was skeptical. The UBF had gone house to house confirming everyone was gone. Their genetic scanners hadn’t picked anyone up so unless they had an expensive safehouse with scan blockers they wouldn’t have missed him.
The whole story about his parents leaving the colony also sounded a little fishy. Of course, it could be that they decided to leave on a camping trip and left Chu Shen at home. With his body strength, he had nothing to fear from the other colonists especially since weapons were outlawed.
“Okay, thank you for the information. Let me talk to the captain for a bit and then we’ll decide what we can do.” Officer Hugh walked over to a corner and activated his comm link.
“Hey Jim, I have something to report.”
“What is it doc?” The captain was an old friend of Officer Hugh, dating back to the UBF academy. He was one of the only ones on the ship that could talk so casually to the captain.
“You know that civilian kid that we picked up back at the colony?”
“Yeah. What about him?”
“He woke up. Told one heck of a story. Apparently, his parents left the colony on a trip, probably a camping trip, and told him to stay put. Like a good little kid, he stayed there even through the evacuation. After the firefight, he went out looking for what made the ruckus and he ended up getting shot.”
“Yeah, seems like one heck of a tale.”
“I’m not buying it Jim. The scanners would have picked him up when we went through the town the first time.”
“Take it easy Hugh. The kids what ten, twelve years old? If his parents did go camping or whatever it was then they're probably dead by now. You know that the bug ships scatter breeders all over the place. We had to spend a week hunting them all down. They were most likely eaten by the bugs, we won’t even get a body back.”
“Well ignoring that we have a real problem right now. The kids a monster Jim. Not only did he wake up he broke the restraints and broke Sergeant Delgado’s ribs with a single punch.”
“My God. Did he have on his uniform? It should have protected him from most of the impact.”
“Yeah he did. Didn’t help him too much though. Don’t worry, I have him a Bio-Gel tank.”
“Well this is a problem. What do you think our options are?”
“We can’t keep him in here drugged till we get to port so we’ll have to give him a room. Best thing to do is to assign a roster to watch him and accompany him in the ship. Then we can drop him off at the space station when we get there.”
“Sigh. Hugh, we won’t have an option. The bugs launched an all-out attack at Getrin. UBF needs all the troops they can get and we’re one of the closest. We don’t have time to drop him off and neither is there any civilian ships capable of docking with us to transfer him over. He’s coming with us to the Getrin for the bug invasion.”
“That’s not an option. We can’t take civilians into a live combat situation.”
“There’s over ten million people on Getrin. If we don’t go there won’t be any left. You know the capital ships are all protecting the major planets. Little colonies like this have only us ground pounders to protect them.”
“I know. We have to prioritize the important things, right?”
“Right Hugh. Listen. I’m sorry for involving you in this.”
“Yeah. I’ll break the news to the kid okay?”
“Thanks Hugh.”
Hugh signed off and sighed. Glancing over he saw Chu Shen looking at him with expectant eyes. ‘He thinks we’re bringing him back to his parents. Now what do I say?’

Little did he know that Chu Shen with his sensitive hearing had been eavesdropping the entire time. ‘I wonder if they call cities planets here. Only thing that makes sense. So, the bugs are the primordial beasts they fought with before huh? Looks like I’m going to war…’
 
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 44 - They’re Coming</h1>
 
After Hugh explained why they couldn’t drop him off to be with his ‘family’ he had sent Chu Shen to a room and then assigned a guard to him.
The guard was kind though Chu Shen didn’t like the looks of pity that he gave him every now and then. The guard had pointed out a couple weird things that were in the cabin. There was something called a hologram, a food synthesizer, and there was a desk and chair that he had called the computer interface.
After pointing out everything the guard told Chu Shen, “Just ask the computer any questions and it will answer you.”
Chu Shen looked at the guard. “Who is the computer and how do I ask it to do anything?”
The guard stared at Chu Shen trying to determine if he was serious. He was. ‘Country hick huh. I didn’t think the colony was that bad but maybe the parents were anti-tech.’
“Well the computer is not a person but an object, an artificial intelligence programmed to watch over the crew. If you want to ask any questions just say it aloud.” After that the guard left to stand outside the room.
Chu Shen didn’t get what he meant but if the computer could talk to Chu Shen and it was an object, then it must be like a treasure spirit. They were rare but occasionally they did appear in high-level treasures.
Chu Shen sat down to cultivate but when he did he frowned. He could sense energy was barely present inside the room. There was a vast flood of it a little bit away but for some reason it was being blocked. He couldn’t cultivate like this, otherwise even with his cultivation technique it would take over a couple of months to breakthrough, such was the small amount of energy available in the room.
Chu Shen tried talking to Master Ti Wu but for some reason he couldn’t contact him. (Inside the Voids Hand Ti Wu decided to take a break. He really didn’t want to try and answer his disciple’s constant questions so he blocked himself off.) Since he couldn’t contact him he decided to ask the computer some questions.
“Computer, where am I, what city am I in?” Chu Shen felt a little bit silly talking to air like this but what happened next truly surprised him.
A voice that for some reason had a bland voice with a metallic undertone answered his question. “You are aboard the UBF Spaceship Casanova. We are in hyperspace currently en-route to the colony Getrin. We shall arrive there in three hours, exactly fifteen minutes before the bugs land on the surface. “
Chu Shen looked around in surprise before becoming excited. He’d never thought he’d meet a treasure spirit or artificial intelligence as the soldier had put it. He looked like a kid in a candy store.
“What’s a spaceship and what’s hyperspace.” He asked the computer for clarification on some points.
“A spaceship is a mechanical vehicle using a variety of methods to cross space to reach other destinations such as moons, worlds, asteroids, and other celestial bodies. Hyperspace is described as a subspace that FTL or faster-than-light travel is possible through using a special energy called Tachyons.”
Chu Shen had an expression of deep shock. Travel to other worlds was basically a pipe dream until they reached a level of a Cosmo’s Immortal. These people on the other hand barely cultivated. There was only the smallest of Qi inside their bodies yet through mechanical means they could travel to other worlds by themselves? This was absolutely amazing!
Chu Shen started quizzing the computer on both history and asked for descriptions of these spaceships and it provided blueprints for him. Of course, he didn’t understand everything so he had the computer help him. Since he was a cultivator he had a photographic memory. He gained a lot of knowledge and before he knew it, three hours were up.
Captain Jimmy Hentle looked at the readout of bug types. He frowned. This was extremely bad. They had only transports which was good but there was over 300 of them. Previously his ship’s division of 500 Scouts, 2000 Heavy Infantry, 200 Mechanized, and 100 Floater troops had destroyed the single transport at Chu Shen’s colony with about 128 deaths and 301 injuries. Luckily only about 40 of them couldn’t be patched up before the fight.
A clear majority of the deaths and injuries had been in Scouts and Heavy Infantry with only about 50 spread out between the other divisions. That particular transport had no flying or anti-air bugs on it so there were no deaths in the Floater division.
They had about 70 ship divisions available along with a carrier and 30 fighters. They could destroy some of the craft on the way down but certainly not all of them. Once the bugs landed they would almost certainly have some anti-space elements and anti-air elements mixed in with their numbers.
The civilians were all evacuated into the shelters inside of two cities but the UBF couldn’t protect them for long. At most they could defend for two days. The good thing though was that there were another 120 ship divisions along with 10 frigates and 2 small destroyers and carriers inbound.
If they could hold off the bugs for 1 day they could save the entire population. Otherwise they were doomed. There was a General on one of the ships and he was organizing everyone.
The captain landed the ship in his designated spot. Checking out the tactical map he saw he was towards the frontlines. He started trying to get in contact with the general. He had to know there was a civilian on his ship. If he was at the frontlines, then there would definitely be a media catastrophe, blaming the UBG for purposefully endangering civilians. Unfortunately, with there being only another three minutes until the bugs landed, how could the general have time for him?
The soldiers got off the ship. There were scouts dressed in armor like Delgado had, then there were much larger suits with full body armor. Lines of energy ran throughout the armor unlike the completely black scout armor.
Then there was a variety of vehicles such as the large gravity tanks, the small one-man mortar scooters, the medium size hovercraft with different weapons systems like lasers, plasma guns, machine guns, missiles, and grenade launchers.
The ship itself began burrowing itself into the ground. The soldiers started setting up fortifications along with portable machine and energy guns on and around the ship. The ship was obviously going to be used as a temporary base when the bugs attacks. Various guns popped out of hatches on the ship. Far off there was other ships, barely visible with the naked eye.
The soldiers had completely prepared for the invasion. The bugs had landed over twenty minutes ago. The fighters had been able to pick off about 13 transports but the fighters were forced to back off after the anti-aircraft bugs were set up. These bugs launched balls of plasma at the fighters. Over a third of the fighters was forced back.
A couple of soldiers was talking on the fort.
“Hey, do you think we’ll make it?”
“Of course not. We’re one of the first ones to confront the bugs.”
“Yeah, but now we don’t have to worry about being eaten or processed.”
“Why not?”
“Well if you’re suit opens up the radiation will fry your brains out.”
“Oh yeah. Makes you wonder why they even set up a colony out here anyways.”
“Greed. There’s lots of minerals out here. Makes it a pain for the colonists but the radiation force fields protect them fairly well.”
“Sigh, it’s always because of credits, isn’t it?”
“Yep. Ironic that I signed up to the military for the credits and here I am about to die protecting someone else’s credits.”
“Shhh. You hear that?” The three Heavy Infantry men stopped talking. As they listened carefully there was a dull rumbling sound coming from in front of them. There was a large dust storm gathering in front of them. The ground started shaking.
“What is it?” One of them asked, fear obvious in his voice. The one next to him shook his head. He’d fought for ten years against the bugs. He was no stranger to what this was.

“That son is a bug stampede. EVERYONE GET READY. THEY’RE COMING”
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 45 - Private Viradne</h1>
 
Chu Shen was asking the computer questions left and right. The hologram displayed a 3-d image of a ship. It had no scale but it was tear drop shaped. The top was round and bulging but the bottom was flat. All over the ship was hatches of various sizes though at the bottom under the pointed front was three large hatches and the top had a single oversized hatch.
This ship was what Chu Shen was currently on. The hatches on the flat bottom held mining tools to dig the ship into the ground for fortification. The large hatches were used to release the troops and the rest was for the ships guns and anti-fighter missiles. The ship itself was faster than anything but a fighter so it was only equipped for anti-fighter and anti-personnel duty as the compute had explained to Chu Shen.
The hologram switched to a display of a rifle. In a couple of minutes, it switched to other handheld weapons. Chu Shen was just starting to study the automated suits used for combat when all of a sudden, he felt a strong sense of dizziness. He fell down on the ground. Inside the Voids Hand Ti Wu sensed this and stood up from his meditation.
The sensation passed after a couple of seconds. He looked up at the ceiling. “Computer, why did I feel dizzy?”
“The cause of dizziness was from the exit of hyperspace. Upon exiting various side effects such as nausea, dizziness, vomiting and other symptoms may appear. Studies show that after ten or more hyperspace exits and or entrances the side effects will have a diminished or no effect.”
Upon hearing this Chu Shen and Ti Wu was relieved. It was a temporary effect and not intentional.
“Warning. We are entering Getrin’s atmosphere to confront the bugs. ETA until bugs touchdown on planet is fifteen minutes. ETA until landing on Getrin will be updated when the information is available.”
Chu Shen sat down on his bed. He looked up at the ceiling. “Computer can you explain what exactly the bugs are?”
“The bugs are a series of genetically engineered soldiers that resemble insects made by the K’ateesh. These soldiers come in various forms and have been repeatedly sent to try and destroy humanities grip on various star systems. The conflict arose whenever the K’ateesh were discovered by a colony group."
"The K’ateesh believe they should be the only intelligent beings in the universe and have aggressively wiped out any other species they find. Because of the fact that both species live on the same type of planets and value most of the same resources, both try to engage on the ground instead of commencing orbital bombardment to preserve those resources.”
"However. The K'ateesh have been deemed a class 6 threat since they cannot threaten humanity as a whole. On the edges of civilized space such as this, technology is very backwards. Because of this the K'ateesh and the bugs are at a stalemate with the fringes of humanity. However, if the decision to wipe out the K'ateesh makes it through Human Space Council board then it could be accomplished in a matter of days."
Chu Shen nodded. So, the bugs were just puppets and they were the aggressors. Politics was the only thing slowing down the annihilation of the bugs. “How do the bugs act, what do they look like, and what are their weapon capabilities.”
“The bugs are mindless creatures. The K’ateesh won’t make an intelligent soldier since it is against their belief so instead they program them to instinctively attack anything not like the K’ateesh or themselves. Certain bugs such as the plasma bugs specifically target only airborne targets while the drone bugs attack anything on the ground.”
“The bugs have various looks based upon their function. Drones are six legged creatures with a hard exoskeleton. Their front two claws are extremely sharp and as hard as steel. The plasma bugs use an organic process to create balls of plasma and launch them into the air. Some plasma bugs are as big as this ship and are capable of launching plasma into orbit. Warrior bugs are the same as drones but have enhanced capabilities. The scout bugs are…”
Chu Shen paid attention to the various types of bugs as their image popped on screen while the computer explained their capabilities. After all he would soon have to fight them. Halfway through the list there had been a thud and then a series of scraping and grinding noises. The computer told him they had landed on the planet and was fortifying themselves.
The computer finished the explanation eventually after 20 minutes. The list of bugs was extensive. Most of them though Chu Shen felt confident in handling.
While Chu Shen was contemplating the future battle, unknown to him it had already started.
………………………………………………….
HISS PSEEW PSEEW BANG SCREE CLACK CLACK WHOOSH
The battleground was a mess of noises. Energy beams shot out with a pseew while the needles hissed through the air. Mortars were launched landing with loud bangs. The bugs screamed out in anger and pain as they were shot, burned, blown up, and burned again.
The floaters whooshed through the air and explosions rocked the ground where they flew over. They were purely atmospheric bombers and were far nimbler than the space fighters were planet side.
The bugs so far were drone bugs. They were a blue green mottled color. The bugs were as tall as a man and twice as long. They looked like a giant cockroach but the head was raised up and looking towards them. In front of the head was two black arms that ended in blades. The reach of the blades was almost 1 meter.
Private Viradne was a heavy infantryman. The bugs came in a huge wave. At first, they were dark colored blurs in the horizon. He, along with his entire squad had fired the second they were in range. The cockroaches required several rounds to kill each one and it was almost impossible to target a single cockroach in such a huge horde.
The bugs left mounds of bodies piled up as they ran towards the barricaded ground troops. Explosions sent up huge amounts of bugs flying. Private Viradne confirmed killing at least 200 bugs by himself. Bits of antennae and exoskeletons flew upwards, green blood splattered everywhere. But the bugs kept coming.
They could afford the losses. The breeder bugs just kept making more. It was like a swarm of rats. The landscape was like a desert previously. Only red sand and orange rocks popped up out of the plains. Now it was more like a horror film.
Private Viradne fired his needle gun. His implant synchronized with his targeting system. HISS HISS. The needles shot outwards and buried themselves into the exoskeleton of the bugs.
The ship’s guns were firing behind him. The noises from all the heavy fire and explosions would have been deafening if his suit didn’t isolate the noise. The bugs got closer and closer. Soon they were no longer 800 meters (half a mile) away but now 100. The bugs were reaching the edges of the barriers.
“AAAAAAAGH” “GET IT OFF ME!!!” “EAT THIS YOU COCKROACHES!”
Shouts came from the soldiers as the bugs swarmed them. Private Viradne saw a bug running towards him, less than two meters away. He fired his gun and the bug fell backwards from the impact. Three more climbed up to join them.
He kept firing killing two but the third got close enough to swing its bladed appendage at him. He ducked underneath it but was hit by the bug’s body. It hadn’t stopped running at him. He flew backwards losing his gun. The bug landed on top of him.
“AHHH” Private Viradne screamed in rage. He deployed his suits vibroblades. The half a meter-long blades came out of his forearms. The blades hummed as it vibrated over 10,000 times a second. He swung upwards at the bug’s body. It came apart in a shower of green blood and guts. The bug squirmed around as it tried to kill him. Using the vibroblade he cut the thing in half, emerging from its bloody body.
Standing up he saw that there were another thirty bugs on the platform with him. His four squad mates were fighting with them, barely holding them off with their vibroblades.
Another five of his squad mates were on the ground. One had a chunk of his suit missing. He was shaking and having a seizure. The radiation was frying his brain. Unseen to Private Viradne was the boils that appeared on his skin as the radiation attacked him. The others were either in the same condition or they were being eaten by the bugs.
Private Viradne was shaken at the sight of his teammates being eaten. He withdrew his vibroblades, reached down, grabbed his needle gun, and started firing. He drew the attention of five drone bugs. The ran towards him. He sprayed them with needles slowing them down. Suddenly his gun stopped firing. Warning. Ammo has been depleted. His implant toned in his head.
The bugs were getting closer. Only one had died. Two simultaneously swung their blades at him. Knowing he couldn’t dodge he deployed his vibroblade and blocked their blades with it. Another two bug blades buried themselves in his chest and leg. Refusing to give up he leaped forward, cutting off one of the insect’s head. He cut off all the legs on the side of the other bug. More and more blades stabbed into him.
He laughed. “HAHAHA. You’ll NEVER eat me you REVOLTING bugs!” With that he activated his suits self-destruction option. The nuclear battery in his suit overloaded. It exploded, destroying all 30 bugs on the platform, his squad mates, and another 20 bugs in the surrounding area.
Amidst the incinerated section of the fortification and the sundered, bloody bits of metal, bug parts, and human limbs came another 100 bugs.
This was war.
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 46 - Chu Shen Joins the Fight</h1>
 
Chu Shen was still thinking about how exactly to help in the upcoming fight whenever he started hearing things. Tap tap tap. It sounded like rain was hitting the roof of a building. Other sounds came faintly to Chu Shen but he couldn’t identify most of them. The best he could come up with was a muffled drum.
“Computer, what is the noise I’m hearing?” Chu Shen looked up at the ceiling.
“There is no noise registering in human hearing range.”
“I can hear a tapping noise, like rain. Please identify that.”
“That is machine gun fire from the troopers outside.”
“What! You mean they’ve actually started fighting already? Why didn’t they tell me!?”
“It was because they didn’t wish to worry you. Because we are one of the late arrivals we were put on the front lines. The first massive wave of bug drones is attacking now. While this first wave is the biggest what follows is waves of tougher bugs.”
Chu Shen went up to the door and opened it. Outside was the guard that was assigned to watch him. Unlike before where the guard was in a black uniform he was now in a heavy infantrymen suit.
The guard turned towards Chu Shen as he walked out. “Hey, hey kid! You can’t be out here, there’s a war going on.”
Chu Shen looked at the guard’s helmet. Because of his studying he knew exactly what this was. An outdated exo-suit designed to protect against blunt projectiles and radiation. It increased the wearer’s strength by over 50 times along with having a deployable vibroblade.
It was extremely out of date but the UBF was also underfunded since it was on the very fringes of known space. It was the cheapest and best suit to get.
He looked at where he figured the guard’s eyes were. “That’s why I’m here. Since I’m a heavy worlder I figured I might be able to help a little with the bugs. They attacked my town so I want some payback.”
Chu Shen had of course looked up what the captain and medic had labeled him as.
The guard was stunned for a couple of seconds but he called up the captain. “Sir. The civilian kid says he wants to fight. He is a heavy worlder sir so he might be able to help some.”
The captain was startled. He had completely forgot about the kid, he was a distraction he could ill afford. He started to consider the guards suggestion. Eventually the war would get to them. While the drones couldn’t break through the ship’s armor the warrior and tank bugs after certainly could.
“Alright. Give him a suit then get him to a hovercraft. We need to evacuate this kid now. The floater can take him farther down the line. Escort him to one of the hovercraft. Go now.”
The guard was surprised. “Okay kid you got your wish. Come on, we’ll fix you up some scout armor.” He didn’t tell the kid he was being evacuated since he didn’t want to have the kid running off or fighting him.
They walked down some hallways, up elevators till they reached the part of the ship where the floaters were launched at. There were some armored scout outfits that the pilots wore. Luckily some of the pilots were dwarfs, children that were not genetically engineered for heavy gravity, resulting in the stagnation of growth along with heavy muscle density.
“Here kid, put this on.” The guard threw one of the outfits towards Chu Shen. Then the guard grabbed a heavy needle gun and a vibro-sword. Only high-ranking officers had clearance for them because of how expensive they were but because of his mission clearance he could have one.
Silently Chu Shen put it on. The guard turned around after he grabbed his sword, expecting to have to help Chu Shen into the outfit. Unexpectedly Chu Shen was waiting for him completely dressed. The guard checked his helmet seal before walking towards the closed blast doors.
The reason Chu Shen was dressed so fast was because of his studying and because of how fast his Qi enhanced body was. The guard opened the door. He closed the first door after they were both in and then opened the next door. The airlock helped keep the radiation out of the ship.
As soon as they stepped out Chu Shen’s face lit up. There was Qi all around them! The ship looked like a giant turtle shell. Walls built in a honeycomb structure with platforms suspended between them every now and then spread outwards for close to 300 meters. Drone bugs were fighting and killing soldiers all over the place.
“Come on kid! The floater should meet with us soon. Just stand here and they’ll pick us ughh!”
The guard pointed to a platform near them when suddenly, a bug that had been climbing the wall appeared. As the bug charged towards the guard Chu Shen immediately sprang into action.
He activated his spatial ring, the 1 ½ meter long hammer appearing in his hand. Chu Shen pushed off the ground with the tip of his foot, moving at mind boggling speed. He shoved the guard to the side out of the bug’s way as he flew past. Swinging his hammer so fast that a small sonic boom echoed out, he hit the bug in the side of its carapace.
The hammer changed from being only 20 pounds to being over 3,000 pounds and crashed into the bugs side. If it could be seen in slow motion this is how it would be described.
The hammer first hit the bug’s legs, snapping them like dry wood. Then the exoskeleton of the bug was hit. The exoskeleton cracked as soon as it was hit. The hammer didn’t stop though and went completely through the bug. To be more accurate, it exploded outwards like someone hit it with a grenade as the kinetic force was transferred throughout the bug.
It looked like a baseball bat hitting a water balloon. The guard that Chu Shen had shoved hadn’t even hit the ground yet when the bug was killed. Chu Shen turned around and ran towards the guard, grabbing him before he hit the ground.
The guard had no idea what was going on. The kid moved so fast that he couldn’t even keep track of him.
Chu Shen set the guard down. Looking around there were more bugs than he could count. He smiled. They could be counted as a Man Stage Level 8-10 primordial beast. Compared to a peak Dragon Stage cultivator, they could be killed by the droves.
The Qi in the air was thicker than even the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion’s. Chu Shen gripped his hammer tight in preparation, then he leapt towards the closest platform.
He was ready to kill some bugs.
After all.
This was war.
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 47 - This. Is. Sparta!</h1>
 
Chu Shen flew through the air. He landed on one of the platforms. A couple of soldiers were there fighting for their lives. As Chu Shen went towards them he saw one of them deploying vibroblades and cutting a bug in half.
He smiled. The power of vibration was truly wondrous. When he could master the <Song of The Stars> then this kind of attack would be child’s play. Looking down at his hands he stored the vibro-sword in his storage ring.
He landed on the platform. While it was true that advancing in cultivation led to greater strength, the true benefits were subtler.
The best benefit was speed. There was a saying in the martial world. Defense can be broken, attacks can be blocked, but speed is king. What good is an attack that can’t land on the opponent? How can you defend against an attack you can’t see? Only speed can have advantages while also having no disadvantages.
It can be used for both attack and defense while to focus on merely attack or defense can lead to a crucial lack of strength.
Chu Shen dashed around the platform. Each bug on the platform received a single blow from his hammer before exploding in a huge spray of gore. The soldiers could only see a blur as Chu Shen attacked. He picked up a gun from one of the dead soldiers. Storing his hammer away he grabbed the rifle with both hands.
He fired a couple of rounds to get a feel for the accuracy. With that Chu Shen turned around and pointed it at the bugs. Recalling the models of the drone bugs Chu Shen aimed at the bugs heart and brain. Firing a single needle at each drone the needles flew accurately, unerringly finding their targets.
Chu Shen frowned. He wasn’t truly happy with this kind of weapon. Bending down he instead grabbed two pistols from the dead bodies. When the Needle Gun runs out of ammo these pistols would be used until they could reload.
Suddenly someone flew two platforms over, a streak of blue appearing under their shoes. They were dressed in a scout armor, though it was clearly different.
Instead of the armor being pure black it had skull marks on both shoulders. The helmet looked like a white Spartan helmet instead of a pure black dome like everyone else had. The armor was thicker than every other scout armor. The arm guards and the leg guards bulged outwards slightly. In the leg guards case, it was obviously because of the gravity boots.
Wielding two pistols the abnormal scout flew in above the bugs, his dual pistols firing. Because of his superior position in the air, the bugs couldn’t hurt the scout. All the bugs died without a fight.
Chu Shen started using the two pistols he started firing at more bugs. The bugs went down just as easily as before. With his Qi enhanced reflexes and senses, it was no wonder he could outshoot even those with an implant.
The soldiers that Chu Shen had saved could see him standing on the platform. They were all stunned by what they saw. His hands were a blur, such was his firing speed. Every time he fired a bug fell. This was an unbelievable example of accuracy.
While they were all stunned at what they saw, a bug climbed up the edge of the platform. As the bug rushed at Chu Shen’s back he sensed something was wrong. Leaping into the air he dodged the bugs charge.
Storing the pistols inside his ring he withdrew the vibro-sword. With a push of a button the nuclear battery inside the vibro-sword activated. As it started vibrating Chu Shen landed on the ground. Pushing off the platform he sliced the bug in half with a spray of gore.
Withdrawing the sword, Chu Shen took off from the platform, leaving behind him a small group of soldiers.
“Did you see what I saw?”
“Yeah, that scout was unbelievable.”
“You know, I heard that some mercenary joined us, a friend of the captain. Supposedly he’s extremely fast because of some enhancements he has.”
“I heard that too. It’s said he had a military-grade enhancement.”
“But we have military-grade enhancements too, how come his is so different.”
“Idiot”
“It’s because he didn’t get a UBF enhancement. Supposedly he came from Sparta. They say he's one of those clone soldiers.”
“What! No way!”
“It’s no wonder he’s so good at fighting. Everyone from Sparta is a monster. I thought he’d be taller though.”
.................................................................................................
One hundred, two hundred, three hundred, within twenty minutes almost five hundred drone bugs lost their lives to Chu Shen. He also personally saved almost ninety soldiers while protecting over two hundred
No one could keep up with him on the battlefield. Chu Shen thought before looking over his shoulder. Well, almost no-one. Surprisingly there was one person that was as strong as him, or even slightly stronger.
It was the abnormal scout that Chu Shen had glimpsed back then. The scout became exceedingly stranger as Chu Shen saw more of him. Not only did he have a modified scout armor, but he also had extremely expensive equipment, with the gravity boots being one of a long list.
Shooting grappling cables out of his suits arms, the abnormal scout used the bug he had caught as a battering ram. He twirled it around him, knocking back the bugs that were trying to surround him.
Then a bright beam of energy shot out as he used an energy beam on the underside of his right arm. Miniature explosive disks shot out from the left arm.
He was like a one-man army.
Chu Shen smiled. Both of them were clearly an example of skills from both worlds. Chu Shen with his Qi enhanced body and antiquated hammer, and the abnormal scout with his advanced weapons and enhancements.
He frowned. The Qi was thick in the air, but again Chu Shen couldn’t absorb it. It was like something was preventing the Qi from reaching him.
Although they couldn’t know, most of the other ships in the area had been over run. With the ship’s guns still working though, most of the ship’s decided to stay until a Tank or Warrior bug showed up. Besides, with the plasma bugs instincts to fire on anything flying, most ship captains wouldn’t risk being blown up.
Suddenly an abnormality appeared. A bug appeared but it was different from the other bugs. If it could be described it would be like a flea with blades for its front limbs. With this new bug, it meant that the second wave had reached the front lines.
With a sudden burst of speed, the Hopper Bug, as it was called, shot forward, slicing Chu Shen’s helmet!
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 48 - Qi is deadly?</h1>
 
Normally even though the hopper bug was fast, Chu Shen could have avoided it. After all it was maybe half as fast he himself was. However, it was truly unfortunate that the bug was behind Chu Shen when it climbed onto the platform.
Chu Shen once again sensed there was a bug behind him as the hopper leaped towards him. Forcing his body to move sideways he dodged most of the blow, but unfortunately the hopper bug was truly too fast. Instead his helmet was cut at the seams, barely avoiding his neck.
Radiation poured into his suit, alarms started blaring. However, Chu Shen didn’t hesitate. He ran towards the hopper bug, firing his pistols as he went. The hopper bug landed on the edge of the platform but fell due to the repeated shots of the pistols, dying from the neurotoxin.
The abnormal scout flew down and landed next to Chu Shen. His radio activated and a deep gruff voice came on. “Soldier, you’re suits integrity has been compromised. If you have anything inside the pocket dimension to fix your suit up, act quickly otherwise the radiation will fry you alive.”
Chu Shen meanwhile was basking in something completely unexpected. Qi! It was Qi! Ever since he arrived in this realm for some reason he had not been able to absorb Qi and now he could!
Upon hearing the radio though he suddenly thought of a possibility. He had read on the ship that radiation was various forms of energy transmitted through space but now that he thought of it, wasn’t this also the definition of Qi?
Of course! Radiation was deadly to normal people! So of course, their armor and spaceships would block radiation or rather, Qi. This was why Chu Shen couldn’t gather Qi even when he could sense it. It was indeed being blocked.
Instead of pulling out a suit patch as the abnormal scout had suggested, Chu Shen instead unsealed his helmet completely. The scout was taken back by the young face that confronted.
Then he started yelling. “WHAT ARE YOU DOING! YOU’LL DIE IF YOU DO THAT!”
Chu Shen didn’t say a word but rather shook his head. Then he started circulating his Qi. The Qi in the area started gathering towards him. The energy circulated through his internal meridians.
With the fresh surge of Qi, it was like basking in a hot shower. A soothing feeling came over him as the Qi penetrated his body. Feeling refreshed Chu Shen immediately took off, ignoring the abnormal scouts astonished look. He started looking for more hoppers, shooting them the second he saw them.
Circulating his Qi, Chu Shen could keep gathering Qi as he fought. Honestly the Qi expended wasn’t a whole lot. Most of what he was using to fight the bugs was his physical body.
Chu Shen fought with the abnormal scout, who looked on him with awe. They fought the bugs continuously for two hours. Now the horde of bugs had thinned a lot however now it was rare to encounter a drone bug. Hopper bugs were exceedingly more common now.
The floaters were tasked with thinning the horde out before they reached the fortified positions. They were doing a good job too but most were starting to fall back due to return fire.
The plasma bugs weren’t so good at hitting small agile targets like the floaters but the tanker bugs were finally starting to slowly crawl up. They were huge cockroaches. There was a large tube sticking out of the bugs neck, pointing straight forward along with a bunch of smaller tubes sticking out of its back.
A floater flew past, dropping bombs as it went by. The tanker bug looked up. The small tubes on its back started glowing blue. Then over twenty basketball size plasma balls flew upwards.
The floater dodged most of them but one burned a hole through the back of the floater. With smoke billowing out of it the floater fell down into a swarm of bugs before exploding. It left a huge crater from all the bombs it held inside it exploding as well.
Chu Shen saw the sight and immediately focused on the tanker bugs. These he knew were going to be tough. The biological armor was thick, almost ten times as thick as the drone bugs were. Not to mention the large plasma tube on the front.
While he was puzzling over how to kill such a creature, a large explosion went off. It was a one of the one-man scooters. There were five of them in a small group floating in the air. They were out of reach of most bugs and so far, had stayed out of the fight.
Their explosives were best for penetrating a tanker bugs skin, not for large explosives like the floaters. Firing in unison the group of scooters launched small, baseball size mortars towards the tanker bug.
The explosives hit the creature. The shaped charges unleashed a blast that sent metal shrapnel cutting into the creature’s hard outer shell before reaching the inside of it. The flammable material used to create the plasma balls ignited in the explosion. With a loud WHOOOSH, the tanker bug went up in flames.
Because of the nature of plasma, it was not explosive however it was extremely flammable. Chu Shen looked around for a little bit before finding an appropriate tanker bug. Once he did he took off for it.
Meanwhile the abnormal scout had taken off towards a tanker bug himself. Flying down he landed next to one of the plasma tubes. Because of the hard exoskeleton and the way, the scout had flown in, the tanker bug didn’t notice him.
The scout waited until after the tube had fired off a plasma ball before dropping one of the explosive disks from his right arm into the tube.
The disk fell downwards until it reached the inside of the beast. Three seconds later the disk exploded, making the bug burst into flames. Of course, the scout was long gone by then.
Chu Shen though, dashed forward at breakneck speeds. Reaching the side of the tanker bug, he swung the hammer with all his might. The hammer hit its side, cracks appeared in the armor where it was hit.
Unfortunately, that was all that happened. The tanker bug slid sideways a couple of inches while Chu Shen used the force of the blow to flip backwards, landing on the dusty ground. He frowned. So, one blow wasn’t going to cut it.
He got an idea though. Turning his hammer around he reversed it so that the spike end was now where the blunted end usually was. He leapt upwards onto the creature’s back. Using the spiked end as a pick axe he swung it downwards, penetrating the exoskeleton.
Using the spiked end, he pulled a hunk of the armor off with brute force. With the proper leverage, it was easy. Then Chu Shen had a problem. What did he do now?
He put back the hammer and instead pulled out the pistols. Firing them rapidly into the hole in its armor, Chu Shen fired towards where he guessed the heart and plasma chamber was. The beast shuddered in agony as the needles went through its body, delivering their deadly payload.
Plasma fired out randomly from its tubes as it started jerking around. It started twitching and jerking its legs as Chu Shen kept firing. After a couple rounds the thing started to slow down. Then it fell to the ground and the plasma balls stopped shooting.
Chu Shen hopped off the tank bug and nodded in appreciation. ‘Heh. That thing was pretty big.’
With that Chu Shen turned around and promptly started off towards another tanker bug. It seemed these things were most definitely the bigger threat.
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 49 - Retreat!</h1>
 
Chu Shen and the abnormal scout kept destroying tanker bugs as they went. He used various methods, besides the hammer. Using one of the grenades he picked up from a fallen scout, he copied the abnormal scout’s method of destruction.
Then he used the vibro-sword for a while. It cut through the bugs exoskeleton swiftly but unfortunately it broke from Chu Shen’s massive strength. As Chu Shen fought he realized that this was not where most of the action was.
He was on the small fortress they had built around the ship, that was true. However, most of the killing was taking place before the bugs even reached the fortification.
It was honestly an interesting strategy. A single soldier could kill a hundred bugs with their guns. A single blast from a tank could kill fifty bugs. So, it was set up to in a three-layered formation.
First there was the fortress with the soldiers on it. Then there was the ship. After that was the various types of machinery like the tanks. The flying vehicles like the hovercraft and scooters were scattered everywhere.
Because the bugs went by instinct, they only attacked what was in front of them. This way while the bugs attacked the fortress the heavy machines at the back would thin their numbers before they even reached the fortress. Then until they could break through the ship, the machines could again pound the enemy lines.
Once the ship took off or the bugs started looking for other prey though, the vehicles would take off, outrunning the bugs to reach another ship farther down the line and reinforce them.
This way there was a minimum amount of firepower lost and instead as the bugs came closer and closer to the city they would face more and more resistance. Truly it was an ingenious way of conserving firepower but it was also clearly ruthless. The ground soldiers were being used as a distraction.
Chu Shen and the abnormal scout continued fighting for another hour. A total of three hours had passed since Chu Shen had started fighting with them.
Soon however there was very few troops left. At most there was a handful or two. Suddenly the ship opened the hovercrafts launch platform along with some hatches on the top of the ship opened.
Radios belched out a command. “Retreat. We won’t do any more good here. Command has ordered a general retreat for the front lines. We are to fall back to the rear for resupplies before being redeployed. All hovercraft are to do a bombing run close to the ship to cover our retreat. All mechanized units are to cover our retreat before going at top speed to the closest fortified spot. There you will be sent to the rear to rest while someone else will take over your vehicle.”
There was a general cheer from the troops at that order. Explosions which had so far only been seen faintly in the distance suddenly came a whole lot closer.
Chu Shen had heard the command because of his precise hearing however he suddenly became deafened. This was an unfortunate price to pay for his ability to absorb Qi again. The helmet no longer blocked sound, leaving him vulnerable to the explosions sound.
The abnormal scout saw Chu Shen stumble and became dazed. He was puzzled at first before quickly realizing the reason. Shaking his head, he flew down on his gravity boots and grabbed him, hauling him to the ship.
Five minutes after going to the hanger bay through the airlock, the ship started rumbling. They were taking off.
After a couple of seconds, the ship took off. The fortress they had built around them was made of self-replicating nanites. Unfortunately, after they took a shape, they couldn’t be disassembled making them a one-use item.
It shattered to pieces from the ship’s take off. Various bugs were blown back by the force of the take off. The heavy machinery fled backwards towards another position.
The ship flew as swiftly as possible but was hit by three small plasma balls anyway. A blue energy shield flared to life as the plasma hit. Its bright glare dimmed noticeably after blocking the plasma balls but the ship was undamaged.
The ship got out of range of the tanker bugs. It flew for about half an hour before landing at a large city. They flew over various smaller cities and other areas but they were all evacuated. This large city was where all the citizens of the planet.
If the line broke then all these people would die.

Back on the ship.
The abnormal scout helped Chu Shen to the medical bay. As they walked down the hallways many of the soldiers who saw both of them started clapping.
Chu Shen’s face glowed red with pride and embarrassment. He had never been admired like this before. Of course, at the academy most of the students acted like this but Chu Shen didn’t feel like he had earned praise. Now however he took pride in his accomplishments.
When they got to the medical bay there was no one else. If their suit had been punctured they were killed by the radiation. The suits protected them from everything else though.
Officer Hugh was waiting for them. He had of course heard reports on this miracle dwarf that was able to kill over a thousand bugs in hand to hand combat.
Upon seeing each other they both exclaimed aloud. “You!”
The abnormal scout set down Chu Shen on a bed, ignoring them. Then he took off his helmet, revealing a handsome young man with blonde hair.
The scout looked at the doctor. “Okay doc. Let’s hear this guy’s story. He seems kind of young to be on a military ship.”
Hugh sighed. “You know that heavy worlder kid we picked up some time ago.”
“Yeah. What does that have to do with anything?”
“That’s him.”
“What!?”
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 50 - Breakthrough</h1>
 
Chu Shen had on his scout armor and was currently inside of a small maintenance airlock leading out of the city. Why? Well because of the radiation shielding. With it in place he couldn’t possibly cultivate so he had to go outside.
After Leonard Maximus, the abnormal scout from Sparta, had brought him into the infirmary there had been a lot of questions. The hammer and where he got it from was one of them. Of course, since Leonard had mentioned a pocket dimension Chu Shen went with that explanation though they were skeptical.
Hugh had scanned him for radiation but found nothing. He of course couldn’t explain it but Chu Shen knew why. With his null Qi’s properties, of course the doctor found nothing. Afterwards he was told to get some rest and left alone.
Afterwards he snuck out of his room which was easy considering the fact that there were no guards. There were too many things to do to be a guard. Then he left to go outside leading to his current situation.
Chu Shen reached the end of the airlock and opened the door. Stepping outside he immediately closed the door and started running. He had looked at a map the A.I. had provided so he wasn’t running aimlessly.
After a while Chu Shen came across a deserted town. Unlike before where the town had a large dome around it this one had a small force field. Luckily it was shut down to divert power to where it was needed.
Chu Shen went into one of the houses and activated his comm device. He had asked the A.I. to contact him if the bug horde came close to the small town he had chosen.
With all that settled Chu Shen went into one of the abandoned houses and found a comfortable bed. Sitting down on it he started cultivating.
The danger of fighting and the knowledge of the vast hordes and powerful bugs that he had yet to fight put enormous pressure on him. That pressure brought out hidden potential in him. His soul started to grow, increasing his chances of breaking through.
Everyone knew that fighting was the best way to temper techniques since only by fighting could you adapt those techniques to combat. However, it was also true that when your life was on the line the body brought out everything it could to grow stronger. It was a rule of nature.
Life and death struggles not only honed techniques but also let the soul grow stronger and more mature.
As he cultivated he also went over what he had done in the fight mentally. Recalling the sensation of using the pistols he also pondered over the strange weaponry here.
At heart, he was still an artificer and since he saw the blueprint for it on the computer Chu Shen was fascinated with it. He started thinking of the applications using Qi instead which lead him on interesting paths.
For two days he stayed there, cultivating, and meditating in peace. Outside though it was becoming more and more desperate.
After the captain had landed the General in charge had told him to keep the civilian onboard. After a day went by the captain decided to check on the kid. Unfortunately, he was gone. A quick query revealed that the kid had left the ship and headed into the town.
Sighing the captain resigned himself to more important things. It was better to use available manpower to hold off the bugs then to hunt down a civilian that didn’t want protection.
Over the past two days the bugs had advanced closer and closer. Various elite soldiers had shown up on different ship’s. One had a cyborg powered by a fusion reactor. With it he could use heavy equipment like the laser cannon he had for an arm.
Another had a group of soldiers that had nanite injections. Using the nanites to construct various tools and to enhance themselves this elite unit killed many bugs. The best of all though was the ammo fabber two ships had brought.
With how many bugs there was, there was absolutely not enough ammo to deal with them. However, the fabbers produced ammo out of any material fed to it.
Using the waste products from the mining the colonists did they were able to provide enough ammo to hold off the bugs. Unfortunately, there was still not enough. They were pushed back by the vast hordes.
Closer and closer the bugs came to the lone bastion of human civilization on the planet. Soon there wasn’t going to be a human civilization if something didn’t change. Then it did.
A frigate dropped out of hyperspace. Apparently, the attack fleet had been attacked by pirates. As soon as they saw them they immediately sent a frigate ahead. The frigates had a faster hyperspace charge time and could enter before the pirates disrupted hyperspace.
To avoid the pirates the frigate had to make a detour in the hyperspace jump resulting in lost time. The frigate brought the news that the extra ships should be here in another day since the pirate group was not that big.
This was the reason for the delay. The frigate was capable of space to ground combat and readily bombarded the surface with lasers and plasma cannons. Unfortunately, since the Weapons of Mass Destruction Ban, nukes and other large scale destructive devices were not available.
The weapons on the frigate made up for it though. Using the weapons, the bugs were pushed back. Until the shield bugs and sniper bugs came out. The sniper bugs were not genetically bred but were cybernetic constructs.
They launched pieces of rock and metal at speeds that boggled the mind. The frigate could withstand that kind of blow but not with the numbers present. The shield bugs were another cybernetic construct that used force fields. They were rarely seen on the battlefield since the nanites were expensive to the K’ateesh.
This delay was crucial to the defenders. The bugs were now less than 3 kilometers away from the main city. They were also only 2 kilometers away from where Chu Shen was.
Suddenly a large fluctuation of energy surged from where Chu Shen was at. He was laughing as he ran out of the house.
“Hahahahaha! I did it! I finally did it! They said I couldn’t do it but I did! I even did it faster than they did! Ha! To all those who said I couldn’t advance take that! I have finally stepped into the Martial Realm! I might just be a Martial Student but just wait! I will surpass you all!”
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 51 - Fight!</h1>
 
Chu Shen was in the middle of an important process. Each person has 8 major meridians. However, the 1st major meridian was different. Rather than it being a single large meridian it was a collection of smaller meridians. This network together was called the first major meridian though it was more commonly known as the outer meridians.
Until the outer meridians were unblocked the other 7 major meridians could not be sensed normally. The meridians were located in these locations.
One on each leg, one on each arm, one on the head, two in the chest, and a collection of minor meridians below the skin, the meridians could be unblocked in any order however the minor meridians below the skin had to be unblocked first.
Each meridian had 10 blockages in it, resulting in the 10 levels. The outer meridians were the same in that each minor meridian had 10 blockages in it and breaking through those blockages advanced another level.
Chu Shen could feel he was getting closer to a breakthrough. His Qi was seething and boiling in his meridians. It was like a river that was trying to overflow its banks.
As he meditated Ti Wu came out of the Voids Hand. As he observed Chu Shen he knew it was time. Raising his hands, he absorbed some of the Void Qi in his outer meridians.
After he did Chu Shen could feel the existence of many tiny meridians besides his current ones. Manipulating the Qi in his body it flowed towards these new meridians
As it did his Qi came across something blocking its path. No matter what he did he couldn’t break through. Trying a new approach Chu Shen gathered all his Qi onto only one meridian and pushed forward. After he did he broke through the barrier. When he did the sudden surge of Qi caught him off guard.
Utilizing this surge of Qi, he pushed onwards towards the other branches. Eventually all the outer meridians were broken through. As he did a black smelling funk was pushed out of his body. This was impurities found in the body.
That was what he felt was blocking his meridians. As the surge of Qi rushed into him his dantian was filled. After it was filled the Qi started filling up his meridians.
As it did some of it inevitably overflowed and spilled into Chu Shen’s body, strengthening it. His strength went from 16,550 pounds to 30,000. In comparison to a normal cultivator it was insane! Their strength would normally reach 20,000 pounds! His body’s defense also reached new heights.
After a couple of seconds, his body seemed to hit a breaking point before suddenly his dantian grew over twice as big as before. With its increase, the overflowing Qi found a place to rest in. All of the Qi flowed into his dantian and settled down.
Chu Shen immediately controlled his Qi and made it leave his body. A clump of gray colored energy appeared before him in the palm of his hand. He just stared at it.
“Ha…Haha…hahahaha.” The Qi disappeared as Chu Shen started laughing. Images flashed by in his mind. Faces filled with pity, envy, and shame. Voices that told him why he was never going to reach his full potential. He laughed in the face of it all.
As he kept laughing he dashed out of the house.
“Hahahahaha! I did it! I finally did it! They said I couldn’t do it but I did! I even did it faster than they did! Ha! To all those who said I couldn’t advance take that! I have finally stepped into the Martial Realm! I might just be a Martial Student but just wait! I will surpass you all!”
Beep. Beep.
His comm set started going off. Most likely it was the bugs since Chu Shen had instructed the A.I. to contact him once they got within two kilometers of the small village he was in.
He smiled. Now that he had broken through, the bugs provided the perfect chance to hone his skills.
Of course, he couldn’t fight in this condition. He needed to stabilize his cultivation. Sitting down he focused on calming the still unstable Qi. After an hour, the Qi in his body stopped seething, becoming as calm as a lake.
Now that that was settled he could get started. Using his enhanced vision, Chu Shen immediately set off towards the bugs.
..................................................................................
Leonard Maximus was flying above the bugs. Hopper and winged insects flew towards him only to be shot out of the sky by his pistols. A tanker bug walked steadily towards the ship only for a bright red beam to slice it in half.
A half robot, half human man pointed his metallic arm towards another tanker bug. As it did another brilliant red beam to shoot out, slicing it in half.
Leonard shot out a black disk at a warrior bug. It looked like the drone bugs but were half the size of the tanker bug and as fast as the hoppers. It exploded, cracking its thick shell, and knocking it backwards. A quick shot to its brain ended its life.
Explosions went off in the distance as the artillery in the back supported them. Truly this was one of the last great efforts they could make. Until backup arrived, they had to holdout.
Suddenly there was a large explosion of dirt and bug parts as something smashed into the ground right in front of the fortress. It couldn’t have been the machines in the back since they were most definitely busy thinning their ranks.
Emerging from that crater was a smiling twelve-year-old kid holding an archaic black hammer.
...............................................................................................
Chu Shen couldn’t, of course, just run the entire way. In fact, he found a much faster and efficient method. Using his greatly increased muscles he jumped upwards, covering over 300 meters in a single jump. Taking the fall with his body he would once again jump.
As he approached the bug horde he saw new species of bugs were attacking. These ones were big, fast, and apparently a little smarter since they were actively attacking threats instead of attacking everything. Timing his jump just right Chu Shen jumped towards the middle of a group of the warrior bugs.
Using the momentum of his landing he withdrew his hammer from his ring. The [Earth Shattering Inscription] had grown much stronger with his increase of Qi. Swinging his weapon downward the massive blow shook the ground.
The shock-wave alone killed the closest warrior bugs while the rest were blown backwards. Standing up Chu Shen surveyed their situation. The bugs were coming closer, not even hesitating. Some interesting people such as the ones with silver skin or the one with a metal arm were close by.
Jumping upwards he landed near the abnormal scout, Leonard Maximus, who swooped down next to him. “Hello senior brother Leonard.” Chu Shen said respectfully and bowed.
Leonard smiled ruefully, truly this kid was an enigma. “Hey Chu Shen. It looked like you abandoned us when you up and left like that.”
Chu Shen shook his head. “No. I would never. It is the duty of every human to ensure that normal people are kept safe from primordial beasts. I was merely having a breakthrough to become stronger, that is what kept me from joining you.”
Leonard just shook his head. ‘I think the translator botched that one up.’ “Anyways, these bugs need to be put down. Think you can help?” He asked while raising an eyebrow.
“Of course. Let us fight!” Chu Shen brandished his hammer as he spoke.
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 52 - How Is That Possible?</h1>
 
“Of course. Let us fight!”
As Chu Shen eagerly said these words, Leonard smiled. “Of course.” He replied and immediately shot off into the air.
Chu Shen grinned himself and took off towards the bugs. He started hitting the warrior bugs with his hammer. The warrior bugs were big and their armored exoskeleton was incomparable to the drone bugs from earlier. However, with Chu Shen’s increased power, they were smashed to bits.
He smashed left, and right, left, and right. Chu Shen was even faster than before. Whereas earlier Leonard could tell what he was doing, now it was all a blur. Chu Shen once again withdrew the pistols and started using them to great effect.
Suddenly, a red beam of energy shot out, drawing his attention. Sure, there had been energy beams before, but they were all directed towards the ever-encroaching army of bugs. The energy beam lanced out, piercing through several bugs before disappearing into the distance.
Looking over he saw a man with skin made of metal. His right arm was a metal cylinder and his back had a slight bulge to it. It was the cyborg. Chu Shen nodded to the cyborg, grateful for the support.
He ran forward, towards a tanker bug. Swinging his hammer, he hit it on the side. Before, Chu Shen only cracked the outer shell. Now he could do way more than that. His weapon could now increase its weight by over 100 times now, and he had over 30,000 pounds of force in his hands.
The hammer hit the tanker bug’s shell. It passed through the shell, cracks spread out over the large exoskeleton where the hammer had impacted it. The hammer passed through the inside of the bug and the handle ripped a line through the shell as he swung.
The hammer completed its swing and blew a second hole through its exoskeleton as it exited its body. As blood, along with various pieces of the exoskeleton and its organs gushed out of the hole, the tanker bug let out a loud screech.
Chu Shen leapt back the second his hammer was freed from the tanker bug. Leaping sideways he swung with his hammer as he passed the bugs head. His hammer blew right through it as he soared past, on his way to fight some different bug.
He fought for a while with various warrior bugs before he suddenly stopped. Running forward towards the front of the fort he faced the horde of bugs. It wasn’t just a small group of ten or so like he fought on the honeycomb styled fort. It was a swarm of a couple hundred.
Chu Shen grinned as he started circulating his Qi. Willing his Qi out of his body, he released a large surge of energy. Qi could come in all sorts of shapes and type. There was a basic form of Qi called blade Qi. This Qi is thin and sharp, able to cut through various things.
However, compared to a real sword wielders Qi it was incomparable. Using his Qi, he released a surge of sharp blade Qi. It surged forward in a crescent wave. Honestly if he was facing a fellow cultivator on the same level as him, he would have never done so.
Such an attack was too easily blocked and wasted far too much energy. However, these were not cultivators and could be considered slightly stronger than normal animals. Against such things, an attack like this was the best since it took out large swathes of them at once.
The Qi shot outwards, slicing practically all of them in half. Leonard’s instruments picked up a large surge of energy. Expecting it to be some sort of new bug he quickly flew towards the front of the fort. The fort had a huge pile of corpses laid out in front of it.
Every single one was cut in half. The top half slid off a couple tanker bugs as he watched. Standing in front of the fort was a single kid. It was Chu Shen. Leonard had thought that nothing this kid could do would stun him.
He was wrong.
The best thing he could think of that could do this kind of damage was an energy blade. But it couldn’t be. Those were expensive for one thing. For another they were short range, maybe a couple of feet but most definitely not how far he was seeing.
He thought of another possibility. Maybe an energy wave cannon. Most of the time it was just a surge of energy that burned or knocked down everything in its path.
It was of course possible to modulate it so that it would become a large blade but that kind of modification, along with the gun itself, was as expensive as buying a house! How could the kid of a colonist have that kind of money? Then again, what about the pocket dimension. Those things were really expensive too, expensive enough to buy some asteroids or a dwarf planet!
As he was thinking of this the bugs continued marching forward. It looked like a solid carpet of bugs. Except for the large holes where the tanks had blown holes in the formation.
Leonard started killing them immediately. Suddenly there was a massive energy release. Looking down he saw a surge of gray colored energy shooting forward. The bugs were sliced in half as soon as that energy passed through them.
Leonard couldn’t believe it. This energy, it was just like the energy wave cannon. He had speculated but he thought he was just making wild speculations.
Chu Shen frowned as the energy shot outwards. This was too costly. A single energy wave cost him five percent of his energy. While this didn’t seem to be a lot, if he used it just 20 times he would be out of energy. The bugs were endless.
He started recreating that blade wave. But this time instead of releasing it like a blast of energy he held it in front of him. Of course, the energy would still dissipate but not as rapidly as if he just let it loose. It also tired him mentally as he had to use his soul to carefully control the Qi so it didn’t just dissipate the second he released it. As the energy created a crescent wave in front of him he started running forward.
As he did his null Qi started to absorb the Qi from the air. As he ran the crescent blade in front of him grew stronger. Any bug that encountered that wave of energy was sliced to bits.
Chu Shen ran and ran, killing over a thousand bugs easily. As he did he thought to himself. ‘Truly, a peak Dragon Stage warrior cannot compete with even the weakest Martial Student cultivator.’
Leonard was once again confused beyond belief. The energy wave gun wasn’t acting normal at all. Now the energy wave was suspended in front of Chu Shen. And he was using it to just run the bugs over?!
This was impossible!!
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 53 - The End Game</h1>
 
Chu Shen wiped out thousands of bugs. He was actually able to kill more bugs with one move than the tanks in the back. But he couldn’t be everywhere at once. Soon his group was the only ones that could still hold their position.
After another three hours, the retreat came to a stop. This was their last line of defense. If they didn’t hold out then the entire population, along with them, would be wiped out. Chu Shen and his fort stayed where they were, to be the vanguard for the defense.
They tried their best but it wasn’t going to be enough. A wave of tanker bugs attacked Chu Shen’s fort. This time instead of rushing forward they spurted plasma at the group.
Chu Shen saw this and reacted immediately. Because of his null Qi he could absorb Qi from the atmosphere quickly so his energy was at about 97 percent. He circulated his Qi, activating the <Universe Shield>.
A circular gray shield appeared in front of the fort. It was a wavery, almost water like gray and Chinese characters were inscribed on it in a darker shade of gray. The whole thing was basically transparent. Chu Shen had studied the skill but never practiced it, resulting in him having a weak grasp on it. It was really only an image of Qi. If it was the real thing it would be solid, showing the resonance of the Qi as it became more perfect or more energy was channeled into it. As it was he could barely use it to block an attack equal to himself otherwise he could fight above his level depending upon just this shield.
The bright blue plasma balls hit the shield. Three hit the shield in a row before five impacted it together. At first the shield only flashed as it became opaquer, a result of the energy being absorbed into it. But when the five plasma balls hit it immediately shattered as a large hole was burned through it.
The plasma balls were not quite as bright as they were before but they were still headed for the ship. As it did Chu Shen had a panicked expression on his face. He had truly underestimated these bugs.
The plasma balls combined attack was like a fire-attribute Martial General warrior. There was no way he could block that.
Honestly it was a miracle that Chu Shen had weakened it and that was only possible because the plasma did not arrive all at once. With that his null Qi could absorb the energy and strengthen it before the others arrived.
He now only had 57 percent of his strength left. The <Universe Shield> took about forty percent of his energy to activate. Gritting his teeth Chu Shen once again activated the shield. This time he also deactivated the energy blade and focused all his attention on the incoming plasma ball.
The shield once again appeared before him, but this time it was smaller and its form was more solid. Chu Shen manipulated his shield so that he could concentrate its energy on a smaller spot.
Once again, the plasma balls hit the shield. It flared and became gradually solid as the plasma impacted the martial art. After a couple of seconds, it was no longer like a translucent outline but rather like a giant was holding a shield in front of them.
The plasma was eventually absorbed. The shield stayed there as Chu Shen collapsed in exhaustion. He managed to forcefully keep himself awake and stared at the incoming bugs.
The tanker bugs fired another salvo after twenty more tanker bugs joined them. The combined attack made the shield flicker but it stayed put. Leonard along with the nanite squad went out and attacked the tanker bugs. The cyborg ran to Chu Shen and grabbed him.
He was placed over the cyborgs shoulders as the cyborg ran away. Leonard and the nanite squad suddenly ran back towards them. The ship unearthed itself and troops started boarding, just like Chu Shen had before with Leonard.
The cyborg jumped inside a hovercraft that flew down. The pilot flew the hovercraft backwards towards the defense line. They had lost the support of the tanks some time ago since they could have been flanked from the sides once their line collapsed.
Fortunately, they had Chu Shen who replaced the tanks and thinned the horde considerably. Chu Shen and they cyborg flew over hordes of bugs. The hovercraft banked left as it avoided a plasma ball. They flew over their defensive line and landed behind it.
Chu Shen had recovered enough to stand and walk after the short flight. Shrugging off the help of the cyborg he got out of the hovercraft and jumped on top of the ship’s defensive structure.
The comm attached to his shoulder automatically switched him to the local soldier’s channel when it sensed their comms. “WOOOHOOO” “YEAH, BLOW THOSE BUGS TO KINGDOM COME.” “COME ON, ROAST THOSE COCKROACHES.”
He was taken aback by all the sudden screaming on the channel. Normally it was the officers giving orders, or people asking for help. Now it was full of joyous yells. But he soon saw the reason why.
BOOM BWOOM PSEEEW
Explosions sounded off in the distance. Turning he saw large explosions and lights plow through the remaining bugs. The sky was ripped apart as missiles and energy beams flew to the ground from orbit.
Chu Shen was finally able to get an answer as to where the fire was coming from. Space. It was finally here. The reinforcements.
They rained fire down upon the bug swarms, eliminating them in vast swathes. When they arrived they immediately destroyed the various anti-space type bugs first. Then they rained down death on the birthing bugs, destroying their hope for swarming the planet.
Of course, it didn’t end things there. Afterwards they destroyed the bugs in the open and the troops were sent to scout for hidden bugs. The colonists knew they were saved and that it was only time until they could return to their normal lives.
Everything was looking up.
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 54 - Ancient Race</h1>
 
Chu Shen couldn’t help with any of the cleanup. The general found out about a civilian running into the fray, especially a kid, and threw a fit. Of course, he was soothed by the fact that he could more than hold his own.
The general had a lot of questions about how this kid could do what he did. Curious didn’t even begin to describe it. This kid, picked up from a backwards colony world, could destroy thousands of bugs. That was more than even his own unit could!
The more the thought about it the more the general wanted to meet this weird kid. Chu Shen had gone back to his room after the reinforcements had arrived and was inside for two hours.
He mostly spent the time meditating, reflecting upon the battles. He was definitely not happy with himself. His Qi control was sloppy and leaked everywhere. Some leakage was impossible to avoid but he was using almost twice the Qi it normally required.
He was too slow and didn’t have enough awareness. Several times he barely dodged death at the last second. Especially with the plasma blasts. He frowned. Chu Shen had truly underestimated them this time.
The main reason he underestimated them was because he had never taken one of the blasts head on. For some reason, they never fired the huge plasma bombs. If they had Chu Shen would have been more prepared than before.
As he kept reflecting off those mistakes a chime sounded. It was coming from a wall on his cabin. “Computer, what was that noise?”
“That was the room’s messaging system. Would you like me to read the message aloud?”
Chu Shen nodded. “Yes please.”
“Acknowledged. Message as follows.” The computer changed voices. Now it was a deep but smooth voice. “I am General Irving of the UBF. I have seen the recordings of your exploits on the field and would like to… Hold on. He’s just a kid. He won’t understand that. Okay now how do you delete it? I can never really figure these things out. Uhhh… Here it is.”
“End of message.” The computer’s voice was back to normal. Chu Shen was really confused now. What was that all about? After about ten minutes there was a knock on the door.
He went over and opened it. Standing there was a broad-shouldered man in a military uniform and a buzzcut. The man nodded at him. “Hey kid. The general wants to have some lunch with you. Nothing fancy just a little thank you for what you’ve done. Do you want to come?”
Chu Shen figured this was what the man that had messaged him was going to ask him. He nodded. “Yeah. I’m feeling kinda hungry.”
“Great. Follow me.” The guard left and headed towards the roof. Once there they arrived next to a hovercar. It was like a hovercraft but was built for luxury and was decorated. Clearly it was ornamental.
They got in and flew towards the center of the compound. Inside the compound there was huge celebrations going on. The miners were all out celebrating for all they were worth. And, why wouldn’t they?
It looked like they were all going to die but here they were, not even one of them dead. Their mining operations weren’t even damaged. Once the bugs were completely gone they could start mining immediately.
Of course, they were saddened by the soldiers passing and honored their sacrifice. But that was it. They didn’t know them and wouldn’t grieve too much.
Chu Shen flew over the celebration. Looking down on all the happy faces, he wished he could be down there as well. He sighed. Sometimes being a martial artist was just too awful.
Soon they reached a small out of the way restaurant. Outside the restaurant there was three soldiers in a parade uniform and inside there was only a middle-aged man in non-descript casual clothes with a buzzcut eating a cheeseburger. (Chu Shen didn’t know what it was until he picked up a menu.)
The hovercar landed in front of the store and Chu Shen and the soldier got out. The soldier saluted towards the middle-aged man, who he assumed was the general, before taking up position on a bench across from the restaurant.
Chu Shen came in and walked to the generals table. The general smiled at him and put down his cheeseburger. “Hi, I’m General Irving of the UBF. Go ahead and sit down I just wanted to discuss with you a couple things.”
“Okay.” Chu Shen replied simply and sat down. He picked up a menu and ordered a cheeseburger, the same as the general. As he waited for his order to arrive the general just looked at him.
After his cheeseburger arrived a second one arrived for the general. They both sat down and ate their burgers. Chu Shen was startled at the flavor of the cheeseburger.
It was salty, and juicy. It was beyond what he had ever tasted. Nothing he had even thought of tasted this good. He took a second bite and just savored it with a sort of childish glee. The general saw his look and smiled.
It couldn’t be helped. When such an innocent looking kid smiled in such a cute way it was like an angel descending from heaven. Chu Shen eventually ate the rest of the Cheeseburger and then looked at his plate in disappointment. He licked his fingers in sadness, trying to get another taste.
Chuckling, the general ordered Chu Shen another hamburger while he sipped some water. After he finished the burger off they waited in a kind of unbreakable silence.
Finally, the general’s curiosity got the best off him. “So. Your name is Chu Shen, right?”
Chu Shen nodded. “Yes, my name is Chu Shen general. Thank you for the cheeseburgers.”

“Your welcome. Anyways Chu Shen, I just wanted to ask you one question. Are you one of the ancient races?”
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 55 – Civilization</h1>
 
Chu Shen looked at the general for a second before shaking his head. “What is an ancient race?” He asked with a puzzled look.
The general had a disappointed look. “Sigh. It’s nothing. Just some wild rumors really. Supposedly there are ancient beings that can accomplish anything. They can manipulate time and space, the very fabric of reality. They’re supposed to be nearly immortal and capable of controlling the energy around them.”
After the general explained what he meant Chu Shen nodded. “Thank you general for the explanation but I am truly not one of the ancient race. So, what’s going to happen to me. Everyone seemed concerned that I was on the ship so I guess I am not going back there.”
It seemed that he may not be the only cultivator in this realm. It was best to stay low and try to not provoke anyone, lest they turn out be an expert.
“It’s true that bringing you here to the frontlines was not the best idea but it was the only option your ship’s captain had. If you agree we will provide you with transport to the closest civilized station around here. Along with the transport we can give you a couple thousand credits, enough to live comfortably for a long time. It's a thank you for what you did for us and an apology for bringing you into this fight."
“Okay, is it all right to join the party outside then if we are done then?” Chu Shen’s eager face gave him away.
The general laughed at the kid’s expression. “Haha. Of course, of course. Who am I to stop a kid’s chance of fun? Go on then, enjoy the celebration!” He shooed him towards the door with a large smile.
Chu Shen quickly left and ran down the street. The guard on the bench and the hovercar were long gone. He joined the crowd and enjoyed himself. He tasted the wonderful food and listed to the strange, yet beautiful, music they had.
Life was good.
…………………………………………………………
Two days later he was reclining in a chair when he felt a small jolt. Just as he was wondering what it was a blue screen popped up in front of him along with a short beep. He read the message.
They had arrived.
It was just like the general promised. First, he gave Chu Shen a genetic scan and registered him with the Galactic Bank. It was a company that was founded by the alien races that were already amongst the stars. It had deep roots and used credits, the common currency of the galaxy.
Now all he had to do was wave his hand above a gene reader to pay, or withdraw credits from the bank. Because it was based on his genetics, it was impossible to fake or steal his money.
They paid him well for his services. 4,851 credits worth to be precise. It was originally going to be 3,000 but the townspeople heard of him and gave him a pleasant surprise.
Now he was on his way to civilization. Chu Shen was absolutely fascinated with technology, as they called it here. On his world, everyone was obsessed with cultivation related crafts. But here they focused on building without using anything related to Qi at all.
No formations, no heavenly material, beast cores, none of it. Instead they found a way to build things capable of harnessing Qi all by itself in various forms. As an artificer, he was naturally curious.
So, he was going to the most technologically advanced place possible. Sparta. There they had the best in medical, entertainment, and war technology. Their entire society was based off war. Defensive war, but war nonetheless.
There was a knock on the door. “Hey kid, we’ve arrived. Get ready because we’re going to be leaving in about ten minutes.”
“Thanks, I’ll be ready.” Chu Shen called back. It was Leonard Maximus. After hearing that he was leaving for Sparta he decided to travel with him. He said he was going back to his home world anyways so taking him along wasn’t a problem.
Chu Shen grabbed his small bag of clothes. He didn’t need to carry it but if he showed up in different clothes then questions would be asked. No one needed to know all his secrets.
He stepped outside and closed the door. Leonard stood there in a red polo with blue jeans on. He himself was dressed in a T-Shirt with the words PWN’ED in bright green lettering with frayed blue jeans on. He looked like an average kid.
“Ready, Shen?” Leonard had taken to calling him that. He explained that he felt awkward saying his full name all the time.
He nodded. “I am. Let’s go.”
It had been easy. The ship Chu Shen had been on took them to a nearby station within 5 hours. Afterwards they went to a transfer station. These huge stations opened portals to a corresponding station somewhere else.
Unfortunately, each station used up vast amounts of energy to be opened even once. It was expensive and the UBF couldn’t afford the cost to transport their ships en-mass, plus the fact that they weren’t very far off anyways meant FTL transportation was limited to hyperdrives.
Leonard rented a two person skimmer, a personal transport that looked like a hovercar only good for low distance travels. It was common practice to rent skimmers for trips through transfer stations where there was a corresponding skimmer lot.
The skimmer business was owned by a single man named Henry Jehosha, making him one of the richest men in the human’s galaxy. They got on the skimmer and rode towards the portal. It was a fairly small ring only meant for the skimmers.
There was a much larger ring available for cargo transports but they were much more expensive than the one they were going through. Chu Shen watched out the window in amazement at the sights.
Ahead of them the ring lit up with a blue glow as a small blue vortex appeared in the very center. Soon it spread to fill the entire ring, the very outsides appeared turbulent and chaotic. The skimmer shot through the portal and immediately the blue vortex disappeared without a trace.
This happened five times before it was their turn. One skimmer behind the one crossing tried to move forward but was bounced backwards by a barrier that shimmered red. Obviously a forcefield was keeping them from crossing illegally.
The machine started up. As Chu Shen observed the opening of the whirlpool he started comparing it to the Thousand Miles Formation that he knew of. They were both different and alike.

They crossed through the vortex. A cold sensation ran across his spine, causing him to have goosebumps. Then they were through.
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 56 - Sparta</h1>
 
Chu Shen had only one word to describe the sight in front of him. Boring. There was nothing here but lines! After they emerged from the portal they were in a line on the other side.
They waited for almost an hour in the little skimmer with nothing to do but wait. Sparta was indeed a very advanced place but it was also very sensitive as well. If one of their enemies got ahold of some of their secrets it could spell disaster for the galaxies future.
Because of this, security was very tight. Everyone was scanned several times by specialized equipment. They were even put through truth scanners and asked if they meant to steal, spy, or otherwise harm anyone on Sparta.
Chu Shen didn’t have any problems with the security. Even the truth scanners weren’t a problem. After all, he was here to simply learn about their technology. And that didn’t include their most advanced technology that they kept secret either.
Rather, he merely wanted to experiment with a couple of things. At heart, he wasn’t a martial artist. Instead he was an artificer. His Dao, his path of cultivation, wasn’t centered upon fighting but rather construction.
After they finally got out of the security, Leonard led him to a shuttle where they flew down to the planet. As they approached Chu Shen felt an enormous pressure. He sensed a source of power so immense that he could barely stand up.
He looked outside the shuttles windows for the source of power. Then he saw it.
It was a large jewel. It hung there, just floating in the void of space. It had splotches of blue and vast swathes of green, white, and orange. Black dots speckled the landscape.
Chu Shen knew what it was. It was Sparta, in all its glory. Sparta was a vast planet with gravity over 10 times that of earth. It was a huge planet. Contained within was many different climates, all of them harsher than the norm.
There were the scorching deserts, the freezing tundra, and the tropical forests were all inhospitable to humans. Or rather regular humans. The enhanced Spartans could easily handle the various climates and tremendous gravity.
Despite how big it was, because of the colonization effort, the atmospheric pressure was equal to Earth’s. Disregarding this, the gravity itself was enough to reduce a normal human to a bloody pulp.
The black dots Chu Shen could see was cities and training facilities. All of these together made up the huge planet called Sparta. However, none of these things captured his attention.
Oh no, what really captured his gaze was the shimmering yellow field that surrounded the planet. It was hazy and almost completely transparent. He gaped in astonishment.
This. This was. AMAZING!!!
A formation that used the universal laws! Qi, when circulated in certain ways or interacting with certain materials could interact with the universal laws. These laws made the Qi not only stronger and more powerful, it could even have some mysterious effects and allow the manipulation of the universe itself.
Chu Shen had previously considered these people as barely having any great accomplishments. Their personal strength was horrendous and their machines barely let them have any combat capabilities. Of course, they had some powerful machines but they weren’t in abundance. But this changed everything!
As an Artificer, he was experienced in arrays and inscriptions. There was barely any difference between the two though. The difference being an inscription affected a weapon, while an array effected the surrounding area and people.
Using his experience in arrays he instantly knew that what was being used to set up the array. It was the hundreds of large black balls hanging in the space between the planet and the array. As Chu Shen marveled at the huge and powerful array Leonard saw his amazement.
Coming over Leonard looked out the shuttle window. “It’s a beautiful sight, isn’t it?” Chu Shen nodded, though what he was admiring was the complex array and not the tinted shield.
“It’s one of a kind. Sparta was made over 500 years ago by the early wave of human settlers. Honestly, they were scientists who were fleeing persecution by religious zealots. They landed here and successfully colonized the planet. They adapted themselves to be able to live here.”
“All they really wanted was to be able to research in peace but they knew they had to protect themselves after what happened earlier. Knowing their fate if the Pure Ones found them they created an army of clones, training them to be the best. “
“Of course, after they found out the Pure Ones were destroyed they established trade routes with the rest of the galaxy. They still have the clone army, though the size has been said to have been reduced.”
“They made many of the technological breakthroughs we use today and still lead humanity in science. This forcefield is the only Class 9 planetary shield to date. It can even make the entire planet intangible.”
“There’s nothing anyone can do to destroy it. They even made the shield modulate the sun’s rays to be yellow instead of red, so they can remember how the sun looked on Earth.”
Chu Shen had an astonished look on his face when he heard this. Intangible? This effect could be accomplished through ghost or spatial laws, both of which were rare.
This shield, if it could be replicated, was undoubtedly a great treasure!! Estimating by the strength of it, it was as powerful as a barrier made by a Nature Stage Cultivator!
Chu Shen sighed and shook his head. There was no way he could ever discover how this array worked. Obviously, it was a well-kept secret otherwise it would not be ‘one of a kind’. If they wouldn’t let him, then Chu Shen wouldn’t snatch it. Even if he wanted to, he didn’t have the capability.
It was best to dismiss such idle thoughts. Instead he focused on the beautiful sight in front of him. He stared at it as they gradually approached the array, sighing at the grandeur of it.
Eventually they reached the array. The shuttle came to a stop before a hazy blue glow appeared around it, much like the yellow one around the planet. The hazy glow was the signature of a forcefield. The shuttle slowly moved forward, merging with the forcefield.
It went through the forcefield. After it did the view of Sparta was unblocked. The shuttle swiftly accelerated towards the planet. It approached a section of the planet that was covered in dense forest and was right by the sea.
The shuttle slowed to halt above a large black building. The entire thing was just like a giant black brick. There were no decorations, just a large square building.
One end of the building opened to receive the shuttle. Soon after the shuttle descended, landing inside a fairly large hangar that was brightly lit. After it landed the occupants, including Chu Shen and Leonard, were escorted off the shuttle.
The reason why it landed here instead of on the planet or one of its cities was simple really. Safety. Everywhere else the cities were not protected. The gravity would kill anyone who was not protected.

Here they were asked whether they could cope with the gravity or they would give them personal anti-gravity devices. With it they could survive the planet’s harsh gravity.
 
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 57 - A Warrior’s Soul</h1>
 
They went through the legal procedure at the visitor’s center where he was vouched for by Leonard and had to sign a waiver stating they were aware of the risks the planet imposed. Afterwards they left inside a small skimmer.
Apparently, all those black dots Chu Shen had seen weren’t cities. Those were just research facilities and defense platforms that were scattered all over the planet.
Surprisingly enough for a planet that was supposed to be most technologically advanced in the known galaxy, there was very little technology on display. Instead they tried to preserve most of the planet as a natural habitat.
Most of the cities were spread on the large oceans, deserts, or even floating above the ground. The biggest facilities however were on the three moons of Sparta. Located there was most of the factories they used to make their specialized products. There was also many off world companies that helped to fulfill the orders that Sparta had.
The city Chu Shen wanted to go to was a fairly large town over the ocean. There he planned to use the rest of his credits to buy a small house and live there while studying the technology.
Previously he had looked at some of it onboard the ship but that was honestly just a glance. He only knew what they were and what they did. Nothing more, nothing less.
He had informed Leonard of his plan and he agreed to it. Leonard decided to help him get everything set up before they parted ways. After all, he lived here before and had some catching up to do with old friends and family.
The skimmer landed at the large town of Thermopylae. It was a large metal disk over a couple hundred meters in diameter filled to the brim with large towers. Some of those towers were 30-40 stories tall! Normally the disk would sink under the weight but the antimatter fueled gravity repulsors kept them afloat.
After they arrived Leonard kept his word and helped him find a person willing to sell their apartment. Apparently, there were no individual houses within this dense urban floating landscape. Instead many of the tall buildings were in fact apartment buildings.
Chu Shen bought a small one-person apartment. Of course, he couldn’t buy an apartment legally so he had Leonard buy it for him and then paid him back. It wasn’t technically illegal for him to live there by himself so long as there was an AI program.
The apartment though came complete with its own environment system. It included a small fusion bottle, water, and waste recycling along with a food processor, all state of the art.
He bought it for 800 credits which was actually a little expensive according to Leonard. For comparison, a single meal is usually 10 micro-credits. Each credit is worth 100 micro-credits, meaning Chu Shen bought the small apartment for exactly 80,000 micro-credits.
The average cost for such an apartment was 70,000, meaning there was a difference of 100 credits, an incredible difference really since a small interstellar spaceship cost 1000 credits.
Ignoring the price, Chu Shen was happy with his new home. It was on the very top floor, apartment number 2049, floor 20. His house consisted of a small kitchen/dining room combo, a living room, small bedroom, and an office.
After they inspected the house and bought it, Leonard helped Chu Shen buy a couple of things. A tablet, house AI, biomass used for the food processor, recipes, holo-projector, furniture, and some decorations were most of the things they bought.
Afterwards Leonard helped him set up a series of learning programs which he uploaded to the AI. He stayed for another week until he confirmed Chu Shen could live by himself. After leaving behind his contact number he left to visit his family.
Chu Shen waved goodbye as the skimmer took off, silent but the sound of air being cut through by the aerodynamic car. After he left Chu Shen sighed in relief.
“Finally, I can get to work!” This entire time he had been repressing himself to appear like a normal kid, or at least, mostly normal. Chu Shen walked back to the office and opened the learning programs.
Immediately he started flipping pages and looking at mathematical formulas as he began to learn in earnest. The pages were displayed for only a couple of seconds before they flipped. In that couple of seconds Chu Shen saw everything that was on the page, memorized it, and then completed any problems on it.
Within an hour he immediately completed all the math up to a high schoolers level. After that he slowed down slightly. It might seem outrageous but actually it was quite normal. A martial artist was extremely fast upon breaking through to the Martial Realms. It wasn’t just their bodies though.
Their perception of the world around them shifted as well. Their brains abilities such as memory and computing was multiple times better than before. Mostly due to the soul. The soul was the lifeblood of martial artists and everything was directly or indirectly related to it.
The soul was what allowed a cultivator to control Qi and manipulate. A genius was someone whose soul grew at a faster rate than others. Because of the soul growing, a person would be able to control more Qi than before.
That was the reason using beast cores and pills to advance was dangerous. If their soul wasn’t strong enough to control the Qi then it might become unstable and destroy their internal organs. Instead it was mostly used to replenish lost energy or to heal wounds.
Of course, those with special constitutions like our dear Chu Shen here was an exception. Qi was a foreign substance to the body and had to be forced into it with the soul. But those with special constitutions did not have to forcefully control Qi, instead it willingly did as it was guided to do.
This meant that unlike other people who had to worry about foundations and having absolute control over their Qi, Chu Shen only had to worry whether his body could handle the amount of energy.
The ways to cultivate the soul were simple. Enduring through hardship, learning, being pressured by outside means, or life and death situations. It was also found that the period the soul grows the most is during the first 8-30% of the warrior’s lifespan.
It normally would be ages 8-30 but as a warrior became more accomplished in the martial path then their lifespan would become longer. As a result, the period of soul growth also expanded. While no one knows why this happened, it was widely accepted and taken advantage of.
Chu Shen studied day in and day out. Taking breaks every now and then to eat and rest. One couldn’t be busy all the time or they would eventually break down. He couldn’t cultivate though.
It made sense, especially when Qi was lethal to humans in this realm. Every time he thought of this he sighed, he was missing out on a lot of cultivation time. ‘Oh well, everything comes at a price’. Such was Chu Shen’s thoughts on the matter.
What was really odd was the fact that Master Ti Wu did not talk to him at all. Not even a peep was heard from him in the period that he used studying. Unbeknownst to him was the fact that it wasn’t that Master Ti Wu didn’t want to talk to him, but rather he couldn’t.
Master Ti Wu had not saved up a lot of energy to not hold his disciple back. Unfortunately, he was not aware that Chu Shen couldn’t cultivate here. While he was researching a couple of things inside the Voids Hand’s library the entire library flickered.
Realizing that the power was starting to run out, Master Ti Wu tried to find out the problem. After he realized it he started to immediately curse himself and his foolish disciple.
Normally using the library wasn’t a drain on the power stored because the Voids Hand used surrounding Qi to power it. Since there was no Qi surrounding it, it started using up the stored power.

Now there was barely enough to keep him alive since he was like a leech inside the library. There wasn’t even enough energy to send a message to Chu Shen! Otherwise he could have him give some energy. So, with great reluctance he went into a deep slumber, cursing his disciple’s foolishness all the while.
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 58 - Weird Old Man</h1>
 
Chu Shen sighed as he leaned back in his chair. “Ahh. Finally finished. I can’t believe how complicated it is.” Seven months. This was how long Chu Shen spent learning.
He not only learned math but also scientific theory, physics, robotics, engineering, and other such things, all of it entwined together to create a categorized and defined perception of the universe.
Honestly it was really amazing. As far as utilizing their surroundings they were geniuses. Unfortunately, they lacked understanding of other factors. They couldn’t detect certain forms of energy such as elemental Qi.
Compared to his own universe this one lacked some basic types of Qi. Water, earth, and air Qi was really lacking. Fire, lightning, and ice Qi were found though. Pure examples of these types of Qi would be the sun, plasma, and absolute zero.
Honestly it was because of the vast amounts of Yang Qi that lead to such a thing. The concentration of Yang was multiple times more than his own. Of course, he knew that Yin and Yang were the basic buildings block of the universe but that was only when it was balanced.
Here there were vast amounts of Yang Qi, but Yin Qi seemed to be barely there. Solitary Yang leads to death as everyone knows. It might explain the reason why all the life here was found only on planets that shielded themselves from Qi.
By blocking Yang Qi, the small amounts of Yin and Yang Qi that still managed to get through could create a sort of balance on the planet. Thus, leading to life being formed where Qi was so thin that it barely passed the ability to make life.
Of course, that was his only his theorization based on his understanding of Qi in his realm. It could just be different realms rules as Master Ti Wu had told him.
Knock Knock
Chu Shen looked up with cheese and tomato sauce dripping down his face. He was in the middle of eating some pizza, another one of his favorite foods since he discovered it.
‘Eh, it’s probably Leonard. Kinda weird though, he usually calls.’ He got up and walked to the door with the intention to open it. Previously Leonard had visited him a couple of times though he always called him.
He started to open the door but just as it cracked open it was shoved open with gusto, causing him to fall backwards. Rushing into his home was a person who could only be described with one word.
Weird!
It was an old man with white hair that stuck up everywhere. He had on blue jeans, a red polo, and a lab coat on as well. Splotches of color, food stains, and encrusted objects decorated all his clothes and some of his hair was discolored as well.
Chu Shen wasn’t as surprised at this as he was the fact that he had been pushed backwards. Even if he was caught by surprise he was still very strong! But this person still pushed him backwards! He was most definitely wary of his uninvited guest.
The weird old man had a tablet clutched in his left hand. He was staring at the tablet without even looking at Chu Shen. He tapped it with his right hand. “Come on, come on. I know you’re here…. yes! There it is.”
Immediately he walked down the hallway towards Chu Shen’s office. Chu Shen stared at the man flabbergasted. This was completely unexpected! Who barged into someone’s home looking for something and didn’t even say hello?
Helplessly he followed the weird old man to his office. Once the weird old man was inside he completely ignored the desk and the holo-projector. Instead he went over to a side of his office and stopped there. He tapped his tablet for a second and waited.
Suddenly a small panel on the wall popped off, shocking Chu Shen. Inside the panel was a black cube. The weird old man pulled a cable out of his pocket. Plugging the cable into his tablet and then the black cube, he sat down in front of Chu Shen’s desk.
The weird old man cracked his fingers as he stared at the tablet’s screen. “It has been a minute but here goes.” His fingers turned into a blur that Chu Shen could barely see. He was astonished.
This old man was just too weird. First, he actually pushed Chu Shen backwards. Now he could move so fast that his hands were a blur even to him. A strange sense of danger came over him, like when he fought the bugs. This person was most certainly not your average crazy man.
Ding
“Aha! I knew a low-level AI couldn’t stand up to me!” The weird old man exclaimed excitedly at the sound. “Alright, let’s see just what it is that darned calculator dragged me out here for.
Started seven months ago. Trigonometry done, hyperphysics calculation done, basic engineering module done with no physical examples completed, advanced engineering module the same, spatial physics with simulations done, bla bla bla bla bla. Basically, everything related to physical tech or cybernetics completed within seven months from a basic elementary skill level.”
Chu Shen listened to the old man with a blank expression. He was just too numb after everything that happened to be surprised at him hacking into his personal records.
The weird old man looked up from the tablet and right at him. “Hmm? Oh, didn’t see you there. Hey, do you know where I can find the person who completed this learning module? You see, this learning module is one that I personally designed so I want to know who finished it in such a short time.”
Chu Shen looked at him for a couple of seconds before slowly raising his hand. The old man rolled his eyes. “What? Why are you doing that, you’re not in school boy. Just tell me where the person that completed the module is.”
He shook his head and pointed at himself. The old man looked at Chu Shen incredulously. “You, you’re the one that completed the module?” Chu Shen nodded. The old man looked at him for a second before suddenly darting forward. Chu Shen only saw a blur before he felt a prick on his arm.
There was another blur and suddenly the old man was holding a small cylindrical tube. Looking at his arm there was a small spot of blood where the old man had taken his blood.
He looked up at the man who had put the needle in his arm, for that was indeed what the tube was. “What the heck was that!?” He yelled at the old man. Who knew what he had put in him. Plus, how did that needle even go into his skin?!
The old man had switched the cable from the black box to the tube. He waved dismissively at Chu Shen as he studied the tablet’s display. “Oh, quit whining, it wasn’t that bad. I only took a couple drops of blood, nothing to get worked up about. Plus, you bent my needle a bit. I had to use the diamond tip just to get a small sample. Hmm. Seems you really are young.”
“Nothing to get worked up about? You come into my home, you hack into my personal datafiles, and then you take a blood sample. What do you think this is!” Chu Shen knew this person was dangerous but he couldn’t stand his presumptuous attitude.
“It’s not like I did anything illegal. I mean you did sign the terms and conditions, didn’t you? All I’m doing is checking the learning module and the effect it has on your health, all of which was stipulated in the document.” The old man generously explained as he looked at Chu Shen.
“Anyways kid. You have enormous talent so how about my offer? I want to give you a once in a lifetime opportunity. What do you say?”
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 59 - Xentus Viri</h1>
 
Chu Shen’s mouth dropped to the ground in shock. Really!? Just who did this man think he was? “What? Why would I do that?”
“Simple really. I can give you a lab stocked with anything you want along with a blank check to buy anything else.” The old man replied without losing momentum.
“Really, and how are you going to do that huh?” Chu Shen said sarcastically.
“Well, if I couldn’t then no one could. Trust me kid, I can offer you better facilities than anything anyone else could. I’m not the chief engineer of Sparta for nothing.”
“What?” Chu Shen asked in astonishment.
The weird old man puffed his chest with pride, making the stains on his clothes stick out. “Yes, I am the chief engineer of Sparta, Xentus Viri!”
Chu Shen facepalmed. Of course, he wasn’t the chief engineer of Sparta. He was just a whack job with some of the best enhancements he had heard of. Ushering up his courage he started towards Xentus.
It was sad really when a twelve-year-old kid had to act more mature than a normal adult. “Alright, thank you for your time Mr. Viri but I think it’s time for you to leave. Can you go now? Come on, out you go. Here take this with you.”
Chu Shen started to gently usher him out while picking up his cable and pushing it into his hands. “Wait, you’ll regret this I swear! Just hear me out, come onnnnnnne.” Xentus whined he was pushed out of the room and towards the door.
He complained the entire way telling him it was a mistake to tell him to leave until they reached the door. “Hold on! If you really want me to leave then I’ll go. Just take this okay, call me if you change your mind. My offer still stands.” He shoved a metallic silver business card into his hands. With that he walked the rest of the way out and left.
Chu Shen shut the door leaned on it as he slowly slid to the wall. He wiped off the sweat from his forehead. The entire time he was scared that the whack job would attack him. Luckily, he wasn’t that crazy.
After a couple of seconds, he recovered. Glancing over at his pizza he shook his head. After that experience, he was definitely not hungry.
…………………………………..
Since he was done learning, he had to decide what to do with his time.
With his newfound freedom, he immediately decided to explore a couple of things like music and food. Chu Shen loved the candy the most. He spent a week exploring the city and everything it had to offer. He even spent some time diving in the ocean.
Eventually though he received a call from Leonard.
Ring Ring
Chu Shen who was eating some sherbet at an ice cream parlor tapped the small communicator clipped onto his ear. “Hey Shen, it’s Leonard. Mind if I swing by to check up on you?”
He put down his spoonful of sherbet as he replied. “Yeah. I’m having some sherbet right now though. Have you ever had any? It’s delicious.”
“Hehe. At least you’re finally getting out of your house. I thought you’d be cooped up in there for the rest of your life.”
“Nope. Just taking a little vacation.”
“Anyways I’ll be there in about an hour.”
“Great, I’ll be at home waiting.”
“Bye.”
“See ya.” Chu Shen immediately dug back into his sherbet. There was still an hour left, plenty of time left for another bowl of ice cream or two.
…………………………
A while later, and a small brain freeze, Chu Shen went back to his apartment and waited until Leonard arrived.
“Hey Shen, how’s the studies going?”
“Good, just finished the trigonometry module.” A small lie but one necessary to not stand out.
“Man, you are one smart cookie. Bet your parents spent a fortune on genetic mods.” After he mentioned that Leonard immediately looked apologetically at Chu Shen. “Oh…. Sorry that’s insensitive of me. Anyways they haven’t found your parents yet but we’re still looking.”
“Don’t worry. I am confident they are all right. Just keep trying for me all right?” Another small lie but that was the price to live here.
“We sure will.”
After that they continued talking, just small chit chat about how they had been since the last time he had visited a month ago. Soon they started up a game of Galactic Conflict, a first-person shooter with holographic displays. Truly an epic game outside of Virtual Reality.
They played for five hours after which they both decided to go to bed. It was about 10 O’clock after all. Chu Shen set-up the couch which was a pullout bed. Then they crashed.
“Hey Shen, what did you do to the AI?” Chu Shen, who was in the middle of breakfast shrugged.
“What do you mean, I didn’t do anything.” Leonard shook his head.
“You must have, otherwise the panel to access its braincase wouldn’t be off.” Chu Shen’s had an ‘aha!’ moment. He had never figured out how to put the panel back on, so it just stayed off.
“Oh yes, that. Interesting story, you see there was this weird old guy…” He quickly told his tale of how Xentus Viri had come in and messed with the case and shoved him around.
After he finished he expected Leonard to scold him or laugh it off but Leonard said nothing. Instead he showed a weird expression. “He said he was Xentus Viri?”
Chu Shen nodded. “You saw him hack the AI using his hands? And all the information was correct?”
He nodded again. “Yeah, his hands were going so fast they were a blur.” Leonard blew out a breath and leaned back in his chair.
After a couple of seconds, he looked at Chu Shen. “Well, that was the real deal. That ‘weird old man’ is Xentus Viri, the eccentric Chief Engineer of Sparta.”
What???!!!!
Chu Shen was blown away by that simple statement.
Chief Engineer of the nation that was leading in technological advances? How outrageous was that!
Leonard didn’t stop there though. “Xentus Viri is a little weird as you saw. He is very eccentric and more than a little boastful. Just the fact that he is interested in you, when you just finished the trigonometry module, shows how eccentric he can be, however, he is a brilliant scientist. If he offered you a lab with unlimited resources he can undoubtedly back it up.
If you’re interested in that kind of thing you’d best call him back. He’s offering you a really good offer since the learning module was a 1000 credit anyway.” Indeed, the learning module was expensive but it also included all the books he needed for his education in an eBook format.
Leonard studied Chu Shen’s shocked face. “So, are you going to take his offer?”
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 60 - Competition</h1>
 
"So, you decided to call back huh?” Xentus Viri's pompous voice could be heard from the other end.
“Yes Mr. Viri, I have.” Chu Shen was a lot more polite this time.
“Humph. Learned some respect did ya? Well too bad! I found myself another mechanical protegee and he’s going to get my offer instead! At least he’s more respectful than certain ungrateful brats.”
“If you didn’t want me, then why did you give me your phone number then?”
“Because I wanted to hear you as you realized you gave up on a once in a lifetime opportunity. Ha!”
Chu Shen’s face scrunched up and he looked at Leonard. They were both huddled around his desk while Xentus Viri was on the line. Leonard had volunteered to guide him in the conversation.
Leonard muted the phone from their end. “Don’t worry. He’s obviously just trying to make you nervous. Just ask him what you should do to get in. Depending on what he asks, you can decide what to do. Otherwise we just have to negotiate or give up.”
Chu Shen shook his head. “No way. Like he said this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I might be able to get a similar offer but not one as good. I have to get this.”
He un-muted the phone. “Mr. Viri. I know I was rude to begin with but how was I supposed to know who you were? I only arrived on Sparta 9 months ago and have spent all that time studying.”
“Not my fault. I told you who I was and you didn’t even check out my story. You dismissed me, so I am dismissing you. Simple, see?”
“Listen Mr. Viri. I would really like to accept your offer. If you won’t let me tell me what I need to do to get accepted.”
“….” There was a long awkward silence that followed after he asked the question. Chu Shen and Leonard exchanged helpless shrugs after the first 5 minutes. What else could they do but wait?
After almost 20 minutes there was a muffled bump. “Alright.” Xentus Viri’s voice came from the desk. “I have decided. In order to have the lab along with the unlimited budget I ask you to do two things.
I have already discovered you are exceedingly smart and have a vested interest in engineering. What you need to prove to me now is that you can indeed create something otherwise the lab would go to waste.
So, prove to me that you can create something. I will pay for you to enter into the Robo Games. It’s a simple competition where you must use a limited budget to build a combat robot which will fight the other robots. The deadline for entrance is tomorrow so be ready.
If you can get 3rd place I will give you a fully stocked lab, however you will have to pay rent. 2nd place will earn you the lab with rent at half price. 1st place will earn you a free fully stocked lab.
As for the second thing. There is another competition called Pod Racing. It’s a popular racing game based off a real classic. It’s the same thing, a limited budget to build a racing vehicle.
Once again, I will pay for your entrance fee but since this involves racing you will have to have a pilot. You can, of course, pilot it but if you want to hire a pilot you will have to pay for that yourself.
The Robo Games will last five days for construction and another two days for the competition. The Pod Racing will be three days after the end of the Robo Games.
As for the rewards…. 3rd place is a set amount of credits for materials. Could be a single credit, or it could be a thousand. It really depends upon how impressed I am with your performance. 2nd place is ten times the amount as 3rd while 1st is unlimited amount of credits.
However, everything including the lab and credits must be going towards verifiable projects and not gambling debts or making alcohol. Not that you would do something since you are so young but I still must put it out there.
So, do we have a deal?”
Chu Shen immediately replied. “Give me a minute and you will have my answer.”
“Nuh-uh. Decide now.” But as Xentus was talking he was already pressing the mute button.
He looked at Leonard. “I think you should go for it. It seems to be perfect if you manage to get to the top three in both. Just ask him what happens if you lose.” Chu Shen nodded and un-muted the call.
“What happens if I don’t place in any of them?”
“Simple. I come back in another 2 years after you instruct yourself some more before giving you the same offer. You won’t even have to pay me back. It’s no skin off my nose, it’s only eight hundred credits after all.”
“I agree then.”
“Great. Look the games up and go to the registration booths. Show them my business card I gave you, it’ll be proof that you’re the one they need. Anyways, see ya. P.S. There was no other kid. Hahahahaha”
Chu Shen shook his head. “He just has to get the last word in, doesn’t he?” He said to Leonard.
Leonard just sighed. Then he stood up. “Oh well. Anyways we still have some time. You wanna register today or tomorrow?”
Chu Shen leaned back in the chair. “Tomorrow. How about today we just relax.”
“Fine with me.” Leonard replied.
“Let’s go eat ice cream then! I’m starved!”
“………”
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 61 - Rules</h1>
 
“Alright I know everyone probably knows the rules but I have to go over them anyways.” Chu Shen had registered for the Robo Games yesterday. Today was the official start of them.
Everything had been exactly the way the crazy old man had described except for the fact that it wasn’t any old competition. It was actually a major competition for the entire planet. There was even some aliens that had come like the blue skinned Crowlezx behind him.
Only people 24 years or younger could compete or their equivalent for the species in question. Chu Shen was on the side, most everyone else was a teenager or young adult. The main judge was on stage behind a podium giving the speech he was listening to.
“To start off with. Some of you might have been misled as to the exact nature of the game. We are not building robots from scratch. Rather, you will be able to buy from us, with your money, parts pre-assembled.
For example, you can buy a Raven III chassis along with an RSI Nuclear battery. Afterwards you can modify any of the designs using our workshop. Of course, you still must pay for any materials with the budget all of you will be assigned.
As for specific rules… there’s only a couple. First off you cannot use any hacking, EMP’s, anti-matter, or any weapon that can destroy or pierce a class 5 personal shield.
If you use nanites you cannot directly use them to attack your opponent. Instead they must form a weapon or be used to repair your bots. As for controlling each robot we have banned any mind-control methods as they are deemed too dangerous for competitions.
All shields for your robot must be class 4 personal shields or below.
We will scan your robot and make a copy of it for each fight. This way each robot will be in perfect condition. So, if you have any illegal gear you will be eliminated.
Now the attendants will escort you to the design room so you can plan your robot. Don’t worry though. Each room and workshop is private and the AI’s will copy your robots. No human will be able to access your blueprints.
You will have five days to complete your robot. After that the games will begin. Ask the attendant to take you to your workshop when you are ready. If you wish to test your robot please ask the AI’s to make you a digital copy to test it inside the simulation arena. That is all.
Dismissed!” The main judge walked off the stage towards the exit. The contestants looked at each other before they immediately headed out. Overall there was about 30 people with 23 of them being human.
All of them had small pins with a number on the front of their outfits. Chu Shen’s number was 28. Following the rest of the contestants he went over to the line of attendants.
Each attendant was dressed in a black formal outfit and had a number pinned to their chest like the contestants. It was obvious what it meant. Chu Shen found the attendant with a matching 28 pin.
Walking up to them he shook hands with them. “Nice to meet you.”
The attendant shook his hand back. “It is nice to meet you as well young sir. Would you like me to show you to the design room?”
Chu Shen nodded. “Yes Please.”
“Right this way then sir.” The attendant gestured for him to follow and went down a nearby hallway. After they rode in the elevator for a bit they came out on a floor with a very short hallway. At the end was a single room.
Inside was nothing but a desk and a small computer console. The attendant pointed inside the room.
“This is the design room. You can use the computer though most prefer to use the hologram instead. Don’t worry about someone getting into the room. A.I.s monitor the rooms and the only ones authorized to go up need an implant. Even the attendants can only go to the room assigned to you.
If you need anything at all ask me. The bathroom is right there and the cabinets are stocked with food and drink.” The attendant left and sat in a chair outside the room.
Chu Shen immediately closed the door and opened the hologram. First, he started looking through the designs available. ‘Hmm. That frame looks nice…. I have no idea how to control something like that….’
After he went through the list of items available he went through the budget he had and the cost for all the designs as well. Then he compared the materials list to the design list.
Following some internal debate, he made up his mind. It had to be a humanoid robot. It was, after all, the form he was most familiar with in combat. The other peculiars he would have to decide after getting the specific robot chassis.
Chu Shen spent over 5 hours inside the design room before he finally moved on to the workshop. He ordered the materials and parts using the system inside the design room.
He ordered a glass cannon kind of robot. It had powerful hydraulics but was low on armor. Then he ordered several compact batteries, energy guns and explosives along with a variety of other things.
After he was done ordering he asked the attendant to escort him to the workshop. The attendant looked at him. “Are you sure there is nothing else? You can, of course, come back if you need to.”
“I am sure. Can you take me to the workshop?”
“Of course. This way please.” The attendant took him back to the elevator. After a second or two the elevator stopped. Exiting the elevator, it appeared in a hallway the exact same as the one they came from.
Opening the door at the end of the hallway revealed an expansive room separated into several chambers. Various tools such as plasma-torches, micro-wielders, and several types of programmable nanites were all displayed here.
As soon as Chu Shen saw these tools he immediately started getting excited. He had never truly created anything outside of simulations. His blood burned to be able to start on his true dream. Crafting.
Swinging his head around he immediately looked at the large crates in the middle of the room. He looked at the attendant. “What are those crates doing here?”
“Ah. Those are the things you ordered. Do you wish for me to stay and help you unload them or should I wait outside?”
“Wait outside please. I can help myself.”
“Very well then. Please use appropriate safety precautions when you use the tools. Good-bye.” The attendant left but stayed outside waiting. Chu Shen immediately opened them. A gleam of metal could be seen as he unpacked the materials.
Taking out the items he ordered, he set them down side by side. Looking at all of it he took in a deep breath. “Ahh. Finally. I can get to work.” Cracking his knuckles, he grabbed the chassis and dragged it over to the welder.
 
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 62 - Pre-Tournament</h1>
 
Bang
A loud sound echoed out as a 1-meter tall robot was sent flying backwards. As it hit flew out of the arena it dissolved into pixels before disappearing. A 1 and 1/2-meter-tall black robot stood in the middle of the arena. It looked exactly like a human in black armor.
Chu Shen disabled the simulation. The entire arena including the area around him dissolved like snow in sunlight before revealing a plain white surface an inch or two above his head.
He removed the metal band around his head and got out of the simulation pod. Standing in front of the pod was the same robot as the one inside of the simulation! The attendant was in a chair beside it as well.
The attendant stood up. “Alright, let’s get back to the meeting room. The meeting starts in 30 minutes. Go ahead and send Mirror of The Void back to the workshop.”
Chu Shen nodded. “I’ll do that now.” He fiddled with the small tablet in his hands. As soon as he was done, the robot immediately straightened up before marching fluidly out of the room. Looking at it march out Chu Shen had a thoughtful expression. ‘Five days sure doesn’t last.’
The attendant and Chu Shen went to the elevator and arrived at the meeting room soon. Sitting down in the chair with his number, 28, he waited for the meeting to start. He played around on his tablet while waiting.
“Alright, all of the contestants are here.” The main judge walked up on stage like last time. “Now it is time to explain some specifics of the tournament.”
There are exactly 32 people in the tournament this year. We are going to have a bracket competition with the winners advancing up the bracket while the losers battle each other for their placement in the competition.
First, we will have the 16 beginning matches chosen by the AI’s to have the closest possible match. After that we will have another 16 matches. 8 of the matches will be the winners and the other 8 will be the losers.
The next day we will have the final matches to determine the exact rankings inside each group of 4. For example, if you won the first match but lost the second then you will only be able to be placed in 5th-8th place.
After the rankings have been settled we will have placement challenges. If you wish to fight someone within the 5 rankings of you both ways you can challenge them to a fight. If you do then they must accept. If the challenger wins they take that person’s ranking. Of course, this only applies if the winner is higher ranked than the other.
You may challenge anyone however if they are more than 5 rankings apart from you, they can refuse to fight. For example. If 8th place challenged 3rd place, they would have to accept. But if 8th place challenged 1st place they could refuse.”
You may challenge as many people as you want. However, if you lose you cannot challenge another person. The challenge part of the Robo games can only last for 4 hours so be quick.
Now that you know the rules it is time to start. We will transport you and your robots to the arena right now. There we will clone your robot and start the games. Be prepared, the games start in 30 minutes.
Go with your attendants to gather your robots and head to the arena. May the best engineer win!”
““May the best engineer win!”” The contestants echoed. With that they all filed out. Chu Shen swiped at his tablet a couple of times before going over to the attendant.
“Alright. Mirror of The Void is coming down to meet us. He should be here in a minute or two.”
“Good. Such a weird name though” The attendant smiled at Chu Shen before turning around. “As soon as he comes down tell him to follow me so we can get you to the arena.”
“Great.” After a while the elevator popped open with a ding revealing Mirror of The Void. Tapping a couple of times on the tablet the robots head swiveled to lock onto the attendant. After that the robot marched behind the attendant and stayed a couple of meters behind them.
“Alright, come with me.” Following the attendant, they walked out of the building where there was a line of empty hover-trucks. They walked down the line to the hover-truck with the numbers 28 on the side. Opening the back, Mirror of The Void climbed in.
The truck sank down a couple of inches. After that Chu Shen and the attendant got into the cab and drove off. As they did Chu Shen glimpsed a huge crab-like robot coming out of a large door on the side of the building they just left. They quickly drove out of sight.
..........................................................................................................................................................................................
The arena. A large disk of flat space made of non-conductive metal. Obstacles could pop up randomly inside. Large walls, ramps, and entire buildings could form suddenly. Unfortunately, such a thing would not appear for the Robo-Games.
There was also a large crowd in the stands. The stands themselves were separated from the arena by a wall and by class 5 Vehicle Shields none of the weapons the robots here were using could penetrate it.
The attendant landed the hover-truck in front of a gray square building that was attached to the arena. “Here we are. This is the control center. Inside are various types of methods that are used to control the robots.”
“Things like simulation rooms, holo-projectors, and vid-screens are all provided so that the contestants can control their robot. Each person is filmed inside their control room and broadcasted out to the universe. Exciting, right?”
“Yeah.” Chu Shen looked decidedly nervous.
“Well, most people are here to see the robots fight up close and personal. Few people pay attention to the engineers until the end where the engineer’s and robots go up to receive their prizes.”
“Of course, you will take your robot out to meet the announcers, Charles Kenith and Drexil Gargot for the Robo Games. Remember to wave at the crowd or something when they call your name.”
“Anyway, let’s go.” Chu Shen led Mirror of The Void over to the control center. There they scanned the robots to make the copies they were talking about.
Chu Shen was led out to the stands of the arena along with Mirror of The Void. Outside there were other contestants with their robots. There was all kind of weird robots. His robot looked normal compared to most.
Soon all 32 contestants were gathered along with their robots. As soon as they were a large countdown appeared in front of them. The countdown started at 10:28. 10:27, 10:26. It was counting down the time until the Robo Games started.
When it reached 0 the entire arena shifted beneath them. The entire group of contestants was raised up by the ground beneath them, including their robots, until it was even with a large floating platform above the arena.
Inside the platform was a handsome blonde man and a gray skinned humanoid with a protruding bone crest on his forehead behind a wooden desk.
The blonde man spoke first. “Alright folks, I'm Charles Kenith and this is Drexil Gargot here with Galactic News. Today we are at the Robo Games. A contest where contestants under the age of 22 build their own robot to fight to the death in a series of duels.”
“Here are their contestants along with their robots, or robot unit names. Contestant number 1 Joseph Gonzalez from Sparta, age 21 with his robot unit The Daleks Revenge, obviously a Doctor Who Fan. Contestant number 2 Dixxilio’anios Gatoonisga from the Nugitraaiil empire, age 19 with her robot unit Frethgaalos…. Contestant number 28 Chu Shen from Sparta, age 12 with his robot Mirror of The Void…. That is all of our contestants.”
Most of the contestants waved at the crowd or bowed. A couple of the non-human contestants did other things such as flaring their neck frills or shaking their tail. Chu Shen waved like his attendant suggested.
“Alright, now that you have been introduced to all of the contestants let’s get this party started. The contestants will be sitting in the dugout over there until it’s their turn to fight. Then you will go to the control room while your robot is brought out to fight.”
The gray skinned figure, Drexil Gargot, took over for Charles Kenith and pointed to a section of the stands that was right next to the control center. In fact, there was even a hallway that connected them.
“While their being seated let’s go ahead and show some of the highlights from the last Robo Game.” As the crowd was distracted by the violent display, the contestant’s robots were taken into storage while the pilots were escorted to the dugout.
“Now that everyone’s ready, let’s announce the first contestant’s numbers. Numbers 28 and 6 please get ready to fight.”
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 63 - Xentus Viri Is Intrigued</h1>
 
Chu Shen and the contestant, a human teen named Corvius, went into the control room. There was 2 of each room the attendant had mentioned. That way in case the contestants both used the same control method they could both fight at the same time.
Chu Shen went to the simulation room while Corvius went to the vid-screen. Inside he immediately went into the simulation after inserting his data for Mirror of The Void.
Upon entering he was immediately put into a pitch-black room. A heads-up-display (HUD) appeared in front of him. Various dials, readings, and icons appeared on it. This was the reason behind his robot’s name, Mirror of The Void. The robot was literally a mirror image of himself!
A voice suddenly echoed out in the dark space. “Alright folks it’s time for the fight! As you can see on the screen Chu Shen has chosen the simulation control method for his robot. Corvius however is using the tried and true R/C method. Let’s go ahead and get it on!”
Rumbling sounds was picked up by his robot’s audio systems. The ground lifted the robot upwards towards the ceiling. The ceiling parted to reveal bright light. It was like gladiators being brought to the coliseum in the Roman days!
After a couple of seconds Mirror of The Void was standing on the arena. The enemy’s robot, called Sea God’s Wrath, stood on the opposite end of the arena. The enemy robot was silver with a wide round base for the robot’s main platform, just like a crab.
It had no pinchers but two shield generators instead. Large energy guns were on top of it, each on a swivel base. There was over a dozen legs underneath that ended in spikes. Small protrusions all over the robot.
Obviously, they were sensors. The rule was that the contestants can use the control rooms but the video and hologram feeds must come directly from the robot’s sensors. This way if there was a blind spot in its coverage the contestant couldn’t cover it with his own eyes.
A large red wall appeared between the two robots. Chu Shen reached his right hand back. With a clang, a metallic staff hit his hand. Clenching the object tightly he withdrew the object.
A metal hammer 1 meter long with the head having a blunt and spiked side. If Leonard was watching he would instantly recognize its familiarity. It was extremely similar to the hammer he used to fight with the bugs.
“Alright folks it’s a great match to start off with. We have Mirror of the Void on the left and Sea God’s Wrath on the right. When the divider disappears, the match will begin.”
“In three!” There was no reaction from the divider.
““Two!”” The announcer and crowd called out. The wall turned yellow.
““One”” The wall turned green.
““Fight!”” The wall disappeared.
……………………………………
Xentus Viri sat in his office. Cold air blew on him from the vents above. ‘Heh. Somethings just can’t be improved. We still use air conditioning a thousand years after it was invented.’
Sighing he reclined in his chair.
“How is his progress Genie.”
A female voice with a metallic tinge to it replied. “He has taken a unique approach to building his robot. I believe it may catch many by surprise.”
He sat up in his chair with an eyebrow cocked inquisitively. “Oh? Do tell what’s so interesting about it.”
“He chose an Eclan Model Humanoid Robot chassis. Then he put in it a Titan Incorporated hydraulic system.”
He rubbed his chin in thought. “I see. The Eclan focus on fast responses. They use superconductors for their robot’s circuitry. The Titan Incorporated use the most powerful hydraulic systems, they're often used on gas giants.”
He looked up at the ceiling above him. “Neat but not unique. It’s been done before.”
“There are also other abnormalities. He filled the inside of the chassis with Impact Gel IV. It’s excellent for neutralizing kinetic damage and is resistant to extreme cold and heat. Because of this it is often used in escape pods.”
He nodded. “I see. So, it’s to protect the delicate insides from anything that gets past the armor.”
“It has Dura-steel I for amour.”
“Really? That stuff is good but not great. Cheap too. I assume that’s the reason he got it. Budget must have been running low.” He was leaning forward in his chair now.
“The robot has Dura-steel V for leg armor though, starting halfway below the knee. Installed in its legs is a Phantom Energy Bomb dispenser. It can create energy bombs of various charges. The bomb chute exits at the bottom of the foot.”
“What? Now why would he do that.”
“I calculate a 32.1323% chance that it is for launching long range explosive attacks. There is a 11.1129% chance that it is to make up for lack of maneuverability. It has no air-transport method.”
He frowned. “You bloody calculator. Any other goodies?”
“Yes. There are two class 3 shields on the left arm. They seem to be at the exact frequency to interact with each other. With it, the shields can strengthen each other making them stronger by 151.1%.”
“Coincidence? No… Most likely he worked out the equation for matching frequencies to share the dispersion of energy. As the energy disperses it changes frequencies to the exact one of the other shield, causing it to lose less energy and give a boost to both shields. Clever.”
“It is confirmed that it is not a coincidence. There are three class 2 shields covering the entire robot’s body. They all interact with each other in the same way. Each are a different frequency than the ones on the arm.”
“Ah. Give me a list and location of everything else.” Xentus Viri put his hands on the desk and started drumming on it with his fingers.
“On the top of the left forearm is the shield generators. On the side of the forearm is a RSC Inc. Laser, on the other side is an RSC Inc. energy burst cannon. On the underside is a plasma welder from the lab. It has been modified with extra plasma banks and can now spray a cone of plasma.
The right forearm has the exact same set-up but without the energy cannon and shield. Instead there are power-conducts and magnetic grips in the robot’s palm.
The unique part is the weapon that was hand-made inside the lab. It is a 1-meter long hammer. It is made of Dura-Crystal V, very strong and expensive. Over 30% of his budget went towards the hammer. The head has a blunt side and spiked side.
The shaft is partly hollow and has a Sparta Plasma Charge Cannon in the handle. There is also a magnetic generator to attract it to the hand and power receivers.”
Xentus Viri seemed only slightly surprised. “Wow. A souped up medieval weapon. Unique but ultimately it can’t penetrate a shield. I assume that’s where the other weapons come in.” His fingers tapped out a steady beat.
“That assumption is wrong. The head of the hammer has a kinetic generator and a frequency oscillator. The sensor package for the robot includes X-Ray, normal visual spectrum, echo-location, and frequency scanner.”
His fingers stopped beating. “Oh. So that’s his game.” He looked at the holo-screen that was showing the current match of the Robo Games. “You are right once again you darned calculator. It’ll catch them off guard.”
Xentus Viri smirked.
“This is going to be fun.”
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 64 - Tournament 1st Day (1)</h1>
 
““Fight!””
Chu Shen immediately ran towards Sea God’s Wrath while brandishing his hammer. He ducked as a beam of red energy lanced towards where his head had been. The red beam of energy followed him downwards.
Rolling forwards he activated his robot’s shields. Transparent blue energy covered his robot’s body while a darker blue energy formed in a square on his left hand. Then he started charging his energy and plasma cannons.
Three beams of energy lanced out towards Chu Shen as he came out of the roll. Using the shield on his left arm he blocked two beams while the third hit him on the chest. Both shields flared bright blue as the beams hit them.
100%, 99%, 98%. The first layer of his arm shields power dwindled at about one percent every three seconds. Aiming with his right arm a red laser beam shot out and hit Sea God’s Wrath.
Unfortunately, the two shields the robot had were activated, covering the entire front of the robot. The shield also flared brightly as the energy hit it. Chu Shen started running sideways as the energy hit him. The crab also shuffled sideways.
Neither shook off the others weapon but it helped both parties. A laser does damage by burning through the opponent. While the shield blocks the laser, it does not dissipate all the lasers heat.
This means a laser can double its damage if it continuously hits the opponent. By running they disperse the heat that is collected from the laser. Chu Shen focused on blocking the majority of the enemy’s laser with his left arms shield.
After 4 minutes of continuous pounding, one of the enemy’s lasers went out. Most likely it was close to overheating. Luckily with Chu Shen’s use of the Impact Gel IV it absorbed the heat radiating off the laser, making it harder to overheat.
Chu Shen immediately ran forward. The robot’s started off with a distance of 200 meters. He reduced it to 185 meters with his first dash. While the third beam cooled off he reduced the distance to 20 meters within 8 seconds.
The third beam shot out once again but another one of the lasers shut off. Sea God’s Wrath scuttled backwards it wasn’t slow but Chu Shen’s robot was too fast. The distance was closing slowly at two meters per second.
After he closed in he started up the kinetic generator inside the hammer. It started vibrating at tremendous speeds.
Ding
One of the icons on his HUD lit up. Chu Shen grinned, though the robot couldn’t mimic such a motion. Rolling diagonally the beams missed his robot. As he came out of the roll he pointed his left hand and fired the energy burst cannon.
A large blue ball of crackling energy shot towards the Sea God’s Wrath. By this point they were only 20 meters from the wall around the arena. The blue ball of energy shot out so fast that the robot couldn’t dodge.
With a large BANG Sea God’s Wrath was flung backwards from the explosion. The shield blocked any real damage but the impact still knocked it backwards.
The robot hit the back of the arena. As it did Chu Shen still rushed forward. Using his eye movement one of the gauges jumped up from 20 to 50. Sliding on the ground he slipped beneath the robot’s shield. Swinging the hammer blunt end first it smashed into the limb holding the shield.
CLANG CRASH ZZZT
Sparks and bits of metal flew upon the violent collision. The metal dented inwards and almost ripped off the robot. The shield flickered before disappearing. Half of the robot was now unshielded.
Chu Shen slid completely under the robot, reaching the arena’s edge. Kicking off the wall there he flew backwards, swinging at the robot’s other arm.
Unfortunately, it moved out of the way quickly, some of the pointed legs stabbing at Chu Shen though they glanced off due to the shield.
Normally even such a strong blow would not cause the shield to fail. Cause it to weaken yes, but not fail. The reason for this was the vibrations. The hammer actually vibrated at the exact frequency that most superconductors disintegrated.
Most people used superconductors since they lost very little energy. Using the partial shields also helped conserve energy. Because the shields covered less area, it became stronger and less energy was used. This was why the shield failing caused half of the robot to become unshielded even though technically the entire robot could have been shielded with one shield generator.
Smacking the ground with his left arm, Chu Shen flew up into the air, doing a somersault in the process and landed on his feet. Checking his HUD, he still had 44% of his shield arm and 60% of his body shields left. He also had another two minutes before the energy cannon could be used.
Running forward, Chu Shen took off once again at the enemy robot. Apparently having learned its lesson, it immediately started running while keeping away from the walls.
Small hatches opened on the robot’s main body. Over 30 small missiles flew out and shot towards Chu Shen. In response Chu Shen raised up both hands and aimed towards the missile cloud.
Twin cones of star-hot plasma shot out at the missile cloud engulfing it.
BOOM.
As soon as the plasma touched the missiles there was a large explosion. Chu Shen was pushed back a couple of inches from the shockwave. Most of the shrapnel was vaporized by the plasma and the explosion.
The three beams of energy once again fired at Chu Shen. Now his shields were at 31% and 42% respectively. Running forward he caught up with the robot. Firing the lasers in both arms he aimed towards the unshielded parts of the robot.
As it twisted and turned, trying to protect those parts of it, Chu Shen leapt upwards. Landing on the robot itself he turned the dial, which he had brought back down to 20 earlier, up to 80.
Swinging the hammer spiked end first, it turned into a blur.
RIIIP SMASH CLANG ZZZZT BOOOM
Loud sounds echoed out as the hammer ripped through the top of the robot, through the gun turrets on top, and into the robot’s power cells. As the power cells were ruptured they immediately blew up.
The entire robot blew up, sending shrapnel everywhere. As the hammer made contact with the chassis of the robot, Chu Shen kicked off and flew upwards. He had been aiming for the center of the robot, the most likely place for the power source of the robot.
Firing the modified plasma welders, he created a shield of plasma below him. As he did the hammer he let go of continued its course and blew up the robot’s power cell.
With the plasma neutralizing any dangerous shrapnel, only the shockwave and fiery blast itself caused Chu Shen to take damage. He flew upwards before eventually landing on the arena floor.
Both his shields first layers were gone. The second layer of his arm shield was at 73% while his body shield was on its third layer at 99%. Activating the magnet on his arm, his hammer which was halfway across the arena flew to him.
It landed in his hand with a Clang.
“And the Sea God’s Wrath has gone up in a fiery explosion! This battle was intense!”
“I agree Drexil. This fight was over in less than 10 minutes, only 3 seconds over the fastest duel in the history of the Robo Games!”
“Wow! Using a hammer is new though.”
“Definitely. Anyways, this round is complete. Numbers 14 and 3 please get ready!” The floor came alive, sucking up all the debris and his robot. The simulation cut off as his robot copy was taken to the recycler, so they didn’t waste materials. Leaving the control center Chu Shen sat down to watch the next match
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 65 - Tournament 1st Day (2)</h1>
 
While Chu Shen sat down, 2 rows behind him a human figure looked at him. Human, except for the gray scales and cat like eyes.
“Ssso. What do you thinksss.” The gray scaled figure leaned over and whispered to the blackish-purple scaled figure next to him. A forked tongue flicked out as he talked.
“Hisss robot isss ssstrong in clossse quartersss. Defenssse isss ssstrong asss well. Hisss long range fire isss weak if not given time to charge.”
“Agreed. Ssso, keep at long range and dodge hisss burssstsss of firepower?” The gray scaled figure questioned.
“Yesss. Take to the ssskiesss, it will accomplisssh both. I sssaw no hint of flight capability but be careful.”
“For the glory of the empire!” The gray scaled figure saluted the other with one clawed hand on his left shoulder.
“For the glory of the empire!” The blackish-purple figure saluted back.
Unknown to Chu Shen, these scaled figures that were discussing strategies to beat him were the lizard folk from the Nugitraaiil empire. It was not just idle wondering. The Robo Games had released a bracket for betting and Chu Shen would be contestant number 3, the gray scaled Nugitraaiil’s, opponent if he won his next fight.
His number was called shortly after Chu Shen had sat down. The gray Nugitraaiil smiled, exposing razor sharp teeth.
Fighting was what they lived for after all.

Chu Shen sat back and observed the other 15 fights. All of them were interesting and definitely unique. 11 of the 32 contestants chose to use humanoid robots including him. Other strange robots like a drone swarm were used as well.
What he did notice was that of the 32 contestants, 27 had flight capabilities. The other fights took a little over three and a half hours. It might seem like a long time until you consider the fact that there were 15 fights and each took about 14 minutes.
Finally, it was time for the second round. They would first determine the top 8, then the top 4. After that the losing 16 contestants would also fight for the top 8, then top 4 of the losing bracket. The next day the specific ranks would be fought out between each group of four. Finally, the challenges would commence. With that, the Robo Games would end.
Chu Shen was called up. “Alright, let’s go ahead and get the next stage of the games going! In the first arena is numbers 28 and 3. In the second arena is numbers 31 and 2. Take your positions.”
Soon the robots were on the stadiums floor. This time was different though. The arena was cut in half with a solid wall cutting the arena in two. To save on time, after the original fights, there would now be two fights at the same time.
Chu Shen faced his opponent, a large rectangular robot. It had no limbs or protruding parts, it looked just like a box. He remembered it from its fight earlier. It had used nanites to form various weapons all over its chassis.
The opponent had never breached its shields, which were very strong. The robot, called Drethgaalos, was fast and could hover about five meters off the ground.
The announcers introduced the robot’s names in both arenas before they counted down with the crowd.
““Three!””
““Two!””
““One!””
““Fight!””
Chu Shen activated his shields and stayed back for a couple of seconds, to see what the Drethgaalos would do. The robot also activated it’s shields before the bottom part of it pulsed blue.
Immediately it shot upwards, far higher than it did before. Fifteen beams of red energy shot downwards as lasers grew from the side of the Drethgaalos. The energy beams though were half as big as the Sea God’s Wrath.
It hit Chu Shen but he quickly moved out of the way, avoiding a disastrous buildup of heat. Blue bursts of pure energy streaked towards him as an energy cannon popped out on the underside of the robot.
Chu Shen returned fire as he kept weaving and dodging. The both did the same. It was a basic stalemate often found in the Robo Games. Two robots firing at each other while dodging.
An icon lit up on his HUD. Pointing his left hand, he fired the energy burst cannon at the flying robot. A familiar crackling blue ball of energy shot towards the Drethgaalos.
But it didn’t hit it. The second the barrel of the energy burst cannon lit up, the Drethgaalos immediately flew towards the ground. The ball of energy barely missed the robot, but miss it did.
Chu Shen cursed at the slowness of the robot’s processor. He saw the Drethgaalos start to drop and immediately tried to correct his aim. Unfortunately, the robot was a touch too slow, causing it to miss by a hairs breadth.
The first layer of both shields was starting to fail. While the power of the enemy’s lasers was lacking, they were like piranhas. Slowly devouring his shields one bite at a time.
Sighing he decided it was time. He activated another icon on his HUD along with his hammer’s kinetic generator. Then for the first time he activated the frequency scanner and oscillator. Finally, he flicked the dial controlling the Titan Hydraulics to 100.
Running towards the flying robot he gave up on shooting at it.
…………………………………………………….
The gray Nugitraaiil smiled, exposing his pointed teeth. By now everything was going according to plan. His shields had barely dropped below 90% while the other robot had taken a lot of hits over the past ten minutes. Its shields were starting to flicker.
The empire would certainly have a lot of pride in being able to beat one of these humans in their competitions. Suddenly the robot stopped shooting and ran towards him.
Growling in excitement, the Nugitraaiil closed in for the kill. Obviously, this was a desperate last-ditch effort. As he rained death on the robot, everything suddenly went wrong.
…………………………………………………….
Chu Shen activated the explosives underneath his feet. As he did he jumped upwards. With a BANG, he shot upwards like a bullet. As he passed by the hovering machine, he flipped his robot around and used the explosives again.
Shooting downwards he swung his hammer. Instead of a burst of colors as the hammer struck the shield there was a loud CLANG BANG as the hammer struck the robot’s chassis and completely tore it in two.
As he hurtled towards the ground there was a BOOOM as the two parts promptly blew up. Flipping back around tiny explosions helped slow him down. He landed on the ground, slightly denting it as he fell to his knees from the powerful impact.
“Well… I…. I don’t know what to say. But we all know the result. Contestant number 28 has won!” The announcers were stunned. Other sounds rang out, slightly muffled, from the other arena, at odds from the quiet arena.
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 66 - Tournament 1st day (3)</h1>
 
While the crowd was stunned as to the reason the hammer could bypass the shield, the other contestants were looking decidedly worried.
‘Crap. If he can cancel out my shields, doesn’t that mean my robot is useless?’
‘This...This is terrifying. I concentrate my robot on its defense! With this, I can’t win!’
‘How does he do that? I wonder…. Could it be he found a way to disrupt the shield through magnetic pulses?’
Such were the thoughts of the other contestants. While most worried what this meant for their fighting style, a select few were curious on how he accomplished such a feat. If they could figure out how, then would they be able to come up with a counter?
Chu Shen saw their concern written on their faces as he sat down. He smirked. It was so simple yet almost no one had thought of it! The way he canceled the shield earlier was this.
His hammer vibrated at certain frequencies. By vibrating at the exact opposite frequency of the opponent's shield the two frequencies canceled each other out! When that happened, the shield and the vibrations would disappear, allowing his hammer and the robot chassis underneath to be meet!
The oscillator changed the frequency while his robot scanned the opponent’s shield frequency. This was the real reason he decided to use a hammer. To test out this idea! Of course, this idea only worked if the opponent had only one shield frequency. If they had multiple layers with one frequency than his hammer would only cancel one and no the other layers.
Even if that was said, most contestants only used one frequency for all their shields. If they accidentally chose the wrong frequencies, then the shields could interfere with each other. If that happened, it would be best that they didn't have a shield at all. As a result, most contestants stuck with one frequency to avoid interference and instead focused on building the robot and adding on weapons.
All the contestants were separated into brackets of eight. Each group had people with a similar win-lose ratio. For example. Chu Shen was in group 1 with a 2-0 count. However, number 17 was in group 4 with a 0-2 count. Group 2 had a 1-1 count and so did group 3.
However, the ones who won their first fight but lost the second would be in group 2 while those who lost their first fight but won their second would be in group 3.
Chu Shen could be considered as a very troublesome opponent. Of course, others probably had hidden cards that wouldn’t be revealed like Sea God's Wrath that unleashed that unexpected missile attack.
Chu Shen waited for another two hours. Finally, it was time for the third and final round. With this there would be 8 groups made of 4 contestants. The next day they would be fighting to see what their specific rankings would be. Then they would do the challenges.
This time Chu Shen wasn’t called first. Instead he had to wait until the sixth fight was done. “Alright contestant numbers 28 and 1, please take your positions.”
Chu Shen faced the robot swarm. Yes, a swarm of robots. There were twenty robots in total. They were small cylindrical robots about half a meter tall. Two lasers were jutting outwards from the front. The body was gold and had golden half spheres studded on the outside. It looked just like the Dalek from Doctor Who.
As expected from someone who named their robot swarm, The Dalek's Revenge.
““Fight!””
Chu Shen activated the shields and then immediately dodged. The daleks had immediately taken off, firing lasers at him. They swarmed upwards, flying in a complicated swarm.
Chu Shen had no idea how his opponent could control that many but they were very troublesome. As he started firing into the swarm, his blasts would hit a dalek. However, as he started to wear down the shield of one dalek, another dalek would fly in front of the beam, letting the previous dalek recover its shield.
He was barely managing to dent the enemy. Using the explosives, he shot upwards. When he became level with the daleks he started shooting towards them in a zigzag pattern. Right foot boom. Flies left. Left foot boom. Flies right.
He quickly closed in on them. Suddenly the daleks stopped their complicated maneuvers and made a wall. All of them fired the lasers at him! It was a wall of forty lasers from the two lasers on the front and the one on the dome that looked like the head.
Shielding himself he blocked the lasers he couldn’t dodge and closed in the gap. Aiming with his left hand he shot the energy burst cannon. As the ball of crackling energy flashed into the swarm of robots, it obliterated one of the robots!
Bang Zzzzt
The energy ball smashed through two of the daleks, the third dalek’s shield flashed but managed to block it. Chu Shen fell to the ground as the explosives in his feet needed to cool down.
Unfortunately, he couldn’t use his hammers shield nullifying property properly in a fight like this. For one, each dalek had a different shield frequency. For another, locking on to one in such a formation was impossible.
Chu Shen sighed. Another one of his trump cards was needed here as well. Grabbing the head of his hammer, the outer edge of nanites molded to his arm. Activating yet another icon, he pointed it at the swarm of daleks.
The seemingly solid shaft split apart, forming a showerhead like bottom.
PSEEEEEW
Streams of bright blue superheated plasma flew into the air. The showerhead like opening might seem funny, but it wasn’t a laughing matter. The superheated plasma flew upwards in a stream that seemed to go everywhere.
The daleks couldn’t dodge it, every single one had some plasma strike it. The plasma sizzled on the shields as it burned through it. The shields quickly disappeared but the plasma fell to the ground without burning the robot themselves.
Chu Shen grinned. His plasma cannon could fire in different modes, giving rise to different effects. This one he called [Scatter Rain Mode] and shot out dozens of medium power shots.
Taking aim once again he fired. However, the daleks quickly shot everywhere, dodging some of the shots. Another six were destroyed, taking the total daleks down to 11. He unhooked the hammer from his arm when his plasma cannon ran out of ammo.
Chu Shen went to fire again with his laser when five of the daleks charged towards him while firing. Dodging their fire his eyes widened as a dalek appeared in front of him.
“Exterminate! Exterminate!” A metallic voice called out which Chu Shen picked up with the audio receptors in his robot. Sensing danger he used the exploding boots to shoot backwards. Not a moment too soon either.
BOOOOM
The dalek promptly exploded. As it went off his shield immediately went down from 44% to 12% on the first layer. The other four daleks quickly shot towards Chu Shen, continuing their pursuit.
“Tch. So annoying.” Chu Shen frowned as he once again shot up into the air, making sharp turns as explosions went off with every move. He couldn’t fire the plasma cannon again, it took a while to charge up.
He laid down a swathe of plasma using the plasma welders on both arms. The remaining 6 robots that weren’t suicidal weren’t slacking either. Instead they were firing lasers at Chu Shen while he flew, constantly needling his shield.
The 4 daleks chasing him ran into the quickly dissipating plasma. When it did, the daleks started melting from the star-hot plasma.
Fzzzzt
Two of them sparked as their electronics were damaged. The other 2 had their appearance warped but they still chased Chu Shen. Unfortunately, his boots were quickly overheating from the explosions. If he continued to use them, then the metal might become warped, causing a jam.
Changing some of the icons and dials on his HUD he pointed his foot towards the six daleks clumped together. The operator, apparently assuming that he was trying to change direction again, didn’t do anything.
They were wrong.
A setting on his HUD changed as Chu Shen activated the bomb dispenser. An energy bomb flew out of the tube on the bottom of the Duralloy plated foot. It struck the group of daleks, promptly exploding.
BOOOOM
How could the Phantom Energy Bomb dispenser be used as a just a transportation mode? Previously Chu Shen had turned the bombs down to only 5% of their normal strength. This bomb that hit the daleks was at 50%, the highest it could go without depleting its power cell seriously.
The four daleks closest to the explosion were ripped to shreds. The other two flickered with energy before being thrown through the air from the shockwave. The daleks had barely managed to regenerate their shields which saved their lives but now their shields were gone once again.
One of the remaining daleks spiraled out of control, sparks flying as the shockwave apparently knocked something loose. It fell to the floor, smoke rising from its body.
Zzzzt Sssssss
A crackling blue ball of energy once again shot out and smashed into the other functioning dalek.
BANG
It was ripped to shreds. Chu Shen turned around to deal with the other daleks but while he was distracted taking out the 6 daleks, these last two had gotten closer.
BOOOOM
One blew up while the other hung back. Chu Shen flew backwards from the explosion. The fact that he was still in midair didn’t help him at all. As he fell though he fired both lasers at the one remaining dalek, causing two holes to burn through it.
Boooom
It blew up as something critical was hit. Apparently, the plasma from earlier melted it’s shield projectors so it was completely unprotected. Unfortunately, because of shooting down the other dalek, he didn’t have enough time to slow down his descent. Also, his shields were severely weakened from the explosion earlier, causing them to fail.
Because of the explosion hurling him downwards he hit the ground very hard. For the first time his robot was injured, a dent appearing in his left shoulder. Thick green goo oozed from it for a second before stopping.
“Contestant 28 has won once again! Give Chu Shen a round of applause folks, apparently, he is the favorite for bringing home the trophy. It’s time for some other matches folks. Contestant numbers…."
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 67 - Tournament 2nd day (1)</h1>
 
Chu Shen was now in the top four. With his 3rd win he was finished for the day. Going home he celebrated his victory with Leonard. By now it was 10 o’clock and Chu Shen had only had a hotdog from one of the stands for lunch.
The next morning, he ate breakfast before heading to the arena at ten. It was time for the finals. First group 8 would have a total of 4 fights.
They would have 2 fights, each between two random members of group 8. Then the losers and winners of the two fights would fight each other, giving them their final ranking.
This would be repeated for all the groups until the final rankings, 1st-32nd, were decided. Then there would be an hour to have duels to advance before the rankings became permanent.
Chu Shen arrived and it wasn’t long before the tournament started.
“Alright folks, I am sure we are all eager to get started. Just like last year, the finals are going to be special! The arena will no longer be a flat surface, but instead it will shift and create landscapes!”
“As for all those worrying about missing the action because of a tree being in the way, don’t worry! Our nano-drones will be capturing the action to be displayed on your seats. Just switch between the angles for maximum pleasure.”
“Now for the fight, group 8 contestant numbers……” Chu Shen watched for a while before getting bored. Various familiar faces such as Sea Gods Wrath and Daleks Revenge popped up every now and then. It took a long time before it was finally his turn.
“Contestant 28 and contestant 13 take your positions.”
It was time for Chu Shen’s next match.
………………………………………………......................
Xentus Viri peered at his display. Beside him was a young boy with red hair.
The young boy pointed at the display. “Who is that Mr. Viri? Why did you ask me to watch him? You know I’m busy experimenting with the nanites building program.”
Xentus shook his head. “Lucas. You’re too impatient. I still remember when you asked me to find you some friends. Well, this person just might meet my requirements. He’s smart, friendly, and doesn’t judge people. He even made friends with a clone in a heartbeat.”
Lucas looked at the screen. “He doesn’t seem that impressive.”
“Look at this then.” He brought up the specs for the robot Chu Shen built. “Keep in mind. He started learning on a 6th grade level not even a year ago. He barely knew what square roots were.”
Lucas glanced over them a couple of times. “Interesting but I think I could improve it a little. Still. To come so far in a year, I think I just might like him.”
“He lost his parents too. He was found alone on a planet the bugs had attacked. His parents had gone on a camping trip leaving him alone and while they were gone the bugs invaded. His parents weren’t found among the survivors or the refugees.”
Lucas kept silent. After a couple of minutes, he got up and left. A small tear dropped on the floor as he walked out the door.
…………………………………………………....................................
Bang
The enemy robot flew backwards as the hammer struck him. A dent appeared on the shield projector from the blow, causing the shield to flicker before fading out of existence. The opponent was Sir William, a robot designed to look like a knight and was a very sturdy robot.
However, it was very unfortunate that it had met Chu Shen. It had a lot of armor plating and shields. But it was like Chu Shen was made to counter this kind of robot. He could bypass it's shield and destroy the robot itself or he could wreck it's shields before destroying it with heavy fire.
His hammer nullified the five overlapped shields because they were the same frequency. Most of the time using shields of different frequencies interfered with each other and caused them to use up power faster.
As for memorizing the shield frequencies that interacted beforehand…. That was impossible.
They were a closely guarded secret on Sparta and as such, it wasn’t available to the public. The only way to use them was if you figured out the equation like Chu Shen had.
Chu Shen dashed forward, targeting the shield projectors. He had already destroyed the two lasers and plasma gun that had tried to shoot him. He also had his first close look at a rail gun.
It shot a projectile at him so fast it broke Mach 7. He couldn’t see it, even with his enhanced body. It smashed into his robot and sent it flying backwards. It even took down his shields by 20%.
However, Chu Shen quickly dismantled the deadly weapon. As a result, all this valiant knight was, is a walking trashcan. It still swung the sword attached to its right hand in noble defiance.
He quickly dismantled the shield generators, leaving it vulnerable to his truly destructive powers. While his hammer was great against opponents with shields, it didn't do as much heavy damage to armored opponents like this one. What really did the most damage was the vibrations that disintegrated the enemy from the inside out.
Because he had to break through the shield he couldn't use vibrations to properly disintegrate the enemy’s robot. Instead he could bypass the shields and target its vulnerable spots like he just done. Out of respect of the noble warrior, Chu Shen shifted his hammer into its plasma cannon form, [Lancing Rain Mode]. [Lancing Rain Mode] was a very powerful attack meant for a single target.
This time instead of a shower curtain it turned into a funnel shape with the large end pointing towards Sir William. A blue glow appeared on the end. Suddenly a bright beam of energy shot out.
PSEEEEEEW PSSSSSSSHHHHHH
The beam was over a meter in diameter, obliterating the entire top half of the noble knight. Chu Shen bowed towards the smoldering remains of the robot before deactivating the simulation.
With that, he advanced on to the final round.
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 68 - Tournament 2nd Day (2)</h1>
 
Chu Shen didn’t sit down, but remained in the simulator room. Shortly after there was another announcement.
“The battle has ended between contestants 2 and 8 with contestant 2 being the winner! It has all come down to this… Who will win, Dixxilio’anios Gatoonisga from the Nugitraaiil empire, or Chu Shen from Sparta? Find out after the break.”
In two minutes, the fight would start. As Chu Shen started prepping for the fight, the was a knock on the door. Opening it there was a black-purple scaled figure.
The Nugitraaiil bowed to Chu Shen. “I am Dixxilio’anios Gatoonisga from the Nugitraaiil empire. I request that you let my brother be freed of his bonds.”
Chu Shen just stared at her for a second.
“.......What?”
“I asked if you could free my brother.”
Chu Shen shook his head. “I heard, I just don’t understand. I don’t have your brother as a captive, so how could I free him?”
The Nugitraaiil hissed in their own form of amusement. “I see. You weren’t even aware of what you did. The Nugitraaiil are a warrior race. If you beat them, then they will obey you until they can beat you. I would like for you to free my brother from such an obligation.”
Chu Shen nodded. “I can do that. I also free you from your obligation as well.”
Now it was the Nugitraaiils turn to look confused. “What do you mean, I have no obligation to serve you.”
He laughed. “Well in about ten minutes you will so I wanted to clear things up beforehand.”
The Nugitraaiil blinked in astonishment before showing her teeth in amusement. “Hissss. You are an arrogant one. I will face you in battle, but I will not lose. It is unfortunate that you took my brother off-guard otherwise you might not be here.”
“Alright it’s time for the final match. Contestants, take your positions please.” The Nugitraaiil left quickly while Chu Shen climbed back into the simulation pod.
Soon he was back in the match. Just like her brothers Drethgaalos, her Frethgaalos was shaped like a box and used nanites to form its weapons all over its body.
As the crowd counted down Chu Shen prepared to end this quickly. 
““Three!””
““Two!””
““One!””
““Fight!””
The Frethgaalos immediately shot upwards, but this time over twenty meters in the air. Chu Shen switched his hammer into its plasma gun mode. Heating up the plasma cannon took time but it was better to have it deployed then miss an opportunity.
Using his HUD, he switched all the dials to 100 for the first time. Suddenly his robot blurred, leaving an afterimage. It immediately appeared in the middle of the arena.
Raising both arms, lasers fired towards the bottom of the Frethgaalos. The Frethgaalos dodged left as the lasers lanced past. Bolts of energy shot downwards from the guns of the Frethgaalos as they grew out from underneath it.
Chu Shen left after-images as he moved so fast the people watching couldn’t process his speed. The energy bolts impacted beside him. At the same time, the Frethgaalos dodged his lasers.
Both sides blasted at each other with only the occasional blow landing. As glowing beams of energy was exchanged, the shields on both sides quickly depleted. Suddenly a crackling ball of energy emerged from the raised left hand of Chu Shen.
A beam of purple energy shot out as a particle cannon opened fire from the back of the Frethgaalos. Both sides dodged but Chu Shen was clipped with the beam on his side.
BANG BANG
Chu Shen was sent flying backwards, leaving a crater in the ground. Suddenly several pieces of his hammer detached before flying upwards. They flew towards the Frethgaalos.
Activating his hammers [Plasma Slug Mode], a blue ball of plasma fired out towards the Frethgaalos. As the dangerous projectile grew closer, the Frethgaalos quickly moved sideways.
However, how could Chu Shen not have known this? The hammer parts in midair suddenly projected a magnetic field, redirecting the plasma ball towards their target.
The ball changed direction in midair, homing in on the fleeing Frethgaalos. Before it could do anything else, the plasma ball smashed into the robot, sending sparks into the air as its shields were massively depleted. The hammer parts quickly came back down to him.
Chu Shen once again fired lasers at the robot. Activating the explosives in his boots he quickly closed the distance between him and the other robot.
Knowing how disadvantageous it was to get close to him, the robot quickly sped away. Spinning around, he fired explosives from his feet at the fleeing robot and several laser beams for good measure. The explosives exploded barely a meter above the robot.
BOOM
The explosives shockwave forced the robot toward the ground. Also landing on the ground, Chu Shen closed the distance but right as he was about to reach the Frethgaalos, it shot upwards once again.
That purple light lanced out and hit him smack dab in the middle. The superheated particles blasted a hole in his chest but this time his shield did not stop the beam. As a result, he kept charging forward, not being blasted backwards.
The impact gel absorbed the blast and stopped the particle beam from going completely through him. Activating the explosives at 20% of their power, he shot upwards far faster than before.
Boom Boom creak
His leg armor cracked slightly from the blow. Flying upwards at a speed the Frethgaalos could not dodge he oriented himself to fire everything he had. He fired the plasma cannon still in its previous mode, the phantom bomb at 90% power, and the energy cannon at point blank range.
BOOOOOOOMMMMMMM
The resulting explosion launched him backwards and obliterated the Frethgaalos completely. He fell downwards, his shield had been destroyed by the particle cannon and the blast ripped apart most of his front.
He fell downwards, hitting the ground hard. Green goo spread on the floor surrounding him in a puddle, eerily similar to a human bleeding out. Sparks flew from his body. Struggling he stood up, compensating for the power bleed outs.
Metal plates were stripped, still dripping with impact gel, revealing the hydraulic system underneath. Bits of metal dangled from his mangled left arm.
“Chu Shen has placed first! A twelve-year old has come in first place! Well folks, he still has to defend his title so get ready!”
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 69 - Tournament End</h1>
 
After Chu Shen won the tournament it was time to start the challenge part of the Robo Games. It would only last for an hour but the arena was still divided in two.
Chu Shen, surprisingly enough, only received one challenge.
It wasn’t because the others were scared but rather, within the 5-rank limit there was none that could match his robot. He perfectly countered the exact type they had made.
Besides the two Nugitraaiil the two other contestants were heavy units that used mainly shields or large amounts of weapons. Neither had armor that could protect it from Chu Shen’s hammer.
Of course, there will always be a lone person standing out. And this person was naturally the Nugitraaiil that Chu Shen had beat. With his pride, how could the gray Nugitraaiil believe that he couldn’t beat Chu Shen if he wasn’t caught off-guard by his weird abilities.
The gray Nugitraaiil with his Drethgaalos tried once more to defeat Chu Shen and since he was ranked fifth he had to fight. Unfortunately, Chu Shen once again beat him.
Afterwards the gray Nugitraaiil went up to Chu Shen and said he would follow him until he could beat him, according to his races traditions. Chu Shen waved him off saying that he only needed to build a robot with his in mind to beat him.
The gray Nugitraaiil thought about that and nodded. If he had known about the capabilities of Chu Shen’s robot before building his own, then he would have gone a completely different direction.
With that in mind he could put his pride at rest, accepting that Chu Shen was not better than him, just less traditional. Saying farewell, he didn’t bother Chu Shen with trying to follow him. The purplish-black Nugitraaiil nodded at him in acknowledgment before ignoring him.
After everyone realized that Chu Shen’s robot was meant for a different fighting style than the one they were using they also realized this fact. Until the next Robo Game, there was no way to beat him.
With that realization, everyone’s eyes turned from his position, to second, causing a fierce competition to break out.
Eventually it ended. Within that hour there were over 13 fights. Finally, Chu Shen was called up to the arena to receive a medal from the founder of the Robo Games, Steven Bawkins.
“It is with my greatest pleasure that I give Chu Shen the {Best Engineer Youth Award}. I hope that he continues in his quest for knowledge.” With that, the gray haired elderly man placed the medal on his neck.
Bowing, Chu Shen shook hands with him before leaving shortly after.
……………………………….................................................
“Huh?” Chu Shen looked puzzledly at the view screen.
“That’s right. You passed. Free materials and workspace for ya, now I just have to get you to come on up to Athena. Ugh. All that paperwork…. What a pain.”
Chu Shen shook his head. “I know I won first place in the Robo Games but I haven’t done the Pod Racing yet.”
Xentus Viri looked up from his grumbling. “Hmm? Oh that. Yeah, yeah, I changed my mind. Can’t an old fellow like me do that? Anyway, I expect you to be here in a week. I’ll send some transport to fetch you at two OK? Good, see ya.”
“Wait, I didn't agree to…. And he’s gone.”
Chu Shen had no idea what just happened but apparently Xentus Viri wanted him to get to work sooner than later. He shrugged. He still had a week left and Leonard was still here. Time to have some fun.
………………………………………….......................................................
Xentus Viri rubbed his forehead. “Ughhhh. That crazy kid. Lucas, if I knew how much you’d like him I would have never shown him to you until I finished testing him.”
Chu Shen wasn’t being passed because Xentus Viri was impressed with his work, though he did think it was pretty good, but because he couldn’t stand up to Lucas. He was practically a son to him after he raised Lucas for the past five years.
Whenever he asked for anything, he got it. The only thing he ever had difficulty with was bonding with fellow kids. Lucas was just too smart and loved science.
Because of that the only thing he ever really talked about was nanites, FTL equations, the probabilities of the big rip or the big crunch being true. Normal teenagers didn’t really think about that.
So, to solve his social awkwardness, Xentus Viri came up with a solution. Bring in some genius kids from across Sparta, give them a lab, and then put Lucas in as well.
With that some bonding would happen. Unfortunately… none of the other kids around Lucas’ age was smart enough. Only Chu Shen, who was three years younger than Lucas, fit the criteria.
So, when he showed off Chu Shen, the only candidate to be his friend after five years, well…….
Endless questions, constant nagging, begging, pleading. All the tricks found in any teenager’s bag including some that weren’t, like hacking Genie and making his AI pester him for Lucas, were employed on the helpless Xentus.
It had gone on for only the past day but it was still enough to drive him crazy. Finally, he gave in, resulting in Chu Shen skipping the last test for him and being sent here straight away.
He sighed and shook his head. “Well Lucas. Let’s see how you do with friends.
 
 
 
<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 70 - Cyborg BFF</h1>
 
“Hey Chu Shen! I have an interesting project over here. I wanna see if we can modify the nanites programming to combine into androids.” Lucas Webil called out.
Chu Shen stuck his head out into the hallway. Black oil covered his face. “Sure. If it works, maybe I can use it for my robot project.”
“Let’s go then!” Lucas dashed down the hallway while Chu Shen quickly followed him. It had been another month since he had won the Robo Games, making it a little over 10 months since he came to this realm.
Nowadays it was like a dream. Unlimited budgets, the capability to test whatever came to mind. It was heaven. Of course, Chu Shen hadn’t forgotten exactly why he had come here.
He could modify a couple of things so that it emitted radiation/Qi in his room so he could cultivate. He even broke through to be a level 4 Martial Student. Master Ti Wu woke up and was livid at the fact that he wasted so much time learning ‘useless’ things.
That was until Chu Shen showed him one of the robots he was building. Even Master Ti Wu admitted this path had potential. One of his robots was as powerful as a Martial Practitioner. And according to Xentus, this was child’s play compared to Sparta’s real weapons.
Right now, they were encouraged to build whatever came to mind. After he deemed they were ready, they would have access to all the projects Xentus had worked on or was working on. Of course, if they ever gave away any blueprints to Sparta’s enemies, they would be killed on the spot.
The only people here on Athena, besides Xentus, was Lucas and Chu Shen. Lucas was a fifteen-year-old cyborg with a pretty tragic past.
“The accident happened five years ago. It was take your kid to work day. My parents were a part of Xentus Viri’s research team. They were working on the project while I watched behind a forcefield when something went wrong.
Mr. Viri said it was a quantum fluctuation that caused the experimental FTL drive to explode. It killed my parents and almost killed me.
The only thing that wasn’t destroyed was my brain. Mr. Viri heard about what happened and felt responsible. It was the project he was working on with my parents that went wrong. Because of that he personally helped me.
He found out because of quantum interference that any attempt at regrowing the body would cause it to become twisted and deformed. So instead he transferred my brain, which was starting to become cancerous from the energy, into a digital format. It had some side-effects though.
For one I don’t forget things plus I had a massive rise in IQ. Before I was already a genius at 171 but it went to 290 when I changed. After he gave me a new brain he gave me a physical body though I have modified it a little bit.
After discovering my intelligence plus the fact that he still felt responsible for the accident he took me in. He made me who I am today.”
This was what Lucas had told him. Feeling sorry for Lucas he shared the made-up story of his parents being lost to the bug invasion. Of course, he still felt the pain since he truly didn’t know if his parents were okay.
Feeling that special companionship that comes from mutual loss, both grew closer. Within a single month they became the best of friends.
Right now, they were on one of Sparta’s moons, Athena, inside a special complex that Xentus Viri had created. As a result of being in the same building they shared a lot of the same things, helping them to bond faster.
Xentus himself urged these feelings on. He said it quite clearly. “One of you is like a son to me. The other like a ruffian picked up from the road. I expect you both to become brothers, at least, as long as I’m alive hehe.”
After Chu Shen helped him with his project, Lucas stared at him. He looked back. “What?” He asked, feeling a little weirded out.
“Don’t you know what today is?” Lucas asked with a look of disbelief.
“December 25th, why?” Chu Shen looked puzzled, still not getting the point.
Lucas rolled his eyes. “Christmas, you dummy. You know, that holiday where everyone exchanges gifts?”
Chu Shen shook his head. “Nope, never celebrated it.”
Lucas shook his head sadly. “Well, either way I got you something.” He pulled a small red present out from one of the cabinets. Handing it to Chu Shen he waited anxiously. “Go on, open it!”
Obeying Chu Shen opened the small red box to reveal a small necklace. “I got Mr. Viri to help with it. It’s a class 2 vehicle shield calibrated to cover your body. I figured it could help protect you in case of an explosion so that happened to my……. parents. Doesn’t happen to you.” Lucas wiped away a small tear while smiling at him.
Chu Shen’s heart ached with pain. He hugged Lucas. “Don’t worry. It’s not that easy for me to die.” On an impulse, he withdrew the only thing he had that he could give away. One of the bracelets from the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.
“Here., I have one just like it. Hold on to it until I can find a different gift okay?”
They talked for a little bit before heading back to their own projects. As Chu Shen worked with the plasma welder on the fabricator in front of him, he tried to think of what to get Lucas.
‘Hmm. Something unique. It must be meaningful so what could it be? Maybe a mech using that liquid metal.’
“Ah. Finally finished. With this modified fabber, I can use even junk metal. Heh. Maybe I can use this as a gift for Lucas.” He smiled at that thought.
Then it happened.
A translucent barrier appeared around him. Chu Shen gaped at it for a second in shock before he reacted. Using his spatial ring he quickly stored the fabber inside it before he disappeared.
……………………………………………........................................
Xentus Viri was in the middle of extrapolating data from the miniature black hole in his lab.
Beep
He lifted his head from the raw data being displayed. “What is it Genie. I’m in the middle of a breakthrough here.”
“Sir, I have detected an anomaly.”
“What exactly?”
“The two children, Lucas Webil and Chu Shen have disappeared. I detected some form of energy around them before they vanished from my sensors. The energy is like what is detected from wormholes.”
“WHAT!?” Xentus yelled. “GET ME A READOUT OF THAT ENERGY QUICKLY! I NEED TO FIND THEM NOW!" He immediately made the connection between his work on the blackhole and the energy of a wormhole appearing inside the facility. 'Oh god. Please don't let this be my fault.'

Glossary – Chu Shen’s Notes
 
Chu Shen has luckily written down all of the notes from his class along with any interesting facts he has picked up. As he discovers more he will write down more notes.
Cultivation Stages Chu Shen knows are separated into 4 realms. The Mortal Realm, Martial Realm, Natural Realm, and Universe Realm.
Note
Inside the realms there are different stages, each stage also has 10 levels. There are 8 Major Meridians and inside the meridians is a total of 10 blockages resulting in 10 levels. When the 10th has been cleared the meridian or stage has been mastered. This ranking system was adopted to the other stages as well.
Note
Included are the different signs of being in that stage. Emperor stage is unique in that an additional meridian is needed to break through from level 5 to level 6. Almost any meridian can be cleared in any order. However, the first meridian is always the outer meridians. The outer meridians are unlike the other Major Meridians. It is a series of small meridians that must be unblocked. These small meridians also have 10 blockages.
(Mortal Realm: Body Strengthening and traces of Qi)
Man: Characterized by Qi being present in body
Tiger: Characterized by amount of Qi being present in body and dantian
Dragon: Characterized by amount of Qi being present in body and dantian

Ratings for Pills and Weapons Chu Shen knows
Note
Pills and weapons are separated into Tiers and inside those Tiers are grades. Grades are 1-10 just like cultivators. Included is cultivation stages that these would be suitable for.
(Mortal Tier: Weapons with 0-1 Star inscriptions, Pills with appropriate energy)
Low-Tier any grade: Man Stage
Middle Tier any grade: Tiger Stage
High-Tier any grade: Dragon Stage
 
(All Further Tiers are unknown at this time)
 
Soul
The soul is what allows martial artists to control Qi, geniuses have faster soul growth than others. The soul grows fastest in the first 20 percent of a martial artist’s life. As a martial artist becomes more accomplished in their cultivation their lifespan increases, letting them extend their souls growth rate.
 
If a person has more Qi inside their body than their soul can handle, it can become loose and destroy their internal organs or even their cultivation. This is a side effect from raising cultivation through artificial means.
 
Mental demons or shock may affect a cultivator’s soul. As a result, most cultivators try to be true to themselves.
 
The only way to cultivate the soul is by learning, fighting, or surviving life-or-death trials. Because of digesting the soul of the plant when eating some medicines, it can result in growth of the soul. However, stabilization of the current cultivation is needed to make the soul their own. Also works with powerful pills and beast spirits. Dangerous because if the soul fragments are too powerful it can even kill the cultivator.
Items
Voids Hand: A mysterious glove that was passed down from patriarch to patriarch. Inside is the library that can be shared with anyone. Anybody that tries to tell someone about the technique they learn from the library will instantly forget. This is also where the soul of Master Ti Wu lives in.
 
Spider of a Thousand Tricks Necklace: A necklace that creates a cocoon of silk around the cultivator. If penetrated the cultivator will be randomly teleported to a location within a thousand miles. Works 3 times a week before needing to be recharged.
 
Spatial Ring: A ring that contains a small pocket dimension
Living Steel Hammer: An as of yet unnamed hammer that was bestowed to Chu Shen by Master Lang. It contains 2 inscriptions that allow the hammer to change its weight and allow easier channeling of Qi.
Mirror of The Void: A robot Chu Shen has created for the tournaments in Arc 2.
Terms
Realms: Different Dimensions that may have different universal laws or the same laws.
Heavenly Treasure Pavilion: A mysterious pavilion that leads to a pocket dimension/realm. The Chu Sect was using this to test their disciples. Inside are Pagoda’s that contain many weapons. The Pagoda’s are separated into realms.
 
Blacksmith: Forges weapons
 
Inscription Master: Lays inscriptions on weapons, giving them special effects.
 
Artificer: Combination of blacksmithing and Inscription master.
 
Array Master: Lays down arrays that can have special effects on the surrounding world.
 
Beast Core: A beast’s version of a dantian. The outside of the beasts dantian is formed of solid material, usually crystal. It contains the beasts Qi inside it. As a result, if a beast is killed before it wastes its Qi in defense, it will have more energy than one that doesn’t.
 
Artificers are ranked according to the highest star array they can assimilate into a weapon they have forged.
 
Inscription masters are ranked by the highest star array they can assimilate into a weapon.
 
Blacksmiths are separated into the highest Tier weapon they can forge.
 
Hyperspace: Means of faster than light travel inside the Sci-Fi realm
Places
Chu branch sect Misty Pass: Chu Shen’s hometown. A small out of the way town on the border of the forest.
Majestic Sword Academy: A prestigious school that trains students run by the Chu Sect. Unlike other schools this one is available to all those who are talented and not just nobles. Outstanding students may be invited to join the Chu Sect by the teachers.
Sparta: A planet that is run by scientists. Scared of being hunted down by the Pure Ones, a radical religious group, they founded a militaristic nation. They are the most advanced group in the entire Human Galaxy.
