<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 1</h1>

I jerked the controls left, barely avoiding the orange ball of star-hot plasma that shot past. “Sam!” I yelled over the comms. “When’s the Navy going to get here?!”
“Two minutes!” Sam yelled back.
“That long!” I yelled at the same time as I fired the thrusters on the side of the ship. It carved out a swooping arc in the air, bolts of energy passing by our ion trail.
“I can’t shake them!” I yelled. “These pirates are getting to be crackshots with all the practice we’re giving them!” I pulled back, causing the ship to shoot upwards, narrowly dodging the EMP blast.
For another tense minute I swerved, weaved, bobbed, ducked, and generally pulled every trick I learned from my days as a fighter pilot in the Navy. The only thing keeping me from blacking out was the inertia dampeners. They used artificial gravity to counteract the g-force from my insane maneuvers.
“The Navy called! They said they’re going to warp into the system in thirty seconds!” Sam yelled from the co-pilot's bubble.
“Great! Now hold on!” With that warning, I cut the engine and fired the rear bottom thrusters. Flipping the ship backwards, I reactivated the engine and all the rear thrusters, giving us that little bit of extra kick. The inertia dampeners whined as it tried to deal with the hundreds of extra g’s i was subjecting the ship to. I was pushed back into my seat, almost blacking out from the extreme force, as some of the g-force bleed through.
The three pirate fighters that were in pursuit shot past us as we decelerated at a tremendous rate. Then, in a flash of white light, a huge rectangular ship with hatches and bulges sticking out of its hull appeared a mile above and five hundred yards to the front right of my ship
The pirate fighters, which were banking to come after us, lit up their engines and flew directly away from the Navy destroyer. Five hatches on the destroyer opened and missiles launched out of them, a plume of blue ions leaving a beautiful trail behind them.
The pirates banked rapidly, trying to avoid the missiles that were closing in on them. Unfortunately, missiles will forever be more agile than ships with fragile creatures inside. The missiles unleashed an electric-blue sphere of light as they passed the pirate fighters.
The missiles EMP caught the pirate ships, shorting out their shields along with the delicate electronics inside. All three ships flew along, powerless in the void of space. If the pirates weren’t picked up soon, their oxygen would be used up due to their life support being cut-off. The destroyer launched tugs to pick up the fighters and missiles that were coasting to a stop. They couldn’t waste ammunition, not with how low it had been since the third galactic war. While it had ended four years ago, the economy was still trying to recover.
Meanwhile, I started bringing the ship to a stop myself. Once that was done, I took a moment to calm myself. My hands were shaking uncontrollably, the stress and fear consuming me. I had been shaking the entire time I had been piloting. We’d had multiple close controls, all of them much closer since I couldn’t control my fear. Four years ago, that would have been easy. Now, I had a had time just trying to fly a ship. 
I took a deep breath, attempting to control myself. I put on a brave face before calling the Navy destroyer. Unexpectedly, Anna, a very familiar face from my Navy days, appeared on the viewscreen. Her brown eyes widened in shock. As we stared at each other, I took in the captain bars displayed prominently on her military cap, her brunette hair hidden underneath. 
Anna recovered quickly, immediately getting down to business. “Hello Lone Wolf. Glad we could be of service. Were they able to damage your vessel?” Her formal tone seemed to indicate that she wanted to keep it business like, but the smirk on her face said otherwise.
Anna had been the captain of the carrier that I’d been assigned to during the galactic war. I doubted anyone else would be able to talk to her so casually, due to her status. We had both been honored with medals for our services during the war. I’d retired but Anna had decided to continue working for the Navy, though she had refused any promotions.
I smiled at her. “Nah, these mangy pirates weren’t able to scratch an old wardog like me, Centurion.”
She smiled back at me. “As expected from my ex-ace fighter. And what’s this talk about being old, you’re still in your late twenties.”
Sam appeared on a separate viewscreen. His blue eyes twinkling mischievously, his blonde hair hanging down around his shoulders. “But darling, what about me? Don’t I get some loving too?”
Anna quickly waved here hand. “Oh no. Nothing for you, grease monkey. When are you going to get a haircut? I know that your hair isn’t up to standard.”
Sam shrugged. “I’m not in the Navy anymore sweetheart. Don’t need to worry about the regulations anymore, one of the perks of going solo.”
Anna smirked. “Uh-huh. Anyways, where are you headed next?”
I shrugged. “Just delivering some mining tools. Should be back in the Veltrus System within a week though.”
She smiled. “Great, I have shore leave then. How about we catch up then, for old times sake?”
Sam immediately piped up. “Sure. I think we should be free, right man?”
I shrugged helplessly. “Fine. Let’s meet on the Lunar Station, Deck 3 Bay 5. Does next Monday at five pm local time sound good?”
Anna nodded. “Perfect. Until then, Centurion out.” The viewscreen disappeared. Sam whistled on the remaining viewscreen.
“Alright, it’s a date then. So Tony, you gonna spiff up for our daaate?” Sam asked teasingly.
I sighed.“Shut up Sam!” I yelled at him. Man, Sam sure was annoying sometimes. 
“Sir yes sir!”
Abou twenty minutes later, I could hear Sam’s impressed voice. “Wow those tugs are fast. It’s not easy moving that much weight with a small engine. The Navy destroyer warped out. Dang, those souped up tachyon drives sure do let them warp in a lot deeper in the system. I’m so jealous.”
I sighed before saying, “Me too Sam. Especially since we have to be 450 million miles from Veltrus’ star. Speaking of which, when are we going to cross the warp boundary Sam?”
“Let me see... “ Sam trailed off as I heard a few beeps. “Ah, here it is. We’re still about twelve thousand miles from the warp boundary. We should be able to warp out in an hour.”
“Okay. Tell me when we can warp then.” I went and got a cup of tea from the mess. I needed something to calm my nerves and tea did it just about every time.
“We’re ready to go Tony. Fire it up!” Sam called out.
“Let’s go then,” I said. “Off to the Delgatho mining system.” The tachyon drive opened up, capturing a load of tachyon particles. The viewscreen flashed white as we entered warpspace, the radiation from the dimensional travel blinding the sensors and releasing a flash of light. The tachyon particles would allow us to travel as far as we wanted until we dumped the charge or the tachyon particles decayed inside the tachyon drive.
Gravity interfered with tachyon particles, making them unstable. This caused ships to be unable to enter or exit warp space when strong gravity was present. If you tried, you’d end up exiting warp space at the very edge of the gravity field. This could be resolved with better tachyon drives though, allowing jumps closer to the Sun and planets. Asteroids would cause tachyon drives to be unusable within a mile or two, just a couple seconds of flight in space.
The pirates had laid in wait along a popular lane to the warp boundary, using an asteroid as cover. Fortunately the Navy had better tachyon drives and we were really close to the warp boundary, otherwise I’m not sure that it would have ended as nicely as it did. 
Sam cracked his neck before talking to me. “Alright, now we have another four hours before we reach the coordinates.” He pulled himself through the entrance hatch, floating through the air. I undid my buckles and floated up myself. Unfortunately, the power drain to stabilize the tachyon particle was too severe to power the artificial gravity except for inside the cabins and mess hall. Of course, large ships wouldn’t have this problem with their bigger reactors.
“I’ll be in my room if you need me Sam,” I called down the hallway as Sam floated away. “Going to catch up on the news I downloaded in Veltrus.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Sam waved dismissively as he sat down in the pilot seat. The view screen’s holographic display lit up with a diagnostic scan of the ship. Sam started to study it, muttering about how space jocks didn’t know the pain of grease monkeys.
I smiled at that. That was just like Sam. He was like that even back in the Navy when he was my engineer for my fighter. Sam had also been cross-trained in navigation and sensors during the time at the Navy. He loved learning how to use the equipment he serviced. 
After I retired, Sam decided to tag along. He chipped in with repairs and maintenance on our ship, so I put up with him. I used the money I had saved during my service to buy a small cargo ship. The rest of my money was in savings until I could finally buy a bigger hauler, one that had better engines and some guns. I always felt so vulnerable in this defenseless coffin, it didn’t even have a tractor beam. We made small cargo runs to different systems in our little hauler, making a tidy profit from deliveries.
I went to my room, floating until I opened the door. Adjusting myself, I floated in while orienting myself with the floor, catching myself when I fell to the ground. I caught a glimpse of my blonde hair in the mirror, a flash of blue as my eyes drifted over the silvered surface. 
Going back to the mirror, I inspected my image. My body was rail-thin and tall, almost seven feet. My hair was a dirty blonde, closer to a brown color honestly. My eyes were a greyish blue with little flecks of green close to the middle. My abnormal height was just one of the side-effects of being born on an asteroid mine. The company that ran the asteroid field didn’t want to pay the expenses of keeping a gravity generator running at top capacity, so the gravity was 0.8 that of earth’s, causing my bones to become thin and brittle, though that was only compared to earthers.
Compared to Sam though, I was still short. Sam grew up on Mars. Because he lived in the 0.6g of the habitat dome, he was actually 8ft tall. Due to nanite infusions, his bones were reinforced enough to still walk around normally in earth gravity, though he would become tired very easily. I was lucky compared to Sam. The only thing I had needed was some calcium supplements. Those nanite infusions were extremely painful. I’d heard them described as every bone in your body catching on fire simultaneously.
Sam also had blonde hair, though his was a very light blonde. His eyes were a hazelnut color and there were some laughter lines around his eyes. Physically, we weren’t too much alike. Still, it was enough to were some people might mistake us as distant cousins. 
Shaking my head, I walked past the mirror before sitting down in the chair in the corner of the room. Opening up the metal case on the stand next to me, I put on the E-Glasses and pulled up the news I downloaded in the Veltrus System.
It was mostly garbage. New politician elected, such and such planetary rules revisited, local marathon, local astrology and weather reports. The basics. About the only thing out of the ordinary was the large amount of pirates. Ever since the end of the third galactic war four years ago, many veterans became jobless. Especially those on the Empire’s side who lost the war. As a result, thousands of marines and ex-pilots turned to piracy to make an income. Unfortunate. Most likely some of my squadmates would be mixed in with the riff-raff.
Of more concerning news was the rumors that remnants of the empire were getting organized. Apparently, an intercepted message from an ex-Admiral of the Imperials had leaked out. The Federation had made an official announcement about it, but there were many news outlets that were covering the story anyway.
I zoned out as I started thinking what this meant for the Federation until a small beep sounded. Sam’s voice came on the internal comms. The space suit I had on integrated all of my comm systems, such as the ones on the ship or on public networks, into one system. All I had to do was specify who I wanted to reach and it would call them for me. “Tony, we’re coming out of warp in five minutes.” Huh. How time flies when you’re busy.
Sighing, I got up with a groan and headed to the mess hall, pulling myself along the handlebars in the hallway. Repeating my trick, I landed on my feet and grabbed a couple slices of Salami from the fridge. Munching on them, I set off for the cockpit. Pulling myself past the door, I noticed Sam was still sitting down in my chair. “Hey! Get out Sam! That’s my chair!”
Sam jumped in shock. Unfortunately, he didn’t strap himself in so he shot upwards like a rocket, hitting his head on the ceiling. Rubbing his head he glared at me. “You know you could have asked me nicely.”
I shrugged unapologetically. “But where's the fun in that. Anyways, get to the co-pilot's bubble. I need you to handle the sensors and comms.”
Sam huffed a bit but still set off for the co-pilot’s bubble. Sitting down in my chair, I pulled up my usual interface on the view screen.  He kept the seat nice and warm. Way to go Sam.
I looked out the view screen at the space around us. It was the solid white of warpspace. The timer in the upper right corner of the screen reached zero. Immediately the white space pulsed brightly as we dropped the tachyon particle, exciting the warpspace instantly. Then, the white shifted to become a field of stars, along with a bunch of asteroids.
The view screen flashed red, alarms blaring. Even without looking at the sensors, I knew what the problem was. A large portion of my viewscreen was covered by a hunk of space rock. Quickly glancing at the sensors for any asteroids heading for me, I banked upwards avoiding the looming asteroid. A baseball sized chunk of rock whizzed by as I dodged another asteroid.
Cursing our lack of current navigation data, I started flying by the seat of my pants. Keeping one eye on the sensors and another on the viewscreen, I began dodging asteroids frantically. I could barely anticipate the trajectories of some asteroids using this method and others were too small for me to catch before they hit us, dropping our shields down rapidly. “Sam! What in blue blazes is going on!” I yelled.
“No idea!” He sounded pretty frantic. “We somehow warped into the middle of an asteroid field! I’m scanning for the edge of it now!”
Luckily, an asteroid field is pretty spread out. Each large asteroid, most of which were a mile or two long, were separated by hundreds of miles. The real problems though were the fast moving, small chunks of rock and metal that filled the vast space between the asteroids. They were spawned by the occasional collision between asteroids and, unfortunately, this one was unusually dense, resulting in a much larger amount of cosmic debris.
Finally, the view screen lit up with a series of green arrows. A suggested velocity was blinking in the top left of the screen. “Alright Tony, I have a path leading outside the asteroid field. Go ahead and get us out of this mess!”
“Ok partner, will do.” I trusted Sam’s calculations since he was using the programs he created. I had used them to navigate battlefields during the galactic war, back when he had been my engineer. He had proven himself, and his skills, trustworthy many times.
I activated the thrusters, speeding up to the velocities shown for the translucent green path. Banking, rising, twisting, turning. I followed the highly convoluted path outside the asteroid field. Sometimes asteroids would pass less than ten feet from our forcefield. As a matter of fact, our forcefield flared up a couple times, deflecting fist asteroids.
But within five nerve wracking minutes, we were out of the asteroid field. Letting out a breath I didn’t know I was holding, I sunk into my chair, exhausted. Dodging pirates and asteroids can take a lot out of someone. I turned on the autopilot. It would keep us away from all objects on the sensor, though it would have been overloaded in the asteroid field since there were so many objects to track.
I got up and walked out of the pilot’s bubble, meeting Sam in the mess hall. Artificial gravity was automatically restored when we exited warpspace, otherwise I couldn’t have pulled all those fancy maneuvers without becoming a puddle of goo from the extreme g’s they brought on.
We stared at each other for a little bit. Finally, I broke the silence. “What happened Sam? This is most definitely not the Delgatho mining system.”
Sam shrugged. “I don’t know either, let me pull up the nav data.” Sam had on his black, skin tight flight suit, same as I did. Reaching out, Sam activated the mess halls holo-projectors pulling up the mess halls view screens. His suit’s gloves gave him tactical feedback, giving him the impression that he was touching something. That was how everyone's view screens worked.
Sam tapped at it for a bit while I waited impatiently. Sam finally looked up. “Well, the systems nav data does not line up with any other known system. The computer used the stars to place us at over ten light years outside the frontier.
I swore for a bit. “Dang it Sam! I know this shipment was supposed to be on the very edge of the frontier, but this is uncharted territory! Even the Navy’s probes only go five light years beyond the frontier. We can’t be out here!” The frontier was a border of space that was unexplored. The probes would constantly expand the border, letting us know if there were any alien civilizations that we needed to watch out for. Explorers were allowed to jump to any systems inside the border, but going beyond it was something that endangered all of humanity. It was a capital offense, one punishable by death.
There is a very good reason for that specific rule about not going beyond the frontier. When tachyon drives were first mass produced, the various colonies and business of Earth started desperately claiming planets as their own. A small colony ship owned by a civilian cruise company started attempting to colonize a planet they found. Turns out, that planet was the property of an alien empire. They didn't take too kindly to being invaded and wiped out the human colonists. They then proceeded to attack the rest of humanity. This lead to the call for unity and the Federation was born in order to unite humanity. This was also the start of the first Galactic War.
The number one rule of the Federation upon its creation was that none were to pass beyond the border of explored space. The Federation's Navy would explore for them and approve of planets for colonization. All of this was to prevent another galactic war from breaking out.
After humanity finished the fight, there were many calls for the aliens to be wiped out. The aliens weren't against destroying civilians and entire planets were left devastated. There was a vote and 52% of the Federations ruling body was against it. The 48% that were for the genocide of the aliens were livid. They declared independence, eventually becoming the empire.
A second Galactic war was fought after the Empire and Federation separated, a war with the corporations. The Empire wanted control of all wealth inside their territory, stating that it would be necessary to protect themselves from any alien threat. The Federation simply wanted to stop several different monopolies from ripping them off with their high fuel, construction, and maintenance costs that they demanded the public and the Federation pay. While smaller in casualties than the first galactic war, the second galactic war had a much larger political backlash. 
The agents of the monopolies twisted the media reports in the Federation, making the public believe that it was actually the Federation that was evil. In the Empire, the media was taken over and spread propaganda about the evil of owning your own business. 
While the media tactics delayed the inevitable, the Federation was finally able to get the truth out due to several news networks that actually reported the truth. Performing several attacks at once, they managed to get ahold of the secrets of those monopolies. They spread the secrets to the whole galaxy before sitting back and letting economics do the rest of their work for them.
As for the Empire, they were able to successfully take over the private sector. It was because of this that they were able to appropriate many different scientific studies and conduct research on military weaponry. While it took a while, the Empire was able to gain a technological advantage over the Federation. It made the Empire bold, causing them to make the first move to start the third Galactic War.
Sam shrugged. “I know we aren’ supposed to be beyond the border, but here we are. Let me check the coordinates.” After a couple quick taps, Sam looked up, grinning sheepishly.
“Well? What did you find out?” I demanded.
“Wellllll. I put the coordinates into the tachyon drive during the fight. When I did that, I may have added an extra zero onto the coordinates.”
“....”
“....”
“Seriously?” I asked Sam, an incredulous expression on my face. Sam shrugged helplessly.
“I’m fraid so.” I was about to tear into him. We were almost killed over such a basic mistake like that! Right as I started to yell at him, an alarm sounded.
Beeep. Beeep. Beeep.
The alarm was faint but at a very high pitched tone. Alarmed, we simultaneous darted to our stations. When I got there, none of the controls were lit up. Everything showed greed on my end. Confused, I activated the comms and called Sam. “You got anything?”
“Nope. I think it might be coming from the cargo bay.”
I groaned. “God I hope not. This day is already bad enough. I’ll check on it, you keep an eye on things here.”
“Alright.” I immediately headed to the cargo bay. Sure enough, the alarm got louder the closer I got. Pressurizing the cargo bay, I went inside. Nothing was askew as far as I could see. The alarm was coming from the large metal structure strapped down on the edge of the bay.
I practically screamed in frustration the second I saw it. It just had to be a problem with this thing. The ‘thing’ I was referring to was a mineral scanner. It was also the most expensive thing in the manifest. Going over, I accessed the interface which was blaring red. 
Then, I just stared at it in shock.


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 2</h1>

“Sam, get to the cargo bay pronto.” My voice came out monotone, too shocked to put the emotions I felt into my voice.
“Why Tony? You got a problem the great Ace fighter can’t handle?” While the comment seemed sarcastic, his tone conveyed his playful intentions. I wasn’t in the mood.
“Sam, for once in your life, stop the sarcastic comments and listen to me.”
“Fine.” I could hear the hurt in his voice but right now I didn’t care. Sam soon came down the cargo bay ramp.
He threw up his hands when he saw me. “What. What do you want?” I said nothing except to point at the mineral scanner. Seeing it, Sam groaned. “Now I see why you were so short. Fine, I’ll try and fix it.” I shook my head and pointed at the scanners viewscreen.
Sam glanced at it for a second. He leaned forward, seeming to take it seriously now. After looking at it for a few seconds, his jaw went through the hull. “T-T-Tony? Have you seen these reports?” I nodded. “This thing says within a thousand miles there are three thousand tonnes of gold, fifteen thousand tonnes of platinum and a couple thousand tonnes of other precious metals.”
“I know Sam, that’s why I called you. While I fly by the asteroid field, you keep an eye on the this things readouts, record it on a datastick.” Sam nodded a bit stiffly like he was still in shock. Heck, I was still in shock!
Leaving the cargo bay for the cockpit, I deactivated the autopilot once I arrived. I kept the asteroid tracker on though. Using the software, I was able to avoid asteroids on the fringe of the asteroid field. After ten minutes of slow flying, Sam called me on the intercom. “Tony, the readings aren’t changing. They are actually picking up denser deposits.”
I just kind of fell into my chair. This discovery was…. I wasn’t sure how to describe it. All I knew was that this was going to change our lives forever. Whether that change was good or bad, I could only guess at the moment. Finally I replied back. “Sam, we need to meet in the mess hall.”
	“Sure, Tony. This…. This requires some planning.” We both arrived in the mess hall. By some unspoken agreement, we avoided the mine laden topic of the scans. Instead, I started brewing coffee while Sam heated up some food. After it was done cooking, we sat down and ate, saying nothing. Everything tasted like sand.
I burped and sat back in my chair. Swirling my coffee, I gulped down the last mouthful. I surveyed my plate. It was empty, even the chicken bones were picked clean. I sighed. Looks like I couldn’t put it off any longer. I glanced up at Sam. He was in the same predicament.
Finally, I took the plunge. “Pretty unbelievable huh Sam? All those tonnes of ore just sitting there in a huge ring of space rock.” I gave him a half-hearted grin.
Sam sighed and nodded. “Definitely. So, what do you think we should do about this?”
“Well, what are our options? Let’s start with that.” I said, nodding decisively.
“First option, ignore it. It’s illegal to go beyond the border into unexplored space. Not to mention information on a resource like this is deadly. Bigger forces have been killed for far less.” Sam held up one finger as he listed the details.
“Second option,” Sam lifted up another finger as he talked. “We tell the U.F. (United Federation). Even though it’s illegal they would probably pardon us since it was an accident. Plus, we could expect a nice paycheck thrown our way. There is a shortage of metals since the third galactic war, so such a discovery like this would really help bolster our economy. The downside is that they may kill us instead so that they can keep the deposit secret but I doubt it. They know you can keep a secret since you were in the military before this, plus, you are a hero.”
Sam held up a third finger. “Another option is that we sell it to a private party. Some mining corporations would pay dearly for information like this. Again though, it would be dangerous. They could try to kill us to keep it secret.”
He held up another finger, making it four in total. “Finally, we could mine it ourselves. Take a couple tonnes here or there and get rich off of it. We would have to keep it secret, maybe buy the rights to mine some asteroid fields to disguise the fact we are mining here.” Sam spread his hands. “That’s all I got so far. Any suggestions?”
I shook my head. “No, I think you covered it all.”
Sam leaned forward on the table. “So... what do you think we should do?”
I shrugged. “No idea. All of those are feasible plans. I haven’t been following the military news recently so I don’t know the political situation. It’s also been two years since the war, so most people have forgotten about me being a hero, especially since I was purposely trying to hide. I’m not sure how well received we would be if we told the U.F. about this mineral deposit.”
Sam nodded. “Alright, I agree. So I say we mark this spot down on the map and get out for now. We need to make our deliveries on time, otherwise we’ll look suspicious. I can replace the hard drive for the mineral scanner and replicate the software so that the scans aren’t found on it. If the scans are found, we would be in deep trouble.”
I nodded. “It’s best that we do it quickly. We can always use the excuse that we checked up on the cargo after the pirates attacked us. It is true afterall, and we have the records to prove the pirate attack.”
	“Agreed.” Sam stood up and started walking down the hallway as he talked. I quickly joined him, leaving the plates for a less busy time. “I’ll get started on changing the hardware right away. You go ahead and plot the course for the Delgatho system while I get everything done.”
	“Yeah, it’s best if you let me put in the coordinates.” I elbowed him lightly in the side. “I don’t want to warp to another section of uncharted space.” 
	Sam smiled at me. “Well, maybe it would be better if I put in the coordinates. Who knows? We might discover another alien civilization!”
	I smiled back at him. It was good that Sam was back to his usual sarcastic, goofy self. It was a lot better than that serious face he had on earlier. “Yeah well, I’m still putting in the coordinates. I don’t want to start another war with some aliens.” Leaving Sam chuckling in the hallway, I headed for the pilot bubble and started inputting the coordinates in preparation of the jump. We were already beyond the warp boundary, otherwise we wouldn’t have been able to warp into the system, so there wasn’t any problems on that end. Whenever I had the coordinates we would be ready to go..
	I pulled up the comms after I was done with my preparations. “Hey Sam, you switched the hard drive around yet?”
	Sams annoyed voice came out of the comm speaker. “Of course not! It’s barely been ten minutes. I just finished getting all my tools together to take off the case of this mineral scanner.”
	I shrugged. “Well, I can take off any moment now. How about I reroute the power that would maintain the artificial gravity in the cabins so that you can keep working on it in warpspace.”
	“Uh, no!” Sam’s distressed voice emerged from the comms. “You do realize that I have some things in my room that I can’t have just floating around. My vanilla milkshake, for example.”
	I lifted an eyebrow at that. “Vanilla milkshake,” I asked, my voice filled with menace. “You said we were out of it when I asked yesterday!”
	“Uhhh. About that… So anyways, could you delay the warp by about twenty minutes.”
	“Yeah I can. But don’t think you’re getting away with this! I’m still mad about that milkshake!”
	“Anyways, bye!” Sam’s comm signal disappeared. 
	“Lying, cheating, thieving sonovagun. Bet he hid some other things too.” I muttered under my breath. I really was upset about that. I bought the milkshake mix when I was on the last station we stopped by. I’d been looking forward to getting the last portion when a certain snake must have taken it.
 I sat in the cockpit bubble, waiting for Sam to get back on the comms. After seventeen minutes, Sam finally called back. “We’re ready to go. Luckily this things computing systems are common. The only thing that makes this thing so expensive is the scanners and they don’t store any information. I had to tear out the computing system from one of the other things back here but I checked the shipping label on it. We were supposed to deliver it to the Starlon System on our way back in two weeks. We have time to buy a replacement. Also, it’s only a computer. It isn’t too expensive to replace.”
I nodded. That was Sam for you, checking everything thoroughly. “Why didn’t you just wipe the computing systems instead of installing a new one.” I had to get this clarified. That’s what I would have done, so I didn’t see why he hadn’t done that.
“Well I could have…. except the gig would have been up if they had pulled the hard drive. Data is never erased from a computer, just the way to access it can be destroyed. If they did a deep scan of the memory banks, they would have found it. It would stick out like a sore thumb since it would have been the only deleted scan as well. It’s better to say that the computing system got damaged from a pirate attack but we replaced it, then to risk them finding it. Also, I incinerated the computing system using the reactor.”
“Great job Sam,” I said, some of the pressure of our discovery finally leaing me. “With that done, no one should be able to find out what we discovered. Anyways, I’m activating the tachyon drive. We should reach the Delgatho Mining System in twenty four minutes.”
“Alright,” Sam said. “It’s your turn to monitor the ship while I finish up the programing transfer down here.”
“Fine,” I replied. “See you in a bit, Sam.”
“You too, buddy.” With a click, he signed off. I activated the tachyon drive, listening to the whine as it kicked in. There was a flash of white light that covered my viewscreen. It dimmed automatically though, so there wasn’t blindness from the intense light. The white light didn’t disappear, staying prominently displayed on the viewscreen.
 It was a clear signal that we were, indeed, in warpspace. Letting out a deep breath, I leaned back in my chair. For next twenty minutes I just sat there. Trying to come to terms with what had happened.
I only came out of my reverie when a tone went off. Stretching my hand out, I shut down the alarm. It was the one that came on to alert the crew that the ship would be exiting warpspace soon. I activated the comms. “Hey Sam, we’re exiting warpspace in less than a minute.”
“Alright Tony, I’ll go ahead and get to my bubble in a second.” Not soon after he got off the comms, I heard a thud followed by Sam cursing. I smiled. Funny how he always seemed to hit his head on random things when he was in a hurry.
The solid white of warpspace that covered my viewscreen pulsed once brightly before it suddenly turned into the black of space with stars randomly dotting the vast expanse. I checked the radar. Nothing was close enough to warrant immediate attention. I turned towards the coordinates and compared them to the ones I had written down.
	I sighed in relief. They matched. This was, indeed, the Delgatho mining system. For some reason, I didn’t trust Sam with putting the coordinates in anymore. Actually, I should have checked them before he put them in. Come to think of it, it did seem like a bad idea to manually put in coordinates and not have someone else check them. Seems like my military training was starting to fade a bit.
	I grinned. Well, I could do with less regulations. Though some regulations make sense, like checking the atmospheric regulator before take off, others made no sense at all, like making sure there wasn’t any damage to the paint after landing. Useless regulations made up by lazy bureaucrats was the exact reason why I decided to leave the army. That and some other, more personal issues.
“Hey Tony! Stop spacing and get going,” Sam yelled. “We need to dock soon or they might get suspicious, ya know?” 
“I know Sam, I know,” exasperation coloring my voice. “Stop nagging me will ya? Sheesh.” I fired up the engine and headed towards the Galactic Surveying & Orbital-mining Corporation (GSOC) station. 
Funny. According to normal logic, the ‘Delgatho Mining System’ should belong to a corporation called Delgatho. But if we went according to that, there would be multiple systems that were called ‘GSOC Mining System 001, GSOC Mining System 002’, and so on and so on. 
Instead whoever discovered the system would name it and the surveyors would then come in and check what the system was viable for. If it was only good for mining, then it would become the ‘xxxxxx- Mining System.’ If it was a system not good for anything it would be the ‘xxxxxxx- Void System’. Things got a bit more complicated if there was a habitable planet. If there were aliens than the entire system would become secluded, not that there were many planets like that. There were a few though and some were on even terms with humanity as well.
If the system was habitable, then ten years after the system’s population reached 10.000 the population would then vote on the name of the system. Of course, many systems gained some weird names from that. Seriously weird names. I mean, who names the system they live in ‘Sparkly Unicorn System’!? I could at least handle the ‘Here Be Dragons System’ but definitely not the ‘Goo Goo Gah System’. That was just too much idiocy. 
A tone went off that was combined with a red button flashing. I locked the heading and thrust before reaching over and tapping it. “This is GSOC Mining Station B-1937, you are approaching us at vector 3.09 horizontal and 50.8 vertical relative to our position. Please state your purpose in approaching or be considered a threat to this station and its inhabitants.”
I rolled my eyes. Great, I was just thinking about how much I hate bureaucratic nonsense and then these guys start on it. I just HATE it. I linked the comms to Sam. “Hey, buddy, you know the drill.”
I heard Sam’s audible sigh come over the comms before he started whining. “Why do I have to deal with these paper pushers?”
“Come on Sam,” I coaxed him. “Just look at it this way. I respect you for being able to understand more than half the things that come out of their mouths. So, my man, just work your wizardry.”
“Sometimes I get the feeling this was the only reason you let me come with you,” Sam said, sounding suspicious. Oops. Did I let too much slip? I can’t let him figure it out!
“Whaaat? Of course not, I also kept you for your amazing engineering skills.”
“Uh-huh. Just patch them through to me.”
“Will do, thanks bud!” Score! I wasn’t sure if it counted, but I was including this in the revenge chart for my milkshake.
I patched the motor mouth from GSOC Mining Station blee bloo blah and let Sam talk his heart out. I was thirty minutes away from docking with the station anyways. Most mining stations were located fairly close to the warp boundary to speed up deliveries. Of course, it also helped that most asteroid belts were close to the warp boundary as well. When the first tachyon drive had come out, ships had to travel to Saturn before reaching the warp boundary.
As a testimony to the long windedness of desk jockeys, I was eleven minutes away from the station whenever they finally got done talking. “Whew. They sure can talk your ear off if you let them.” Came Sam’s exhausted voice.
“Wow Sam, I didn’t know that nineteen minutes could be so exhausting to you.” I think he may have heard the sarcasm on that one.
“How about I let you experience it for yourself next time,” Sam threatened. He sounded serious about it too.
My face twitched.”Uh, how about no.”
“That’s what I thought, tough guy.” While we were joking around, I could still sense an underlying tension. No matter how much we tried, we couldn’t forget our discovery. We didn’t normally clown around this much, but I think it was a coping mechanism. The laughter was helping, but not as much I wanted it too. My shoulders wouldn’t come loose even after I rubbed them for a full five minutes. I shook my head, time to get back to business.
“Anyways Sam, where do I dock, what’s the speed, you know, the usual.”
“Ah don’t worry about it. I got the path up on the guidance system. Go ahead follow it you dumb pilot.”
“Yeah well, if you want this ‘dumb pilot’ to turn down the inertia dampener just enough to knock you out, continue by all means.”
“Hehe. Bring it on, you dumb pilot.” 
I rolled my eyes. “I would, but with your tendency to bonk your head on the ceiling, I think you’ll knock yourself out without my help.”
“I do not.” A smile crept over my face at Sam’s indignant tone.
“Of course you don’t. Anyway, I gotta dock with the station. Be right back.”
“That’s right, you dumb pilot. Just follow my plan.”
I rolled my eyes. “Yeah, like all your plans work out.” When I said that, a silence descended upon us. The accidental discovery simply weighed on us too much for me to even attempt to make a joke of it, even if it had only been a reference.
Taking advantage of the stifling silence, I glanced over the trajectories Sam had laid out. Adjusting the ship and putting the thrusters on a steady backwards burn, I prepared for docking with the station. We were getting put on Deck 60 Bay 12, the lowest deck. Decks were just like floors in a skyscraper while bays were parking garages. 
The station was a very simple rod floating in space, made of dark grey metal with white lights blinking on the outside. The station wasn’t meant to be pretty, it was a mining station after all. The path Sam gave me required me to fly into the large open section at the bottom of the mining station. 
I flew into the open space. Multiple pads were displayed in front of me.Virtual overlays on my screen showed me the bay numbers. I quickly found the landing pad with the number 12 on it. I flew in close, firing the thrusters continuously to slow down the ship. I came to a slight hover just above the landing pad. 
I activated the landing gear and applied a small amount of thrust from the top of the ship. The stumpy metal legs from the bottom of the cargo hauler extended. I felt the thud as they made contact with the station. The magnets on the bottom of the legs allowed the ship to remain stuck to the floor instead of floating off.
In the loading and unloading bays, stations usually didn’t have artificial gravity. This made it easier on pilots since we didn’t have to worry about gravity shifting on us. It also helped keep the station’s costs down due to not needing as much power.
I unbuckled my seat harness and walked back to the cargo bay. Even if gravity wasn’t on in the station, we still had it on our ship. I walked to the very back of the cargo bay, pulling up the ramp’s control system with the holo-projectors. Motors whirred as the ramp started to descend. I tapped the tablet embedded in my suit’s left arm, activating the magnets in my boots.
I could feel the gravity disappearing as I walked down the ramp. My body pushed against my suit, wanting to float upwards, but the magnets in my boots kept me from floating away. Quite a strange sensation. Even after all these years, I still couldn’t get used to it.
A man dressed in a dark grey space suit was floating towards me. He was coming in at a diagonal, aimed towards the floor next to me. Upon nearing me, he slung his hands downwards towards the floor. This caused his body to flip around, his feet making solid contact with the floor. I could hear the metallic thud as his boots latched onto the ground.
The man stood up from the crouch he had been in before turning towards me, extending his hand. I shook it firmly.  “My name is Robert Den,” The man said as he shook my hand. “I’m the inventory manager of the Delgatho Mining System GSOC Mining Station B-1937 Deck 60 Bay 12.”
I grasped his hand, giving him a firm shake. “Captain Delgado of the cargo vessel Lone Wolf.” 
Robert nodded as he let go of my hand. “I’ve been expecting you. You’re behind schedule though, by about a half-hour. Run into any trouble?”
I sighed. “Yeah. We had some pirates attack us while we were cycling our tachyon drive. The Navy came in and took the pirates out but we had to inspect our cargo afterwards.”
Robert sighed. “The pirates are starting to get pretty bad back in the core sectors. Luckily, the fringes aren’t feeling it too much. Odd, huh? You’d expect more pirates to be attacking us. Wonder why.”
“I can answer that,” I replied. “The fringes are too spread out. It can take days traveling from each possible hit and the colonies are often just starting out. Takes too much to get there and for only a little gain. The core though, their defenses are weakened after the galactic war and they have a lot more credits. It’s easier to take out a transport convey in the fringes, but it pays a lot more in the core.” 
Robert nodded. “I see the logic. Guess pirates are willing to risk their lives for more money.”
I nodded back. “That’s why they’re pirates. Anyway, should I send you the manifest?”
“Please do.”
I pulled up the documents on my suit before tapping my left arm to Roberts. The files were transfered on contact. Robert looked at it for a while before nodding. “Everything’s in order. Give me a minute and I’ll have the workers down here to unload the cargo.”
“Will do.”
I clambered back on the ship. Sam was waiting in the cargo bay. “Did he suspect anything?” Sam asked hurriedly.
I wiped off my forehead as I leaned against the side of the cargo bay. My entire body was covered in cold sweat from when I had talked with Robert. I’d kept calm, but it had still been nerve wracking.  “No. He asked why we were late but I told him about the pirates. He understood, thankfully.”
Sam sighed. “Thank god.”
	“Anyway, the workers will be down here to unload everything.”
	“Alright, I’ll go ahead and mark everything they need to take with them.” Sam pulled up cargo manifest with the holo-projectors. The cables that previously strapped down several containers unlatched themselves and retracted into the floor. A soft green light shone in front of the containers that were unlatched. Now the workers would know exactly what to unload.
Sam turned towards me. “So, what should we do now?”
I sighed. “I don’t know. How about we go to Sigma System? I still have a house on Bonth that we can hang out at. Then we can decide what to do. They have mining equipment for sale there if that’s what we decide to do and we need to refuel as well.”
Sam nodded. “Fine. It’ll take around eight days to get there, if I’m remembering correctly.”
“It is, but we still need to deliver the other packages before we can leave. Plus, we’re still meeting Anna ”
	“Oh yeah, almost forgot. I’ll try to take a nap then, the chase with the pirates tired me out.”
“See ya later.” I watched as Sam left the cargo bay before I shook my head. Sam didn’t handle stress well. I’d noticed it during the war whenever we were going to battles that were extremely dangerous. He’d get nervous and start experiencing some anxiety. Not only that, he would also become extremely tired.
That was the reason why I had volunteered to stay down in the cargo bay. Just by looking into his eyes, I could tell how much it had tired him out, even if it had only been an hour since we found the asteroid. I knew he’d need a break and I wasn’t going to force him, we were too close for me to try and push him.
I sat down on one of the crates nearby while I was waiting for the workers to get there. About ten minutes later, there came a knock. Walking over to the ramp, I could see five men standing by my ship. A large mover was lay on the ground beside them. The one in that had knocked on the ship waved at me. “Captain Delgado, laborer Hank requesting permission to board.”
I waved them inside.“Come on in.” The whole requesting permission thing was a courtesy that was taken quite seriously throughout the entire galaxy. It was considered massively disrespectful to get on a ship without asking for permission first. You could be arrested for trespassing and no one would even take a second look if you were shot for boarding a ship without permission.
Once they climbed into the cargo bay I turned towards Hank. “All the crates that needing moving are glowing green like this one.” I pointed to a crate beside me. “Any that aren’t glowing are going to somewhere else.”
Hank nodded. “Great. That really helps.” He turned to the four men behind him. “You heard him, get to work fellers.”
The five men spread out, finding all the crates that had a green light in front of them. Once they saw all the boxes, they got to work. Two of them would grab a box, starting with the large boxes.Then they would haul the box outside to the mover, their magnetic feet constantly activated to prevent them from floating off when they stepped into zero-g. The fifth person, Hank, would grab the boxes and strap them down to the mover, preventing them from floating off.
The work went quickly while all I had to do was supervise. I simply made sure they were grabbing the right boxes. In about twenty minutes, they had unloaded all fifty boxes. Hank presented a tablet to me. It had a document with a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo about how I had overseen each package removed and that I confirmed they were the right ones. I signed off on it before going back into my ship. I closed the ramp before going back into the ship.
We would have to stay until they confirmed the cargo’s contents and cross-checked them with the manifest. Afterwards, we would probably go and deliver the rest of our packages. Then we’d go to the Sigma System and decide what to do about the asteroid field.
I went back to my room and put my E-Glasses on. Pulling up a game, I lost myself in the digital world. I had just got done ordering my farm to harvest the apple orchard when the tone went off. The mining station had just sent the confirmation and sent the funds to my bank.
Sending back a short confirmation of payment, I went to the pilot bubble and opened the comms. “Sam! Time to leave!”
A groan came from the comms before Sam’s sleepy voice sounded. “I’ll be up in a second Tony. Just, just give me a second to wake up.
“No pressure buddy. Don’t fall back asleep though.”
“I won’t.”
About five minutes later, I heard Sam cursing as he knocked his head against something. I smirked. That was the Sam I knew. That simple gesture was the most reassuring thing I had heard all day.
The comm activated as Sam said “Alright, I’m ready. Prep for take off while I get the navigational data pulled up.”
I nodded, even if he couldn’t see me. I reached up and started flipping switches. I started announcing the steps as I prepped. “Warming up engines.” The ship hummed as I set the reactor to full blast. “Checking ship integrity.” On the screen to the left of me was an outline of the ship. A green line passed from one end of the image to the other. The outline, which was previously black, turned green. “Ship integrity at a hundred percent.”
Sam’s voice came over the comms. “I’ve got the nav-data. Go ahead and launch.”
“Alright. Releasing clamps.” The ships magnetic landing gear turned off.  “Minimal thrust deployed.” Small jets of iridescent plasma fired from the bottom of the ship. It started to float upwards from the miniscule thrust.
I double-checked the heading the Sam had laid out for me.  “Secondary engine at 10% thrust.” I felt a brief pressure before the inertia dampeners kicked in. Announcing everything I did was a throwback to my days in the Navy. It was comforting, having that training to rely on. Of course, I’d ignore all of it in combat, but it was still nice to slip back into old habits every now and then.
We slowly slid out of the space station. After we were a couple hundred miles away, I activated the engines at a hundred percent. The inertia dampeners weren’t sluggish this time. They were programmed to kick in once a certain g-force had been reached. If it hadn’t passed .9gs, the inertia dampeners would leave it. We normally kept the ship at .8g, a high setting since both of us were born on low-gravity fields.
We still had a way to go before reaching the warp boundary so I double checked the manifest. Just after I finished, we reached the warp boundary. “Alright Sam, next stop is the Warden System. Dropping off some high-end electronics.”
“Sweet. Any pressing delivery stops after that?”
“We’ve got two more after that and then we can end for the day. Need to top off our atmo and fuel when we get to Warden though.”
“Fine. What’s the last stop? I think shore leave would be great.”
“The Voltrax Mining System.”
Sam’s voice was filled with outrage. “A mining system? Ugh. Those places are always so dull though!”
“We could probably get a Zero-G court though, play a few games? Whaddaya say?”
Sam sighed. “Okay. It isn’t the worst suggestion I’ve heard all day, though I doubt it’ll work.”
“Oh come on, don’t be such a pessimist. I’m sure we can get a court.”
I punched in the coordinates and activated the tachyon drive. The viewscreen darkened before showing the bland white of warpspace. It would be two and a half hours until we arrived at Warden. 
“Hey Sam. What are you going to do to pass the time?” I called out.
“I was thinking about taking a nap but I could play some chess if you’re interested.”
“Great. Let’s do it.”
I unstrapped my harness. Sam met me in the hallway and together we walked to the gally. Once there, Sam opened up a cabinet and pulled out a worn box with glass chess pieces inside it. It was our go-to when we were on long trips. I had found that if I couldn’t destroy Sam in the beginning, he would always win in the end game.
We set up the board and started playing. I used my knights and bishops to blitz Sam’s pawns. Sam used his rooks and Queen to set-up a solid defense. Soon, we had both suffered many losses. Unfortunately, most of Sam’s losses were pawns and a few more important pieces. I was definitely on the losing end.
Sam was boxing me in, his queen constantly putting me in check. I was edging towards the inevitable when the alarm went off. Relieved, I ran out of the galley towards the pilot bubble. Sam raged behind me, yelling down the corridor. “You coward! There’s still a minute left, come back and finish!”
“No way!” I called over my shoulder, “I say we just call it a tie.”
“Why you!” Sam’s outraged voice called out. “At least have the decency to pick up your pieces!” I laughed as I strapped myself into the seat. The countdown for the tachyon drive had just reached 50 seconds.
“Sam, might wanna strap in.” I warned him. “We’re coming in two hundred miles from the planet.” Sam curses flew down the hallway. I chuckled before getting serious. Soon, we exited warpspace.
Before us was a brown marble hanging in space. This was the planet Warden, the Navy Outpost for the Frontier, this section of it at least. The planet was actually only a hundred miles from the warp boundary. That meant that the Navy, with their better engines, could actually jump straight to the planet. 
Most Navy outposts were within a thousand miles of the Warp Boundary, easily allowing Navy ships to jump to the outpost right away. This allowed them to patrol areas far easier and react to distress signals faster. It was a regulation that I agreed with whole-heartedly and it had saved me during the war as well.
A stern voice came over the comms the second I dropped out of warpspace. “Attention unidentified vessel, this is a restricted space. Lockdown all turrets and send verification. Any sudden movements will be classified as hostile threat and we are authorized to take action.”
I raised my eyebrow. This was a little over the top for the Navy, normally they simply requested that the ship remain still until they could provide verification. The warning about firing on us if we moved seemed paranoid. “Sam? You got this?”
“Yeah. I just gotta get everything in order here.”
The comm lit up again. “You have one minute to provide verification. If you cannot or will not comply, than be prepared to be boarded.”
Sam’s annoyed voice came on over the comms. “Just hold it for a second. I was in the mess hall when we jumped alright? Here, I just sent you the ship license and cargo manifest. We just so happen to be delivering cargo to you, be a little happier.”
There was a pause before the stern voice came back on. This time it was a little softer, but it was more like a downgrade from broken glass to sandpaper. “Verification checks out. You are clear to land on Warden. I’m sending you a vector to the spaceport. Follow it or you will be shot for violating United Federation airspace.”
I sighed. “Captain Tony Delgado of the cargo hauler Lone Wolf acknowledges the request and will follow your directions.” After answering, I turned off the comm.
Sam’s irritated huff showed just what he thought of our greeting. “Tony, did you hear that guy? I don’t normally get so irritated but he managed to do it. If he knew he was talking to the hero of Kaleesh, he wouldn’t be so smug.”
“Sam, knock it off. If the Navy is being so cautious with even a cargo hauler, than something must be wrong. That guy was just trying to do his job, it’s nothing to get worked up about.”
“I know but it still rubs me the wrong way.”
I sighed. “Get over it Sam. We’ve still got some stuff to do.”
“Fine.” Came Sam’s curt response. I didn’t pay any attention to it. So long as Sam stopped harping on the dude, I didn’t mind. Complaining was fine, I didn’t like the guy either. However, I was more concerned with the raised security than anything else.
 During the voyage to Warden, we passed by five frigates and two destroyers that were currently holding above Warden. It was a fairly good number of ships for such an out of the way outpost.
The ship started to shake as we hit atmosphere. Our cargo ship was shaped like a brick and was simply not meant for aerodynamics. I let gravity pull the ship downwards, not wanting to waste the fuel. The navigational shields helped disperse the friction from the plummet but even still, the belly of the ship turned slightly red as the heat from entering the atmosphere overwhelmed the shields. The ship shook as we fell through the atmosphere.
I activated the thrusters when I was six miles above the surface of Warden. The ship was able to overcome its velocity by the time we were a mile above the spaceport. Following the navy-officer-with-a-stick-up-his-butt’s flight plan, I extended the landing gear and brought the ship to a slow hover above the designated tarmac below. Lowering the thrust, I landed gently on the runway. I could see close to twenty fighters parked on the tarmac around us.
	It was pretty much the standard operating procedure after that. A navy officer along with several workers came out and greeted us before boarding our ship.  They took the military-grade processors and computer chips using the simple pallet they brought. After confirming payment, I asked for a departure flight path and soon we were on our way.	
	We had just cleared the atmosphere when Sam decided to pipe-up. “Hey Tony, I thought we were going to get some fuel and atmo at Warden?”
	I face palmed. “Yeah, yeah we were.” I groaned before glancing at the system. “Well, we should be okay by all standards. We’ll be running kinda low but we’ll definitely have enough to make it to all our stops. How about you remind me next time?”
	Sam’s impish voice came over the comms. “How about you pick up your chess pieces next time.” 
I grimaced. “Touche.” He was certainly getting cheeky, that much was for certain.
The next stop was Void System 0319. The system had a binary star and two rocky planets. Due to the planets’ closeness to the sun and their surface temperatures, mining operations were considered limited. A research station was holding orbit above the twin suns. I wasn’t quite sure what they were researching, but I knew they paid a lot to replace their equipment.
We didn’t touch down this time but attached to clamps on the outside of the station. I decompressed the cargo bay, venting the atmosphere out. A person pushing a large rectangular object flew out of an airlock on the station. The person’s flight adjusted as he closed in, a jet of iridescent plasma from the object slowing him down.
The comms activated. “Hailing the ship Lone Wolf. My name is Garrett Houldon and I am currently doing EVA with a hauler outside your ship. Please open your cargo bay to allow me to board and transport our tools.”
Huh. Scientists are a really wacky bunch. “I read you Garret. Cargo bay is decompressed but please allow us a moment to get everything ready for transportation.”
“Will do, Lone Wolf. Over and out.”
I tapped on my suits left arm, activating the helmet. The black suits we had on were actually quite sophisticated. The entire suit was composed of carbon-fiber nanites with carbon-durasteel alloy providing hardened armor on the vital portions, very sturdy and strong. An oxygen reclaimer was located on the base of my neck and would provide around two days worth of air without any resupply before failing. The nanites of the suit stretched and remolded according to the suits settings.
It looked as if a black liquid climbed my head, encompassing everything. There was no faceplate, only a faceless black surface. A display turned on inside the helmet, showing me outside world. It was as though there wasn’t a quarter inch of carbon-fiber separating me from everything else. The camera feed was provided in real-time with basically no delay from the nanites of the suit.
The suit was one of the perks from being a retired Navy personnel. It was, mostly, bulletproof and the refractive coating helped with energy weapons. The black paint also helped with keeping a low profile in space. It had saved my life during the war. A heavy blaster round from a destroyer turret had ripped through the fuselage of my fighter.
I had ejected from the ship and cleared the wreckage of my fighter as fast as possible. It was a basic tactic that the Navy instructors had drilled into us. Just because the ship was trashed, didn’t mean the enemy knew. Sure enough, three more blaster rounds punched through my fighter seconds after I cleared. Several pieces of shrapnel bounced off my suit, but nothing punctured through the carbon.
After that, I had floated through space until the fight was over. I started broadcasting an emergency signal and was eventually picked up by a Navy shuttle. I loved the suit and was glad that the Navy had allowed me to keep it.
I went to the back of the ship and started sorting out the cargo. The gravity was still on in the cargo bay so I wasn’t worried about the cargo floating around. After I sorted everything out, I lowered the cargo bay doors. The man that was floating around the ship flew in, landing on the deck. The box didn’t land with him, hovering beside him instead.
Garret waved at me after coming in. “Hello mate. Everything ready for me to ship off then?”
I nodded. “Sure is. Everything lit up green is yours.”
“I’ll get to work than, much obliged. The payment has been made, but we would like to request that you stay docked for about twenty minutes so that we can confirm everything works.” 
“We can stay for that long, but any longer and we might not make it to our next delivery.”
“Alright. Don’t worry though, we’ll have you on your way in a jiffy.”
There was only three crates for the station. We now had only forty of our original sixty left. We’d had a full load before we were ambushed by the pirates. As Garret was unloading his crates, Sam’s voice came on over the comms. “Hey Tony, did you ask about the fuel?”
Crap. Garrett was in the middle of loading the second crate and I didn’t want to interrupt him. After it was strapped down, I hailed him on the comms. “Garret, is there any chance we could buy some fuel and extra supplies here? We’re running pretty low.”
Garret cocked his head before shaking. “Nope, sorry mate. We’re running pretty low ourselves. Actually, we’ve got a fuel deposit scheduled for next week. Fraid you’re going to have to go somewhere else for fuel.”
I sighed. “It’s fine Garrett. We have enough to go to a few more stops before we run completely out. Sorry to bother you.”
“No problem mate. Anyway, I gotta get this last crate and then you can be on your jolly way, alright?” 
“That’ll be great.”
I quickly ended up in the Pilot bubble again, watching Garret going into the station. I twiddled my thumbs and watched the twin suns circling around one another in the distance. The red and yellow flames of the two suns entangled with another, blending together in a spectacular show of stellar forces. Even though they were almost fifty million miles away, they looked close enough to touch.
While I was admiring the view, Garret called and told me that the equipment all worked fine. Signing off, I asked the station to release the clamps and then we were back off into the void of warpspace. Another four hours later and we were in the Voltrax system.
It was another GSOC company station that had requested a supply run. Mining stations usually had fabricators there and would use raw materials brought in to the miners to make anything they needed. The only exceptions to this were food, fuel, and electronics. Fabricators were good for making hull plating, but they weren’t so good at making circuits or data chips. Plastic was a very rare commodity in space after all.
All GSOC stations were built the same. Flying into the bay at the bottom of the station, we quickly unloaded our cargo. This time, I didn’t forget to ask for fuel. They subtracted the fuel cost from the payment from our shipment and we also paid for docking overnight. Going aboard the station, we split up. I asked around soon found a pretty nice room to stay in. I called Sam but he had already booked a different room.
We were going to play around at a Zero-G court, but the court was already booked that night for a boxing match. Sam said it was alright, since he was feeling pretty tired anyway. I went out to a restaurant and bought a simple cheeseburger and fries. While our ship had some supplies, the only thing we could use to heat up everything was a microwave. Our food was lacking, to say the least. Even the chicken I had before was a frozen meal. The only reason it even had bones was because it was wings.
After I ate, I went back to the room and passed out. The pirate attack had occured at ten in the morning and we had just arrived at the station at around six in the evening. It had been an exhausting day. 

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 3</h1>

“What did you say!!” Admiral Belthos yelled at the communications officer. The Admiral’s thin body shook with emotion as he awaited the officer’s response.”
The man he was yelling at quivered. “I’m sorry admiral but your brother, Squadron Commander Belthos, has passed away.”
Admiral Belthos sat down in his chair. One of the attendants approached him. “Admiral,” she said softly, “do you need anything?”
The Admiral sat there for a second before nodding. “Leave me. All of you, leave me.” The attendant nodded and retreated. She walked off the bridge, along with several officers and guards.
Admiral Belthos was grand name before the war, the genius war tactician of the Empire. The Empire had fallen, but his ambitions had not. After the United Federation’s fleets took the capital, and killed the Emperor, the war had been declared over. Belthos was not content with such an ending. Several factions had split off from his fleet in order to surrender, but those who had stayed with had disappeared into the deep.
He stared off into space, the twinkling stars displayed on the viewport of the Armoured Battleship The Kraken. Admiral Belthos had no idea what to do. His brother had been very close to him, even if he had been a little hot-headed. 
His brother had been on a robbery mission. He was supposed to rob cargo vessels as they traveled through the Veltrus system. His brother’s squadron of three Raven-Class Fighters should have been enough to handle such a task and the freight hauler would have docked with the cargo ships to transfer the cargo. It had been a necessary job since they were cut off from supplies. The only way to refuel and repair was to plunder cargo like pirates of old, along with supplies that several systems that were still loyal to the empire were providing. The robbery should have been easy, especially since they would have been inside the warp boundary, safe from Navy pursuit. Their fighters were agile and fast, able to escape far before the Navy would reach them. So why had his brother been killed?
The question haunted Admiral Belthos as he remembered his brother’s passion for flying and exploring space. Tears trickled down Belthos’ face as he recalled who his brother had been. After a few minutes, he recollected himself. It was not appropriate for the last Admiral of the Imperial Armada to be crying, even if his brother had passed away.
He called his attendants back in after recovering his composure. His voice echoed through the bridge, disturbingly calm after such horrifying news. “Communications officer. Please tell me of the exact manner in which my brother died.” His voice caught slightly on the word brother but his face remained deathly still.
The officer was nervous, but still relayed the information. “I received a report from the freight hauler that was assigned to Raven Squadron 6. It was posing as another merchant, which allowed it to observe the following report. They were attacking a cargo hauler named Lone Wolf with little success. The cargo hauler was alone and without escort which was why it was chosen.”
“The cargo hauler was being piloted by someone very experienced and was able to avoid being hit by plasma fire. They called on the Navy and they sent a Freedom-class Destroyer Centurion.”
Admiral Belthos slammed his fist into the arm of his chair. That’s what went wrong. The Freedom-class were the newest ships of the Federation. They were updated with more powerful tachyon drives, allowing them to jump further into the system than other ship. Their spies hadn’t warned them of a Freedom-Class Destroyer, causing them to be caught off guard.
The communication officer had paused after the Admiral let out his anger. He continued on though once the Admiral gestured at him. “The destroyer warped in less than five miles from the three fighters and launched EMP missiles. The three fighters were disabled and then brought onboard the vessel.”
Admiral Belthos stood up. “If he is captured, there is still hope. The Federation doesn’t use the death penalty often, so we should be able to rescue him.”
The communication officer shook his head. “One of our spies is located on the planet where they were dropping off the prisons. The fighter that your brother was piloting had an overload when the EMP hit. It opened the fighter’s cockpit, causing an explosive decompression event. The EMP shut down the ship’s oxygen reclaimer and your brother’s suit only had ten minutes of air. The Navy brought the fighters on-board twenty minutes after the EMP. By this time, your brother had died of asphyxiation.”
The Admiral let out a ragged breath. Dying in space because of no oxygen was every spacer’s nightmare. Imagining his brother ending up like that tore his heart to shreds. His tactical officer leaned over. “Sir, should we try to destroy the Centurion?
Admiral Belthos shook his head. “No. By doing that we risk leading the Federation back to us. We cannot let them find the shadow planets. We cannot risk it.” His hands were balled into fists, small droplets of blood dripping to the floor as his nails cut into his palm. “Officer, you said that the cargo hauler was called Lone Wolf?
The communications officer nodded. “Yes Sir.”
Admiral Belthos took a deep, shuddering breath before nodding. “Good. See if our spies can find this Lone Wolf and place a tracker on the ship when you do. Order a destroyer captain to attack the ship when it is in an unnoticeable location. Attacking a Federation Destroyer would attract too much attention, but wiping out a cargo hauler shouldn’t raise too many eyebrows.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 4</h1>

The next morning I woke up at eight and changed into some sweat pants and a t-shirt. The station had a wide open park in the middle of the station to keep the miners’ morale up. After I jogged around the park a couple times, I did some push-ups, sit-ups, burpees, and a few other exercises I had 
Once my exercise was finished, I called up Sam on the comm. Normally I used the comm unit integrated into my space suit but it was currently being cleaned. Instead, I used a headset that attached to my ear to make the call.
“Hey Sam, when do you want to head out?” I asked him after he picked up.
I heard Sam sigh. “Do you want to leave now? I’m ready if you want to.”
“Yeah. I would like to deliver our cargo as fast as possible so we can decide what to do next.”
“I hear ya. I’ll be at the ship in fifteen.”
“See you there.”
I went back to my hotel room and changed into my space suit. Following the signs, I made my way back to the ship. I boarded it and went to the cockpit, running through the pre-flight checklist. I was almost done when I heard Sam climbing into the copilot bubble.
“How far along are you Tony?”
“Almost done Sam. All the systems are running green. After I pay the docking fees we’re ready to go.”
“Alright then. I’ll do that for you if you want.”
“Please do.”
I waited for a little bit before Sam was finished. “Docking fees are paid and I’ve got a navigational plan for you pulled up.”
I nodded before realizing he couldn’t see me. “Alright. I checked the manifest and we’ve got two deliveries to do today. One of them is going to take a while to get to and we’ll need to use a designated to reach it.
“Hey now!” Sam’s indignant voice sounded throughout the ship. “Navigation is my thing! You can’t just be taking over my job.”
I chuckled. “Well, maybe you should have gotten here sooner.”
“I was in the middle of eating when you called me! You can’t blame me for that!”
I was in the middle of navigating out of the mining station and Sam’s yelling was getting distracting. “Don’t get so excited.”
“What do you mean excited?!
“Just stop yelling until we’re out of the station at least.”
“Fine.”
	We exited the station but out conversation didn’t start back up. Soon, we were once again on our way. This had been our way of life for the past two years since the war had ended. We would transport items from one system to another before staying the night at the last system we delivered to. 	
It wasn’t an exciting life, usually, but it was a good life. Transporting cargo was a dangerous task, so most of the buyers paid good money. The problem was that maintaining a spaceship and paying for fuel was expensive. So while we were paid a lot of money for our deliveries, most of the money was spent keeping us afloat. We were lucky if even ten percent of the money was profit.
For the next six days, we went through our routine. Nothing unusual happened, but there was still an invisible tension between us. Normally we would be picking up cargo on our stops and lining up buyers on other stations. Instead, we simply tried to empty our cargo hold so we could go to Veltrus.
On the sixth day, we finally delivered the last package. It was several crates of spacesuits for some asteroid miners. It was an express delivery we had picked up in the Veltrus system before all of the madness had set in.
“Hey Tony.” Sam called. “Anything else we need to do or can we go straight to Veltrus.”
“Nope.” I called back, “Go ahead and punch it in.” I had finally decided to trust Sam with the coordinates gain, much to his relief. We had already replaced the computer we had taken the hard drive from at one of our stops. Both the computer and the mineral scanner were delivered. 
“Alright!” We entered into warp space. Four hours later, we emerged in the Veltrus System. Veltrus was one of the special systems that had a habitable planet 131 million miles from Veltrus’ star, a white dwarf star. The star had very intense gravity, despite its smaller size. That was why the warp boundary was 450 million miles compared to the 420 million warp boundary around Earth.
Once we were in the system, I headed straight towards the nearest planet. It was Getrol, the gas giant of the system. Hydrogen siphoning operations were located there, taking the planet’s atmosphere in order to power their reactors. Surrounding the gas giant were multiple moons.
Our ship was heading straight for Lunar Station, where we had agreed to meet Anna. Sam contacted the station when we were thirty minutes out and requested docking for the next two days. After getting the approach vector, I piloted the ship into the station.
I stretched as I walked off the ship. Sam came up beside me as I cracked my back. “What do you want to do? Lunar Station is known for its tourism after all.”
I sighed. “Not sure. I think I’ll just walk around for a while. How about you?”
Sam smiled. “I’m going on a skitter. It’ll be fun to just fly around on the moon, a giant planet hanging over my head.” Skitters were one-person hovercrafts shaped like a small car. Pretty fun, if you enjoyed driving. I didn’t though. Reminded me too much of my own job back on the ship.
“Alright. I’ll see you later than.” I waved as I walked out of the docking bay. Right after I left the docking bay, brightly colored signs and shouting assaulted my vision. Lunar Station was a very popular trading hub and tourist destination. As a result, many businesses decided to set up shop on the station. I merged in with the bustling crowds, heading deeper into the station.
I stopped by a small restaurant and ordered a reuben. I watched the crowds walk by, chewing my sandwich and occasionally sipping my drink. Four years ago, this station would have looked quite different. 
Marines would have been posted at every corner, the people would be in a rush. Most of the shops would have been gone and the crowds would be nonexistent. Now though, the war had ended. The caution and fear from that time had already faded. How swiftly the masses forgot the war, especially when they hadn’t fought in it.
I shook my head. There was no need to get caught up in melancholy now. Why was I thinking about the war now of all times? Maybe it was the pirate attack. It was the first time I had been fired upon since I had retired from the Navy.
I paid for my sandwich and left the shop. No point in reminiscing pointless things. Right now, I needed a distraction. I looked around at the different advertisements on the holo-displays. Their bright pulsing characters gave me a headache after a while. Then one ad finally stood out. Compared to the neon oranges and reds, this one was a soft blue. 
It displayed a picture of an icy blue gas giant hanging in the middle of space. The holo changed, displaying information about an observation deck of the gas giant below. Hmm. Sounded interesting. Staring at a planet wasn’t super exciting, but there wasn’t anything else that was jumping out at me.
The observation deck was at the very top of the Lunar station and covered the entire floor. The second I walked in, I gasped. Hanging right above me was a bright blue jewel. Soft, icy light came from the ceiling and basked the entire floor. The gas giant Getrol was enormous, appearing to take up the entire night sky. The ceiling of the observation deck was transparent, allowing an unobstructed view of its luminous surface.
“Beautiful, isn’t it?” The voice whispered in my ear. I jumped, startled at the sudden noise. I turned and saw standing beside me was a short old man with gray hair. He waved his hands in front of him. “Sorry sonny, didn’t mean to scare you.” He stared up at Getrol. “I never get used to this view, even after thirty years.” He turned towards me and stuck out his hand. “Anyways, let me introduce myself. I’m Steven, the tour guide of the observation deck.”
I shook his hand. “I’m Tony. Just a cargo hauler that’s swinging by.”
Steven smiled. “Nice to see that we’re still a popular destination. Anyways, let me go ahead and give you the rundown of things you can do on the Observation Deck. This right here is called the Dome. Above us is armored glass, allowing you to see Getrol in all its glory. It’s mostly meant for relaxation and a few artists like to paint here occasionally. On the other side of that black wall over there is the Field, that’s where the attractions are. Pretty neat stuff if you ask me. Couple roller coaster rides, low-grav laser tag, grav gliding, and this Acrobatics Room.”
He scratched his head. “If you like the view of Getrol a lot, I recommend going to the Acrobatics Room. I know it sounds tedious but you’ll be surprised, I promise. Don’t mind me though. If you just want to stare, there are different lounge chairs set up around the Dome so you can watch.”
I nodded. “Thanks. For now I’ll just watch Getrol, but I might take a look at the other things you’re offering.”
Steven smiled. “That’s all I ask. Anyway, hope you have a good time.”
“I’m sure I will.” I went over to the chairs he pointed out, but I noticed something Steven conveniently forgot. There was a lock on the chair and a credit scanner to unlock it. Unless I paid twenty credits, the chair would remain folded in half, completely unusable. I shook my head and grinned. That sly old fox. I took out an inch by inch square of thin metal and swiped it over the credit scanner.
The chair slowly unfolded into a black leather chair. Sitting down, could feel its soft, gel cushions supporting my back. At least it was a nice chair. I activated the reclining mode and the chair slowly leaned backwards until my face was a little above the ground. The view of the planet really was amazing. The chair had a massage option as well so I went ahead and activated it. Ah. This was nice. Getting a relaxing massage while staring at the natural wonders of universe was truly a unique experience.
The tension in my shoulders slowly disappeared and I drifted off while staring at Getrol. I was brought back to Earth, erh, the Lunar Station, when a beep sounded. I was a little groggy but realized what was going on real quick when the chair raised itself up. The beep sounded again. I had paid for two hours in the chair and the time was up.
I got off the chair and stretched, feeling a lot better. My body was relaxed and a lot more limber than before. Even if that old man hadn’t mentioned the cost of the chairs, he still had great taste. After that massage, I think I’d like to try out that Acrobatics Room he had talked about. It was the one he recommended to me after all and he hadn’t steered me wrong yet.
At the far end of the Dome there was a large black wall. Embedded in the wall was an archway with a semi-transparent forcefield covered the entrance. Walking through, I was assaulted by the sound. That must be what the force field was for, to keep out the noise. I don’t think I could have gotten such a relaxing nap if it was this loud over there. Above me was armored glass, with Getrol suspended in space. The room was so huge, I could barely see the end. 
Dominating the room was the rollercoasters. There was the classic ones where you went hurtling down tracks, but there were a few interesting ones as well. One of them was a giant column with seats attached to it. You would sit with your back parallel to the ground, your face pointing upwards. Then you would be flung upwards at tremendous speeds straight at Getrol before being slowly let down. I knew all this because I saw one of the rides being launched right as I walked in.
Roller Coasters looked fun and all, but I was still looking for the Acrobatics Room Steven told me about. He’d been pretty vague about it, but since I enjoyed his last recommendation, it was still a priority for me. A blinking holo-sign caught my attention. It had a small map of the Observation Deck so I walked over and checked it out. When I approached it, the map became bigger, allowing me to see it better.
Right now I was at the entrance to the Attraction Center. In front of me was the Coaster Hall. To my left was the laser tag. On my right was the grav-gliding and the Acrobatics Room. Now that I finally knew where it was, I headed straight for it. It had a black wall surrounding it, just like the one separating the Coaster Hall and the Dome. It even had the same force field, which I promptly walked through.
	“Hello sir!  How can I help you today?” The cheerful voice called out to me the second I walked into the room. It was a pretty common office with a couple people sitting down in chairs.
I went over to the desk. “I heard from Steven that this Acrobatics Room is a pretty interesting place. What is it exactly?”
The attendant was all smiles. “Oh good, a first timer! Our main attraction is the skydiving experience where we reverse gravity for you. It can be frightening when it looks like your falling towards Getrol, but it is definitely something you won’t want to miss. If you’re afraid of heights though, it is not recommended.”
“In the gravity room, you can have fun messing around in zero gravity while bouncing off the walls. The gravity fluctuates inside the room, making it a challenge to navigate. Most people find it disorienting, but it can be a rush if you do it right.”
“Finally, there’s the obstacle course. It has a wide variety of obstacles that are all in different gravity. Don’t worry though, safety is our number one priority, so go ahead and have all the fun you want.”
Hmm. The skydiving sounded pretty fun. Maybe I’d give it a go? I decided to ask the most important question though. “How much would it be to do everything?” 
The attendant smiled. “It’s fifty credits per attraction, though you would be partnered with random groups if you did that. The skydiving and gravity rooms are available for rental through and you can use them by yourself but it would be two hundred credits for an hour, with an additional twenty credits per person.”

Dang. That was a lot of money for renting a room. “I think I’ll do one of everything, with a group though.”
“Alright.” The attendant swiped with her hand and tapped on the holo-display in front of her. “That will be one hundred and fifty credit please.” I swiped the credit scanner. “Alright sir, your activities will start shortly. If you would go join the people sitting down, the skydiving will start in three minutes.”
I nodded in acknowledgement before sitting down. Beside me was three teenagers. The teenager right next to me was bald and had a sleeping red dragon on his head. I blinked. The dragon had moved and let out a small puff of smoke before going back to sleep. Ah, it must be a digital tattoo. While I can’t say I approve, they are fantastic to look at.
The boy I was looking at grinned. “Like that that huh? Pretty cool right? You should see Veldraux when he’s awake though. Right now he’s on hibernation cycle.”
I blinked. “Your tattoo’s name is Veldraux?”
The teenager rolled his eyes. “No, of course not. The dragon on my tattoo is named Veldraux. Haven’t you heard of Digi-Pets? My pets name is Veldraux and I got the tattoo so he could get out more.”
Kids these days. Maybe it was time to move on to more comprehensible subjects. “Sounds neat. So kid, you ever been here before?”
He seemed offended. “My name isn’t kid, it’s Jacob. Also, I’m 19 by Earth years so I’m not exactly young, ya know.”
I held out my hand. “Sorry, didn’t mean to offend. My names Tony. Anyways, about the Acrobatics Room?”
Once I mentioned the Acrobatics Room, Jacob’s face immediately lit up and he forgot all about me calling him a kid. I guess it just went to show how much of a kid he really was. “This place is amazing! The gravity rooms are nice to just float in but that obstacle course is something else. Me and my buds usually come out here and just race around here. It’s a blast man, you made a good decision.”
“What about the skydiving?” I noticed he left it out and that was what I was doing first.
Before he could answer, one of his friends answered for him. “You wouldn’t catch Jacob dead in the skydiving. Freaks him out every time.”
“Aw come on Sebastian! We agreed to never talk about that again!” Jacob turned towards me. “Honestly, it’s not that bad. It’s just...well… It always feels as though your falling straight towards Getrol with nothing to stop you. It isn’t for everyone, that’s for sure.”
I nodded. “Yeah, I could see how that spooks some people out. Anything else that’s interesting though?”
Sebastian grinned. “Of course there is! You should try the rollercoasters. The Hurtler is amazing, though Jacob won’t get on it for the same reason.”
“Dude!” Jacob yelled. “That thing is launching you face first at Getrol. I swear, it’s like they wanted to give me a heart attack.
Sebastian rolled his eyes. “Yeah, whatever. There’s also the Intimidator and Asteroid Tumbler if you’re a thrill seeker. I would also recommend the grav-gliding. They give you these anti-grav wings and let you fly around, really neat if you like-”
Before Sebastian could finish his recommendations, the attendant interrupted him. “The next Skydiving group can go in now.”
Sebastian stood up. “Alright!” The group lined up behind a different attendant that had walked into the room. As we walked down the hallway, Sebastian continued to talk. “I grew up on Lunar Station, Jacob and Liam too.” He pointed to the tall black man in the back. The black man didn’t say anything, he just nodded. Guess he wasn’t much of a talker. “Every weekend we come up here and just chill out. This place never gets old.”
“Says you.” Jacob murmured sulkily.
“Oh cheer up.” Sebastian threw an arm around Jacob’s neck. “Don’t be upset just cause we’ll get to enjoy skydiving without you.”
Jacob shoved Sebastian away from him, causing Sebastian to stumble backwards into Liam. “That’s cause you don’t have to wait in the hall for half an hour,” Jacob complained.
Sebastian gave Liam an apologetic smile before giving Jacob a shrug. “Just play with your holowatch, look at some movies. By the time you finish watching some stupid cat videos, we’ll be done.” I chuckled. Cat videos. They were one of the only things that remained a constant in human civilization. 
We were lead through a door and into a fairly small room with a few chairs. Through the glass wall on the far side, I could see a large circular area shaped like a cylinder. It went upwards a good fifty feet, ending in the now typical glass ceiling.  Several holes pointed towards the floor from the walls and padding covered everything else.
The attendant waited until all five of us were in the room before talking. “The Skydiving Simulator is now ready for entry. Anyone that does not wish to participate may remain in this room and watch. If you wish to participate, please enter the simulator.”
A previously unseen door detached from the glass wall, allowing entry. “Before we begin, I’ll go ahead and explain what we will be doing in the next few moments. Everything here is perfectly safe. You will each be given harnesses and helmets to use for the skydiving experience. Gravity will be shut off after you’re equipped and checked. Your harnesses will then activate and you will begin your skydiving experience. If at any time you feel sick or want to stop, wave at me and we’ll shut your suits gravity off. Then we’ll escort you out of the room.”
Now, for some ground rules. There is to be no pushing, shoving, or bumping into each other. Flips are permitted, so long as no one is around you. Don’t try and stick anything into the air-shafts, they have vents over them to prevent you from doing so and you’ll be immediately expelled from the Observation Deck after doing so. Any questions?”
We all shook our heads. “Good. Now I’ll go ahead and bring out the harnesses.” There was a large closet tucked into the corner of the room. She walked over to it and pulled out a rack filled with suits, allowing us to start getting dressed. They were simple gravity harnesses that strapped onto the arms and legs, I didn’t have much of a problem fitting into them. There was also goggles to protect my eyes from the air pressure. They sat awkwardly on my face and I had to adjust them several times so I could see clearly.
The attendant came around and checked the straps on the grav harnesses. She tugged on a few of mine and nodded before moving on to Sebastian and Liam. After checking everyone’s harness, she turned to address us. “Alright everyone, you’re good to go. I’ll go to the other room and then we can start.”
She left the same way we came in. I saw Jacob sitting down in one of the chairs. When he saw me looking, he gave me a thumbs up. The attendant’s voice sounded out from the walls, must be a speaker somewhere. “The Skydiving Simulator will start in five seconds. Zero gravity is now activated.”
After she spoke, I could feel my body become weightless. Before I could float off, wind started coming from the top of the room. The wind pushed my body downwards, keeping me grounded. Then, the whole world flipped.
The gravity harness activated, causing up to become down. My body rose, or rather, it fell upwards. The sudden switch in gravity was disorienting to say the least. What was up was now down and I was currently falling straight towards the bright blue marble in the sky called Getrol.
I could hear someone screaming, probably Sebastian. My body had started to flip in mid-fall until I was spread eagle, my body parallel with the floor. My body started to slow down as the wind coming from the ceiling pushed against me. I was now hovering right above the gas giant, gravity pulling me towards it. It was definitely a unique experience.
Sebastian was floating a little bit aways from me on my right. He lowered his left leg and arm, causing his body to slide over next to me. “Isn’t this awesome!” Sebastian yelled over the sound of air rushing past us. The wind from the vents made conversation impossible unless you were right next to each other like we were.
“It’s certainly new to me!” I yelled back. I looked below me and saw Getrol, just hanging in space. I could see why Jacob had been frightened, but this was just too cool not to do.
Sebastian grinned, though it looked ridiculous since the wind caused his cheeks to flap around. “Watch this!” He yelled. He slid to the right of me and then stood upright, his feet pointed towards Getrol. 
He plummeted downwards towards the glass surface. Before he could reach it, Sebastian flung out his arms and rocketed back up towards me. He swung his arms forward as he shot up, causing his body to start flipping. He soon lost momentum and started falling again but he spread eagled, causing his fall to slow down before coming level with me. “Cool, right?!” He yelled.
I gave him a thumbs up. “Sure is!” I might have zero-g training, but it was from the military. The most they did was tell us how to get out of a spin and travel from point A to point B. Tricks and fancy maneuvers was reserved for the fighters and shuttles.
I tried doing the plummeting thing but I just ended up flipping end over end instead. I went back to spread eagle form in order to stop my out of control flips and ended up on my back. I cautiously turned my arms and successfully managed to right myself.
Sebastian sidled up beside me yelled some encouragement. “Don’t worry about it and just have fun man! Keep trying out different things until times up, no one’s judging!”
I nodded and started my arms around slightly, getting a feel for the movements. It was fun just moving around and enjoying myself. 
Liam, the silent black man, flew by me a couple times. It seemed he loved pushing off the edge of the walls and hurtling as fast as possible towards the other side, adjusting his height by angling his body. Sebastian kept doing different stunts, backflips being the least impressive amongst them.
I had finally been able to make a dive at Getrol when the gravity harnesses stopped working. Or rather, they were now set to a lower gravity setting. Since the harness wasn’t pushing against the airflow as hard, I was slowly floated downwards, back to the floor.
The gravity harness kept decreasing its gravity, allowing me to get closer to the floor. By the time I reached it, I was officially in zero gravity. I looked around and realized everyone else was on the ground too. Normal gravity was restored at the same time as the wind shut off. I was used to that part at least, landing with only a slight flex to my knees.
The attendant came in and helped us take off the gravity harnesses. After we were done, a different attendant came into the room. “This way please. I will escort you to the gravity room.”
We were lead to a giant sphere of a room. It was like a giant hamster ball with everything, once again, made of glass. This time we put on a forcefield projector that would create a positive magnetic field around us. A similar field was emitted from the glass walls.This meant that we would bounce off each other and the walls before touching them, sort of like playing bumper cars without the actual bumping part.
We were also given small air jets for our hands. There was a button on the tip of the thumb that would cause compressed air to flow from the nozzles on our palms. This gave us some form of propellant and direction when we couldn’t actually push off anything. Small generators would continuously draw in air and compress it, though constant use would deplete all the air.
The attendant gave us a rundown of the rules, then we were set free. It was pretty fun, though very disorienting. The middle of the room was zero-g but gravity would fluctuate everywhere else. For example, I passed through the middle of the gravity room and fell towards the ceilings. Then I was pulled towards the wall as I moved out of the gravity well before I was repelled from the wall. All of the gravity was pretty low, with only a slight tug in one direction, allowing you to break from it if you wished.
Jacob joined us this time, though I didn’t see much of the teenagers. I saw them flying at each other before their shields forced them apart, sending them flying all over the gravity room like pinballs. Seeing Liam’ large frame go bouncing around the room was absolutely hilarious, until he came hurtling right at me. He sent me in a dizzying flight through the room that left me feeling dizzy. Sebastian had his hands by his side, zooming around like a plane. I tried it too and loved it, kinda felt like I was in a fighter jet again.
Once again, I was just starting to get the hang of the gravity room when it ended. The attendant turned on gravity at .1g, causing us all to float towards the ground. Once we were settled, gravity returned back to its normal 1g.
The attendant helped us take off the forcefield projectors while another attendant appeared to escort us to the last stop. The obstacle course.
There was actually a group of six already there, though the last two were at the end of the course. It had monkey bars, rope ladders, moving platforms, rock walls, and a lot of other things as well. I couldn’t really describe all of them, but it definitely seemed like fun.
The attendant faced us. “Alright, now we can begin the last phase, the obstacle course! As you can see, the obstacle course is separated into two paths. We’ll have you separate into two teams before having you all race each other one at a time. The team with the lowest time wins! There are prizes if your time reaches a certain point so try your best!”
Great. Cheap carnival prizes. Oh well, it was just some fun after all. We all got into groups. Liam and Jacob went over to the right side of the obstacle course, leaving me to partner with Sebastian. “Are these the groups you choose?” The attendant asked.
I shrugged. “Looks like it.” I didn’t really care either way.
The attendant nodded. “In that case, then please decide who will go first from each group.”
Sebastian stepped forward. “Alright Jacob, now’s the time for you to eat your words!”
Jacob took a step forward as well. “I beat you last time and I’ll do it again!”
Sebastian rolled his eyes. “That’s just cause I tripped. You won’t beat me this time!”
The attendant sighed. “If the two members are chosen, please stand in front of the swinging columns.”
Sebastian and Jacob lined up on their sides of the course. In front of them were large foam columns swinging on chains attached to the ceiling. “The race will begin in three, two, one, start!”
They immediately took off, weaving through the columns. After getting through the columns, I could see them stumble slightly before they took off, climbing up the rock wall. Both of them were fairly even as they raced through the obstacle course. Sebastian was ahead by only a slight amount all the way until they reached a section of the course that was made of ice. Sebastian wobbled and waved his arms around as he tried to keep going. Jacob, on the other had, was shuffling down the icy path, keeping a decent pace up. Once they made it past that point, Jacob was in the lead by two feet. After three more obstacles, they were once again neck and neck. Finally, they finished.
I couldn’t see their times but it wasn’t that important. I turned to Liam. “You ready to go?”
“Hm.” Liam let out a grunt as he nodded before going to his side of the course. I guess he really didn’t like to talk. I took up my spot and nodded at the attendant.
The attendant nodded back before beginning the announcement. “If everyone is ready, the race can begin! In three, two, one, go!”
I started running down the course. A column swung right at my face. I stomped forward, slowing down enough to where it just missed me. Once it had passed, I continued running. After making it through the swinging columns, I continued down the obstacle course. I stumbled as gravity shifted, my body becoming heavier.
I recovered quickly and started scaling the rock wall. I’d forgotten that the obstacle course changed gravity, but I’d been through obstacle courses like this before in the Navy. Some of the obstacles here weren’t on the training course I’d been on, but the fluctuating gravity wasn’t new. It was basic training for all Navy personnel, plus it was a good work out.
I scaled the rock wall in no time and used the monkey bars at the top to swing to the other end. Gravity lightened halfway through, though it didn’t affect me too bad. I went through a couple more obstacle courses before reaching the ice slick. Instead of slowing down and cautiously walking over it, I slid baseball style over the ice. It was cold and my thigh was a little numb but it worked. I was on the other side of the icy floor. I picked myself off the ground and continued with the obstacle course.
When I reached the end of the obstacle course, Sebastian and Jacob were standing there. The second I was done, Sebastian started freaking out. “Dude, those were some slick moves! I’m definitely trying out that slide next time! Where’d you learn them from?!”
I waved him off. “Don’t worry about it. I learned them when I was in the military, though I’m retired now.”
“How long ago was that?” Sebastian asked, his curiosity radiating from his face.
“Sheesh.” I rubbed the back of my neck as I thought. “Well, I joined the military right out of highschool  when i was nineteen, so I guess it’s been eight years.”
“That can’t be right.” Jacob butted in. “Military contracts are for a minimum of ten years. There’s no way that you’re retired now if it was eight years ago.”
I glared at him. “If you would recall sonny, there was a war four years ago. Weren’t you aware that you could get out of military contracts so long as you saw action?”
Jacob noded, ignoring my harsh look. “Oh yeah. Sorry. I guess I forgot about that part.” He smiled at me. “That makes you a veteran right? So what kind of action did you see?”
I shrugged. “I was a fighter pilot. Only action I saw was when I’d attack other ships. I would see a ship, fire on it until it blew up, then leave. The story repeats a couple times and then I’m retired, not much else I can say.” More like, there wasn’t much else I wanted to say.
Sebastian nodded. “Pretty cool. My dad was a marine during the war, saw some action planetside. Still gives him nightmares. Thanks for your service Tony.”
I smiled. “Nice know that we’re still remembered. Thanks Sebastian.”
Liam exited he obstacle course right at that moment. Sebastian went over to him with the largest possible grin on his face. “Hey, Liam. How does coming in last place feel?”
Liam just let out a grunt in reply. 
An attendant had been standing off to the side while we chatted. Now that everyone was out, he decided now was the time to approach us. “Excuse me sirs, but now that your game is done, would you like to view your times?”
Sebastian grinned. “Sure thing.”
We were lead to a small holo-display. On the right side displayed in blue were two times. 5 minutes and 49 seconds was the first and 6 minutes and 32 seconds was the second. On the left in red was also two times with the first being 5 minutes and 48 seconds and second time was 5 minutes and 22 seconds.
Sebastian shook his head. “Beat by twenty six seconds. That really hurts my pride.” He turned towards Jacob. “You, on the other hand, have been beat. Admit it, the last time you won because I slipped on the ice.”
Jacob rolled his eyes. “Beating me by a second isn’t an accomplishment, it’s luck.”
Sebastian sighed. “What can I say, sore sports are everywhere.”
Interesting as it was, the obstacle course had worn me out. “Sebastian, Jacob, Liam, it’s been fun but I think I’m going home.
Jacob came over and held his hand out. “No problem man. Take care alright?”
I shook his hand. “Thanks, you take care of yourselves.”
Sebastian went over to Liam. “Say something man! Don’t make the poor guy feel left out.”
Liam sighed before looking at me. “Bye, Tony.
Sebastian grimaced. “Really? Is that all you can say?” He turned towards me. “Sorry about Liam, he just doesn’t like to talk. See you later, alright?”
I shook his hand. “Yeah, I’ll see you later.”
After saying our goodbyes, I left for my hotel room. It had been three hours since I last ate, so I wasn’t super hungry. I still grabbed a snack before crashing though. We’d arrived at the station a little after four, so it was a little early to be passing out. The Acrobatics Room had exhausted me though, so it wasn’t hard for me to fall asleep.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 5</h1>

The next day, I just hung out in the area. Today I was meeting Anna, so I wasn’t planning on doing anything until I met her. I watched a couple movies, caught up on a few shows I was watching. Before I knew it, it was time to meet Anna.
I went down to spot we were going to meet at a few minutes early. I didn’t have to wait for long before Anna showed up. She was in civilian clothes, in jeans with a t-shirt. She was definitely going for informal.
“Hey Victor.” She walked up me and held out her hand, wiggling her eyebrows at me as she did so.
 I chuckled before grinning at her and shook her hand. “Hi Anna. Remember, I go by Tony now.” 
Anna grinned coyly. “Fine, Tony” she stretched out the y in my voice to make it sound like a question. I just shook my head and ignored it. She chuckled. “So, do you have anything planned Tony?”
I nodded. “There was an interesting place I found, on the Observation Deck.”
“Ooh,” Anna exclaimed. “I haven’t been to the Observation Deck before.”
“Great. This should be good then.”
I led Anna to the Observation Deck and then tried to take her to the Acrobatics Room. Instead of going though, Anna forced me to rent a chair with her and talk, all while Getral hung above us. While we talked a little bit about what we’d done since the war, I saw Steven out of the corner of my eye. He waggled his eyebrows and smirked at me before wandering off. That dirty old man.
After about a half hour, we’d finished exchanging stories. The carrier we’d been assigned to had suffered massive damage during our last fight together, the one that had ended the war. Due to the shortage there hadn’t enough material to repair it, so Anna ended up being assigned to the Destroyer she was serving on currently.
As for me, I told her about our rough start as cargo haulers. I griped a little bit about how rough it was being a cargo hauler. There wasn’t a lot to do when hauling except watch movies, read, or play games. For most people, that might be a dream come true. Anna knew better though. I’d always been restless when we’d been in officer training together, wandering the halls and exploring rooms. Got me in quite a bit of trouble when I was enlisted.
	Once I got past the first two minutes of complaining, I started sharing with her the beauties of cargo hauling. Getting to see all sorts of different stellar systems, visiting exotic planets, hauling weird goods. The strangest thing I’d ever hauled had been socks. I mean, who needs three crates of socks? Apparently one station did after some stupid teenagers played a prank by flushing the laundry out through the airlock. Coincidentally, the laundry was mostly composed of socks, hence the rush order I had been happy to take.
I never took live cargo after one of my fabled incidents involving a group of pigs. The mess they made of the cargo bay hadn’t come out until we used industrial cleaner. It wasn’t worth the extra money for all that hassle. The story had Anna dying laughing though.
Once I finished my tale, we relaxed for while. If the time on our seats hadn’t ended, I don’t think we ever would have moved. Once we were forced to get up, I finally managed to take Anna to the Acrobatics room. After paying, we ended up going by ourselves. It was three in the afternoon, meaning most other people were at work or at school.
Anna loved the skydiving experience and the attendant let us stay a little longer than we were supposed to. The gravity room was interesting, but the obstacle course took the cake. Back in the officer’s academy, we had done basic training together. Anna usually scored better than me in the training due to her growing up on Earth. The higher gravity environment meant she had better muscle density than me.
When we made it to the obstacle course, Anna showed me what an Earther could really do. She made it through the course in 4 minutes and 38 seconds while I managed to cut my previous time down to 5 minutes and 1 second. Once we finished with the obstacle course, I took Anna out to eat.
I took her to the same little restaurant I had eaten at before. I ordered a horseshoe  this time. It was ground up hamburger meat covered in toast, fries, and melted pepper jack cheese. Delicious. Anna ordered country fried steak. While we were eating, we started talking again.
“So Tony,” Anna took a quick gulp of soda before continuing. “You ever thought of going back into the Navy?”
I shook my head since I was in the middle of chewing. I swallowed before speaking up. “Nope, not once.”
Anna looked disappointed. “You were a brilliant pilot. So long as you could get over your… issue. I believe you’d be so once again.”
I held up my hand. “No. I refuse to get into a fighter’s cockpit ever again.”
Anna sighed. “Those deaths weren’t your fault Tony. We had to take out those dreadnoughts, your squadron was just following orders.”
I looked out the window of the shop. “I know that. I really do. Still, I won’t do it. Just remembering those monster ships, the lives that I’ve taken… I still can’t sleep well at night.”
Anna grabbed my hand. “I know. I can’t sleep half the time either. The Navy needs you though, now more than ever. The Empire isn’t gone just because we killed the Emperor. There are still some officers that want to continue the war. Rumors have been going around that Admiral Belthos is leading the pirates.”
I turned towards Anna, my face grave. “I read about it in the news. How authentic are those rumors?”
Anna shook her head. “All too real. The pirates are too organized. The Federation believes that they are actually Imperial fleets acting under orders. That’s why they sent me out here, to find out if they really are Imperials. Those pirates that attacked you may be our first hint.”
“One pirate was killed due to a critical failure onboard, another committed suicide. The third one though, he’s pleading guilty on charges of piracy and we may be able to use truth serum on him. If the courts allow it, then we’ll know for sure if the Imperials are gathering again.”
I smiled. “Good to know I can still help the Navy in my own way.”
Anna gave me a sad smile. “Every little bit helps, even though you could do a lot more.”
“Enough, Anna.” I decided to stop the direction the conversation was going in. It was bringing up memories that I would have rather left behind amongst the smoldering wrecks.
Anna turned to look at my face. She studied me for a couple seconds before nodding.  “Fine. We’re supposed to be enjoying ourselves anyway. Now that we have the dark, depressing stuff out of the way, did I tell you that my brother finally graduated college?”
“What? No way. That little brat’s out of college?” Her brother had been this immature snot-box that visited every once in a while on holidays. I only got to see him three times but that was three times too many for me. He was always talking your ear off and never took the hint to stop, though he was pretty smart, I’ll give him that.
Anna nodded. “I know, I can hardly believe it either but it’s true! He got a job as an orbital engineer.”
The conversation finally turned to the lighter subject of our family. My mom and dad were still on the asteroid mine, living off their retirement funds and my military pension. I didn’t let them know it was me that provided the money though, I hid them as several different benefits for asteroid miners and had convinced them to apply for it. They were the only ones applicable for the benefits, letting me help them without their pride getting in the way.
By the time we finished the dessert, we were both tired. Anna yawned before turning towards me. “So Tony, how long are you going to be staying on Lunar Station?”
I sighed. “We’re setting off to the Sigma System tomorrow, so not long.” I gave her a lopsided smile, “We’ll see each other again though, I’m sure of it.”
Anna smiled back. “Yes, I’m sure we will.”
We left the restaurant after that and merely walked around the station admiring the view. After an hour of wandering, we finally separated. I called Sam and asked him to be ready to leave in twelve hours before going to bed.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 6</h1>

My sleep was restless. I wasn’t quite sure of what all I had dreamed, but I did remember waking up as a bolt of plasma burned me alive. It definitely wasn’t one of my best dreams, but not my worst by a long shot. 
Due to my semi-nightmare, I woke up over five hours before my alarm was set. I tried going back to sleep, but it just wasn’t happening. I ended up getting some breakfast and just chilling inside the hotel room watching some random reality show on the holo-display. Finally the alarm I had set last night went off. Turning it off, I took a shower before going down to the ship. 
I still had had about half an hour to kill despite the shower, so I decided to check the fuel and oxygen levels on-board. While the oxygen reclaimers were very efficient, we still needed to get fresh air every once in a while for them to work. If we didn’t, than we would eventually run out of breathable air and die, though it would take at least three months for that to happen. Still, it was something I needed to check up on every once in a while.
I had just finished making sure we didn’t need to restock the food when Sam finally arrived. He walked into the galley, his face showing some surprise. “Hey Tony, he said. “You’re here pretty early.” He walked over and grabbed a glass before filling it up with some water.
“I couldn’t sleep so I came over here. I already checked all the systems so you just have to get a course approved and we can head for the Sigma System,” I said.
Sam nodded before downing his glass with one gulp. He rinsed the cup out and put it back up in the cabinet. He looked at me for a couple seconds before he suddenly spoke up. “So Tony. Have you decided yet? You know, about the asteroid belt.” 
I gathered my thoughts before speaking. “I think we should mine it.” Sam gave me strange look. “What?” I asked, a little self-conscious.
Sam shook his head. “Nothing. I just thought you’d want to give it to the federation. I mean, you’re pretty gung-ho about the UF, so hearing you say that you want to keep it all to yourself seems out of character.”
I sighed.  “Well honestly, I would have probably given the asteroids to the UF if you had asked me two days ago. However, the talk with Anna changed my mind. The Federation is in a very dangerous position in right now and I’m afraid that his discovery could push them over the edge.”
Sam cocked his head at me. “What are you talking about? How could a discovery that would revitalize the economy possibly destroy the Federation? Just what did you talk with Anna about?”
“Well Sam, let me tell you how that could happen. Currently, the Empire is no more, at least they have no control over civilized systems. We killed the Emperor and dissolved their legal body. Their fleets dissolved into anarchy with some surrendering and others turning to piracy. The UF believes that Admiral Belthos is actually orchestrating all the pirates.” 
Sam gasped. “You mean the same Admiral Belthos that was the Emperor’s main strategist? How did he escape capture if we took their homeworld?”
I shook my head. “Unfortunately, Admiral Belthos was leading a different fleet than the Emperor’s defense fleet. He’s been on the run ever since the fight and has been working to rebuild the Empire. He is a very dangerous foe and the Federation is right to be wary of him. Anyways, I found out that the pirates supposedly number only a third of the United Federation’s fleets.
Sam looked puzzled. “If that’s true, why are we worried about Admiral Belthos? If they only have a third of our fleet, then we would crush them if we fought.”
I nodded. “That is true, but only in a situation where our fleets fight head on. Admiral Belthos wouldn’t be stupid enough to let that happen. The Federation believes that the pirate attacks are actually covert operations to resupply the fleet of Admiral Belthos. He’s been attacking convoys between core systems in order to try and get more resources, but since the Navy is beginning to get their act together on that he’s been getting more desperate. Just two days ago, they infiltrated a mining station and took all of its supplies.”
Sam looked shocked. “If they’re giving us that much trouble, we should just crush them. Make the UF stop playing around, get the fleet together, and be done with it.”
I sighed. “If only it was that easy Sam. We have no idea where Admiral Belthos is keeping his ships, or if they are even in one place. All attempts to track the pirates have failed and none that have been captured alive have talked. Most likely they’re at some secret military facility set-up by the Empire. It wouldn’t be that hard for the Empire to label some habitable systems into void systems.”
Sam nodded. “Yeah, I know we had a few bases like that ourselves.” He shook his head. “Hold up. We’re supposed to be talking about why we can’t give the asteroid belt to the UF. How does all this tie in to that. I mean, yeah, it is nice to know, but it doesn’t seem relevant.”
I nodded. “Yes, it doesn’t seem related at all. However, that is where you’re wrong. You see, when we won the war, we also took over the different systems that the Empire previously had under their control. Currently the UF has 838 systems that are inhabited by humans, whether they live on stations or on planetary bodies.”
“The UF has to protect all 838 systems and all the trade routes between them. Even if we outnumber Admiral Belthos’ fleet by three to one, that doesn’t mean squat if our fleets are spread out protecting that many systems. The Imperial Armada gathered by Admiral Belthos doesn’t have that problem though. They’ve already lost the war and only have to protect their fleets and any military bases they have. Belthos knows that and he’s using that advantage by consolidating his fleets. Under the guise of pirates he’s attacking poorly-guarded trade routes and systems, adopting guerilla tactics.”
Sam sighed. “I see. So where does that leave us?”
“Well, that is actually the easiest thing to explain.” I scratched my head as I tried to think of a way to say this clearly. “Sam, how do you think that Belthos knows what systems to attack and how strong the defenses are?”
Sam’s eyebrows scrunched as he thought over the question. I saw the light bulb moment when horror came across his face. “They have spies in the Federation.”
I nodded. “Bingo. If the Federation finds out about the large amount of minerals in that asteroid belt, so would Admiral Belthos. Our fleets are spread so thin that we couldn’t protect all our systems and that asteroid belt. We’d have to make a choice between protecting the citizens, or protecting our resources.”
Sam grimaced. “I wouldn’t want to make that choice.”
I shook my head. “No, neither would I. Belthos would attack whichever one wasn’t defended, using whatever he plundered to rebuild his fleet. If they manage to take all of the resources in that asteroid belt, we would be facing the fourth galactic war. We aren’t ready for such a devastating fight yet. It’s better if we just let sleeping dogs lie.”
Sam flopped into the chair at the table. “I see. That is definitely a valid reason for not wanting to give the asteroids to the Federation. But. You never gave a reason for wanting to mine it.”
I smiled. “Well, that part is a little selfish. Eventually the core systems will be locked down so hard that Admiral Belthos will turn to the fringe systems to get resources. When that happens, our section of space will start to get pretty dangerous thanks to his little pirate gang. With the money we’ll earn by mining the asteroids, we can buy a better ship. I don’t know about you, but I don’t feel secure in this hunk of rust we have for a ship at the moment.”
“Heh. “ Sam shook his head wryly. “I didn’t think the great hero of the Federation would admit to being selfish.
I shrugged. “It’s impossible to not be completely selfless. I’m still human after all. Anyway, aren’t we supposed to be getting ready to leave?”
“Yeah.” Sam sighed as he slowly got up. “Fine, I guess I’ll get the flight plan laid out and approved. Give me about ten minutes.
I nodded and finished taking stock of our food. By the time I was done, Sam was ready to take off. After getting the message, I went up to the pilot bubble and warmed up the engines. While I had done some preparation before hand, I hadn’t started the engines since that would have just wasted some very expensive fuel.
I pulled up the navigational path that Sam had gotten approved before taking off. We left the little moon that held lunar station behind as we set sail for the warp boundary. We entered warp space without a hitch. I went to my bedroom and took a nap, catching up on the sleep I had lost from my nightmare. I don’t know what Sam was doing, but luckily it didn’t disturb me.
It felt like I had just laid down when the alarm went off. I went up to the pilot bubble and turned on the HUD, preparing for our exit from warp space. When we dropped out an hour away from the planet, the proximity alarms went off. There were several small shuttles around where we had emerged from. They quickly avoided us and continued on their way towards the small planet not too far away. Most likely they were tourists or workers on their way back home.
The Sigma System was considerably larger than the fringe systems we had been delivering to. This was because Sigma was a core system, one that was under permanent protection of the Navy. Core systems had Navy Garrisons on them and there would often be patrols in the area as well. Fringe worlds were systems that had some Navy protection but did not have a permanent Navy Garrison, relying on Navy Outposts to provide some meager form of protection as UF ships patrolled the area.
The fringes were dangerous and unexplored, due to the fact that only the most basic of of surveys had been carried out for the fringe systems. Because of the danger that came with colonizing these systems, the Federation had a set of rules that greatly benefited colonies and mining operations.
These benefits included free land that could be claimed, extremely low taxes on imported and exported goods, and life insurance for all inhabitants of the fringe. Due to this, many colonists would attempt to eke out a life on the fringe systems and mining corporations would also set-up shop. As for me, the low import and export taxes meant we could make a decent amount of money, despite only having a single, small cargo ship.
I fired up the engines and laid a course for my house. After a half-hour,  we arrived. Notifying the spaceport of our arrival, I landed the ship at an open tarmac. We emerged from the ship into the fresh air of Bonth, the fifth planet from the sun that had been terraformed.
I called an automated taxi to bring both of us to my house. In a matter of minutes, the taxi pulled up in front of my house. It was a simple two bedroom house made of Insta-Concrete. Just because the house was pre-fabbed didn’t mean it wasn’t comfortable though.
I opened the door, coughing as the layer of dust on everything was stirred up by my arrival. Sam followed behind me, waving his hand in front of his face. “Man. When was the last time you were here Tony? This place looks abandoned.”
I smiled wryly. “Well, it was about two years ago. Anyway, let's get to work.” I turned on the lights and computer. The holographic user interface (HUI) appeared in front of me, the miniature projectors embedded in the walls and ceilings coming to life. The computer used facial recognition which was why it appeared in front of only me and not just Sam.
“Computer, give the person next to me temporary full access to the house and network.” There was a chime as my order was acknowledged. A similar HUI appeared in front of Sam. As I took a step forward the HUI disappeared. I sat down in the living room, waving away the dust that arose from the sofa. Sam plopped down beside me. When I stopped moving, the HUI appeared in front of us again.
Sam cracked his knuckles. “Alright, time to buy some mining rights. I’ll find us a good asteroid, just in case we actually want to mine sometime.” I’d already given him a price range so I wasn’t too worried that he’d go overboard.
I nodded. “I’ll leave it to you then. I’ll see if there is any mining equipment that we can buy. If possible, I want to get an ore hauler. They’re not super expensive and our ship only has limited cargo space. We’ll need the hauler if we’re going to be bringing anything back in large supplies.”
Sam shook his head. “Rather than an ore hauler, we should by a Exo-Container. They strap onto the outside of our ship and are a lot cheaper than a hauler. It’ll slow the ship down a lot, but I think it's worth it until we can buy a better ship.”
“I’ll look into it.” For the next couple hours we worked constantly to find something that met all the requirements we needed, an asteroid in a relatively unpopular or unpopulated area with a relatively good mineral content, and that also matched our price tag. Finding both of those was proving to be a very hard task. I had finished finding the equipment we needed after the first hour so I ended up helping Sam with his research.
By the third hour, we were both starving. I ordered take out from a chinese restaurant nearby, since the fridge and cabinets were empty. I had gotten rid of all my food since I’d known that I probably wasn’t coming back for a couple years. I was pretty grateful for that, since I didn’t need to get rid of rotting milk.
Five hours into it, Sam finally found an asteroid. It was in the Petral Mining System. The system was discovered five years ago, approximately 32 light years from the border versus the 7 light years that separated Delgatho from the border. It made it very easy for us to go from the asteroid system we discovered to the one we bought. The asteroid was all the way in the Oort cloud of Petral, far beyond what most mining corporations would be willing to spend. The asteroid was actually a dwarf planet that was on an elliptical orbit around the Binary Stars and was the only planet in the system. The rest of it was pieces of rock, most of which was silicate-based. Without the pressure of a planet, most of the asteroids didn’t have a very high metal content. Most asteroids with metal in them are debris left from planetary collisions. 
In this case, the twin Binary stars in the system  were unstable, resulting in gravity fluctuating. The unstable gravity disrupted an planetary formations except for the dwarf planet which escaped the unstable gravity by passing through the oort cloud. The dwarf planet had a very high metallic content causing it to be very valuable. If it was in an area that was more stable, it was possible that some mining corporation would have already snatched it up.
The only reason the mining corporations hadn’t bought the mining rights was because the planet would be unmineable during its time in the oort cloud. The dwarf planet would go through the oort cloud in four years and stay there for the next twenty. For the corporations, four years was a very short time to set up a mining operation and during that twenty year period, there were no other asteroids that they could mine in the system. At least, nothing that would warrant the effort to bring a team there.
Because of the lack of interest, the mining rights were very cheap. It was a difficult to mine planetoid in an abandoned system. Essentially, it was perfect. Once Sam found the Petral Mining system, he immediately showed it to me. We looked over the data and history before deciding to buy the mining rights. The mining rights would last for the next 25 years before expiring. Because it was cheaper than we had expected, I was able buy all the equipment we needed and I had some money to spare. My savings was feeling the hit, Sam’s too, but it was the price we had to pay. Besides, our investment would be paid back in full shortly once we started mining the asteroid belt.
The mining rights would now be included in our personal files, hopefully stemming off any questions as to where we got the ore once we started selling off the precious metals. As for the mining equipment, well, I had already told the seller we would pick them up within the week. The seller was on an asteroid in the system. Apparently he was getting ready to retire, so he was selling all of his mining equipment off. Thanks to that, we would have everything we would need to have successful mining business.
Since we had finished our planning, it was time to relax. I rented a couple holo-movies, ordered some popcorn and sat down on my couch. Sam sat with me and we both enjoyed watching the movie. I ended up passing out on the couch after watching the third one.
The next morning we lazed around the house for a while, playing some virtual games. It was a chance to have fun and just goof off. Having some friendly competition helped lighten the mood as well. Since we had decided what to do, I felt as though a weight had come off my chest. We had made plans and all we had to do was follow them through to the end. 
If everything went according to plan, then maybe I could finally live a simple life, just as I had always wanted. I didn’t like fighting or hauling cargo. I mean, I liked flying a spaceship, but not when it felt like a job. What I really wanted was a secluded cabin, preferably on a mountain slope, with a great view of a forest. A creek in the backyard with my wife and two kids. I didn’t want a life filled with adventure and glory. I had already been down that path and it was paved by death and destruction, far too much of it for me to carelessly lust after it. 

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 7</h1>

TWO MONTHS LATER

I felt the ground beneath my feet tremble as the autominer’s drill continuously dug deeper into the asteroid. If it hadn’t been for the adhesive on the bottom of my feet, I would have floated off into space. The asteroid was too small and its gravity too weak for it to affect me too much. It also didn’t have a large iron content, meaning that magnetic boots weren’t much help. The adhesive was a pain though, I had to reapply it every day or else I would float off into space.
	After ten minutes, the shaking stopped. Grinding sounds could be heard for a couple seconds before the shaking resumed. As it did so, a metal container as big as a shuttle emerged from the fifty-feet wide hole beside me. The metal container was attached to a magnetic conveyor belt, allowing it to move in microgravity without my assistance. It was pulled towards the Automated Sorting Equipment, its huge weight almost negligible. Several huge containers could be seen at the end of the machine as it sorted the materials the autominer dug out. As for me, well, I was in charge of monitoring the autominer, which I did using my holo-display to check its diagnostics, and to ensure the equipment was sent to the Sorter properly.
Sam was in the small tug that was currently coupling with a full container. The container was removed as another one took its place. The tug flew for a good distance before the container suddenly opened. The tug flew in the opposite direction as the container’s contents continued forward, their momentum causing them to fly into space.
The container had only contained scrap rock, the useless material that made up almost ninety percent of everything that we mined. As for the other ten percent, that depended on what we were mining. Right now it was platinum with a small amount of nickel. We had been mining this asteroid for past three weeks and it was almost done. The asteroid we were mining was only half a mile wide. Countless holes over fifty feet in diameter were already drilled throughout the asteroid with the autominer. Now that this asteroid was already turned into swiss cheese, it was time to move onto another one.
After an hour, the autominer had finished boring a hole straight through the side of the asteroid. Using my HUD to take control of the machine, I used its thrusters to fly it above the asteroid. I activated the mineral scanner in order to see if we should make another pass. The asteroid had a trace of platinum still, but not enough to make it worth the effort.
Time to move on to another asteroid I guess. I activated the comms to tell my partner in crime the news. “Hey Sam, the mineral scanner says the asteroid is done.” 
“Already? Well, alright. I say we go ahead and bring this haul back to the station. If we start on another asteroid we’ll only be able to mine for another five hours before all the containers are full anyways.”
I nodded, even though Sam couldn’t see it. “Will do.”
I fired anchor cables into the asteroid from the autominer. The cables were made of carbon fiber and the tips of the blades were made of crysteel. With the autominer anchored to the asteroid, we didn’t have to worry about it floating off. The autominer was a very large piece of equipment, too large to bring it with us every time we left. Because of that, we usually left it behind when we delivered our ore. 
Two months ago, we’d had a major headache trying to pick it up. The autominer was almost as big as our ship, making it impossible to fit into the cargo bay. Instead, we ended up strapping it to the outside of our ship. As a matter of fact, most of the mining equipment we chose was simply too big to fit in our ship. We had to make five trips before we could finally get all the equipment, such as the automated sorter and the cargo containers, along with the flex-conveyor. 
It took us two weeks to get everything set-up on the first asteroid. It would have taken longer if we hadn’t known what we were doing. Luckily, I had been raised on an asteroid mining colony to begin with so I had some experience running mining equipment. Of course, the equipment back then wasn’t so high-tech, but at least I knew the general idea behind everything.
Once we got everything set-up, we started mining. 3 days into it, we had filled up our containers and had to sell our load to the Delgatho Mining Station. It was close to the asteroid belt and to the fake mining operation we were supposed to have in Petral, making it perfect for a trade station. We’d already sold over five tons of platinum since the first asteroid we had chosen was mostly loaded with platinum.
With that money, we had bought the tug and several additional containers. Right now we were saving up for a better cargo ship and an armed ship. Security was our first priority and the very first thing we had bought was an escape pod. It had all sorts of high-tech equipment I could have only dreamed of as a fighter pilot.
The pod was armored, insulated, and lined with lead, making it impervious to most sensors and almost impossible to destroy. For movement, it had air thrusters ad regular thrusters. The air thrusters were slower but also allowed the escape pod to remain concealed from heat-detectors. The regular thrusters were faster though, giving it the boost in speed it might need to save our lives. There was, of course, life-support systems that would keep two people eating and breathing for three weeks. The most important, and expensive, equipment on the escape pod was the supercharged tachyon drive. 
The drive had an enormous energy source and range. Its warp boundary was only 200 million miles from the sun! Not only that, but its jump range was double that of our own! Compared to our 450 million warp boundary, it was a tremendous increase. Unfortunately, it was a one trick pony. The surge of power required to do that extreme of a jump would burn out the circuits in the tachyon drive. Regardless, the escape pod would allow us to instantly escape to a safe system if someone tried to attack us. With its stealthy nature and the powerful tachyon drive, such an escape pod was worth its weight in gold. 
I considered it to be our first priority when we went shopping and Sam couldn’t have agreed more. The reason I had agreed to mining the asteroids was so we could protect ourselves after all. Of course, getting rich had a part in it as well, but our survival was still the major deciding factor for me. 
Sam had already strapped the four containers to the outside of our ship already. I say strapped but that isn’t quite the right terminology. Rather than straps that wrap around the ship, it was a brace that was custom fitted to attach to our ship. By using the brace as an anchor point, we could attach cargo bigger than us to the outside of our ship. The brace could withstand the inertia of the cargo containers filled with several tons of metal because it was made of crysteel. 
Crysteel was very hard, surpassing even titanium in that regard, though it was a  good deal heavier. A scientist found that in zero gravity, the atomic structure of a certain steel-alloy formed the same structure as diamond. He patented the metal and made millions off the new material. It allowed for bigger buildings and more grand designs to be implemented, better spaceships too.
Now that the four containers were attached to the ship, it was time to go back to Delgatho. I had made my way to the opposite end of the asteroid, which was where Lone Wolf was at. Launching myself off the asteroid, I made a beeline for the ship. Currently the ship was turned sideways, the outer airlock facing me. It was floating only about twenty feet from me, so it wasn’t too far off. My hands gently impacted with the ship, flexing slightly to dissipate the kinetic energy from my jump.
Once I was stopped, I stretched out my hand and grabbed one of the handles on the outside of the ship, pulling myself towards the entrance for the airlock. Bracing myself against the ship, I used my HUD to open the airlock remotely. The red light on the outside of the ship flashed repeatedly and I could feel the vibration of the alarm.  I rolled my eyes. Too many safety precautions for my taste. Luckily sound didn’t carry in space, otherwise I would have started banging my head on the bulwark when the alarm went off.
Once the airlock vented all its air, the door unlocked. I climbed in and shut the door behind me. The hiss of air slowly became audible as the airlock pressurized. The red lights flickered before turning green. The inner airlock door unlocked and I entered the ship with slight push. 
Sam was in the hallway waiting. “Hey slowpoke. I can’t believe it took you that long just to walk to the other side of that asteroid.”
“That long? It was barely five minutes. How about you try walking half a mile in microgravity”
Sam sighed. “Why can’t you just laugh like a normal person?”
I chuckled. “I would if you’re jokes were actually funny.” I patted him on the back. 
“Come on, we need to drop our load off and come back. Do you want to stay at Delgatho tonight?”
Sam nodded, catching me by surprise. “Actually, yes. There’s a new movie coming out that I want to see. The movie theater at Delgatho should have it already, so I want to try make a night of it.”
I shrugged. “Well, I’m not opposed to it, so I guess we can stay. How about we go ahead and shove off now?”
“Fine with me,” Sam said in agreement.
I went up to the pilot bubble and strapped myself in. Activating the thrusters, the ship moved slowly away from the asteroid before moving into warpspace. A little over forty minutes later, we arrived at the mining station. Paying for the docking fees, I landed in the bay. It was late and I was tired from a long day mining. Unloading the cargo would have to wait until tomorrow.
I got out of the ship and stretched, checking the time as I did so. 5:32. I contacted Sam after finding a hotel room to find out if the movie he wanted to watch was playing. It was and he invited me to go watch it with him. Accepting the offer, I hitched up with him and bought lunch. We finished lunch around 6:20. With our stomachs full, it was time to watch the movie. On the way to the theater, some alarms went off on the station. The entire station went into lockdown for about ten minutes before it was declared all clear.
We ended up in a small clothing store while we waited for the lockdown to get over. Once it was finished, we made our way to the theater. Surprisingly, the theater was actually very comfortable, with cushioned seats, decent sound systems, and a personal holo-screen for every chair. I guess they had to make the entertainment centers for mining stations the best there are, otherwise they would have a revolt on their hands due to bored miners. As the saying goes, idle hands are the devil’s tool.
After the movie, I went straight to my room. I stared up at the ceiling for a little while before smiling. We had plenty of money, a stable income, and soon I would have a ship I could finally push to the limits. Things were looking up. I drifted off to sleep as I realized that my dreams of a relaxing retirement would become a reality.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 8</h1>

In one of the hotels on the mining station, a man was laying down on a couch. He was watching a sitcom, laughing his head off. His laughter suddenly cut off as a tone sounded from the computer system. Quickly making his way to the desk, he accessed the notification. His face became stern as he listened to the notification. Dressing himself, the man quickly left the room.
His true name was unnecessary, he didn’t even know it himself. For the moment he was going under the alias Robert Doss. He was a deathsworn, one the soldiers raised by the brainwashing facilities of the Empire. His duty was to carry out his mission, even if it required his death. He was trained by the special ops for covert operations behind enemy lines. One of his most successful missions had included infiltrating a Federation Military outpost and planting explosives on the base’s reactor. The resulting explosion disabled the outpost’s power and defense systems, letting the Empire’s armada take the base with no casualties.
The sitcom and the laughter was all an act, one carefully cultured for anyone that had access to his room. It was a dirty secret that cameras were installed throughout most stations, so he had to be careful. His face was registered with the UF database of criminals due to his missions during the war, so he’d taken extra precautions. Using his infiltration and hacking skills, he’d planted a worm into the control centers computer systems when he’d contacted them for a docking flight plan.
The digital worm monitored the center’s comms for keywords and also kept the system from recognizing his face. It was only thanks to the worm that he was able to stay on the station for the past few days. After he was dressed, Robert walked quickly down the hallway. Going to a restaurant across from docking bay, he waited for his prey. An excessively tall blonde man walked by the restaurant after fifteen minutes after he arrived. A much taller person, this time with dirty blonde hair, also left the docking bay shortly after. Robert waited for another forty minutes, slowly sipping his drink, in order to make sure they weren’t coming back. Once he confirmed their departure, it was time to carry out his mission.
Leaving the restaurant, Robert headed into the docking bay. Accessing the bay’s manifest, he quickly found the ship he wanted. Making his way to the end of the bay where the new arrivals had been stuck, he found an old hauler. On its gray exterior, painted in white, were the words Lone Wolf. 
He removed a small metal disk from his pocket. Attaching it to the ship’s nose, he continued walking as though nothing had happened. Walking around aimlessly, he admired several of the ships docked. Huge crates of ore were constantly being moved about through the crowded docking area. Everyone ignored him, too busy to care about someone beside themself. It was something he’d planned since the start.
It was 5:50 local time. The station closed its ore exchange at six, causing this to be the busiest time of all in the docks. If at all possible, he’d planned to be in the docks during the time and fate had worked out just right for him. While a crowd meant more eyes on him, it also meant more distractions for those eyes. To everyone else, he was just another face in the crowd.
Five minutes later, he received a notification. Making his way back through the crowded docks, Robert deftly extracted the metal disk from the nose of the ship, disguising his action as a loving stroke of the ships smooth metal hull. Now all he had to do was wander around the bay for a few more minutes before going back to the hotel. After a day or two he’d leave this god-forsaken station and go back to the Imperial armada.

***

The computer system for the Delgado Mining Station was very basic. It had a limited amount of memory to run its programming and store all the information it recorded from the station. To compensate for its low memory, the system would be reset on the first monday of every month at 6pm while all data logs would be transferred to a separate system. The reason for the 6pm reset was simply because of the logistics. Most miners were already docked by then, their ore in the middle of being unloaded and stored or sold to the ore exchange.
Just like every other time, the computer operator double checked that the data logs were transferred successfully before he started the reboot. At 6:03, the reboot was complete. Powering the system back on, the operator started to take a sip of the lukewarm coffee on the table next to him. Before the cup could reach his lips, the screens in front of him started to flash red and an alarm went off.
Startled, the operator spilt some of the coffee. Uttering some curses, he set down his coffee and clicked on the alarm to get the details. A view of a camera appeared in front of him. A red circle appeared around one man’s face and a list of crimes appeared on a separate screen. In large, bold print the word WANTED flashed periodically on the image.
The operator quickly scanned through the list of the man’s crimes. Not even a quarter of the way through, the operator’s face was turning pale. Opening up the comm system, the operator quickly called the station’s security. “We have an emergency. An ex-imperial soldier is on the station. The computers just recognized him. The man is wanted for multiple acts of terrorism and one act against humanity. This guy’s in the big leagues.”
There was indistinct murmuring from the other end of the line. “I think he was leaving a ship that just arrived, I can’t tell you what ship exactly since the system was just rebooting. I’ll go through the footage personally to determine what ship so you can get the bomb squad.” 

***

The head of station security closed the comm line. Accessing the computer system, he pulled up a profile of the man. The man was a confirmed lunatic, an imperial fanatic. He rubbed his temple before activating the high-alert. Every member of the security team was now authorized to stun any suspicious people. An alert was sent out with the man’s profile along with a warning not to engage in combat. They would try and keep him unaware of the fact they had discovered him.
The standby team was already dressed in heavy combat gear. Their armor plated vac-suits were all painted black, making them very menacing. The armor plating was reflective, making it effective against energy and projectile weapons. The squad was assembled in front of the podium in less than two minutes, their training evident in the time it took for them to be equipped and assembled.
The security head went over to the podium. Behind him a holo-projector displayed the current location of the fugitive, his profile, and his picture. “Alright men, we have a difficult job ahead of us. This man here is a known imperial fanatic with excellent hacking skills. He’s wanted for multiple acts of terrorism, cyber terrorism, espionage, and military acts against the federation. He has no known name, though we do have several different aliases from his past missions.”
He stared out into the group of officers. “This man is a deathsworn. We have to take him down before he spots us. If we don’t, then it is quite possible that he will set-off some deadman’s switch before he goes down. As of this moment, we can only assume that this man hacked into our computer systems with the expectation that our camera’s wouldn’t see him. Thanks to the system reboot, whatever hack he used is gone, so surprise should be on our side. Gentleman, be careful. We must succeed or the entire station could be destroyed. Good luck.” With that, the security head saluted the men in front of him.
All twenty of the officers saluted back, simultaneously yelling “SIR YES SIR!” The unit officer started handing out assignments even as the security head walked away. This could end up being a disaster. Hopefully, the agent had no idea they were coming.

***

Robert walked briskly out of the crowded docking bay. His mission was done, so all he had to do now was wait. He made his way through the streets before reaching the elevator. Some people were already boarding one, so he went ahead and joined them. Making sure that his floor was pressed, Robert waited patiently. Soon, he was on his way to his hotel. He reached his room without incident. Gathering his things that were strewn about, Robert packed them up in preparation for his leave. He turned on the TV back to the sitcom he’d been watching before.
Before he could sit down and enjoy it, an alarm went off. Turning on his wristcomp, he immediately panicked. He’d hacked into the hotels CCTV cameras and set-up a monitoring program. Those programs were letting him know that the hotel was surrounded by members of the stations security personnel. Taking a deep breath, Robert calmed himself.
Getting out his armored suit, Robert started to get outfitted. Scanners for the station made sure that no authorized personnel would bring weapons into the station, a very ell meaning security protocol. It was a part of the station’s network that was heavily encrypted, meaning it was very difficult to not be detected if he hacked it. Rather than waste precious time, Robert decided to only bring the non-lethal stunners that were allowed on the station along with an articulated vibrosword. While it wasn’t what he’d prefer to use, it wasn’t detectable by most station’s scanners, a fact he’d taken advantage of multiple times in his missions. His weapons were only really good for assassinations and stealth missions. In a straight up fight, he was severely disadvantaged. 
He gripped the small stun pistol in his left hand, the sword in his right. The men were right outside his door. Robert carefully watched the men prepare through the camera in the hallway. It was now. With a flick of his wrist, the sword unfolded into its original size as he slashed out with it, the sword humming to life as the fusion battery embedded in its handle powered on. The security personnel in the hallway barged into the room, their suits allowing them to easily destroy the flimsy wooden door.
The first person through the door started to look around for the suspect, ready to stun him instantly. What greeted him was the razor sharp edge of a humming sword as it vibrated over a thousand times per second. Like a hot knife through butter, the sword passed through the man’s helmet and skull. Robert kicked the dead man in the chest, causing the other people behind him to fall. Dashing forward, Robert took off down the hallway.
A few stun blasts went by him, the crackling electricity impacting the walls around him leaving scorch marks behind. One impacted his back, causing a mild burning sensation but Robert ignored it. Quickly leaving the hotel, Robert was soon in the middle of the street. The security personnel had already ordered the station into lockdown, causing everyone to already be off the street. Over twenty men surrounded him, apparently a precaution in case he escaped. 
Gritting his teeth, Robert ran forward in an attempt to break through. Infrared lasers ionized the air in a straight line before an arc of electricity followed the path, all of it occurring in less than two milliseconds. He ducked and weaved in order to throw off their aim, but there was too many people. Six stun bolts hit him at once, causing his suit to start to fail. It couldn’t shunt the electricity off fast enough. Multiple shots impacted him as he continued to run forward and the men started to become more accurate. His skin felt like it was on fire and some of his muscles were starting to twitch involuntarily as the electrical charge leaked through. Robert fired a few shots of his own from his stun pistol but it was useless. The suits on the guards deflected the shots with ease.
Robert still managed to get into swinging range, but by then it was too late. He could barely lift his hands. He collapsed onto the ground, his sword beneath his chest. A few more shots impacted him, causing his body to twitch. “Captain, I think we got him,” one of the men standing above him said. Robert’s mouth twitched upward involuntarily.
‘All hail the emperor’ Robert attempted to mouth through the burning pain. The generator on the sword hilt started to overload, the fusion battery going critical. It started to whine before it exploded. The explosion ripped through Robert’s suit, instantly killing him. Thanks to Robert covering the sword with his body, and their own armored suits, the security personnel around him only sustained minor injuries. The duffel bag that Robert had carried out was also destroyed in the explosion, causing any evidence of why he had been on the station to vanish.
The operator in charge of security went back through the footage that he had been given. Unfortunately, there must have been some sort virus because any footage containing Robert had been deleted. They were able to determine which ship his was by backtracking purchases and dock dates. Once they did that, the bomb squad swept the ship. Besides food, clothes, and some furniture, there was literally nothing on the ship that could threaten the station. The ship was summarily impounded and the bomb squad started doing random sweeps of the cargo bay, but nothing was found. Eventually, the threat was dismissed.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 9</h1>

When I woke up the next day, I made my way down to the docks, though there was a section of the street blocked off. There was a hole in the street, probably caused by a burst pipe or an accident of some sort. It was most likely the reason for the lockdown last night. Oh well, it had nothing to do with me.
Sam was already at the ship. He’d paid some men to unload the ore we had mined and was currently overseeing the operation. After it was transported to the ore exchange desk, I went ahead and finalized the transaction. The amount of ore I brought in wasn’t common for miners around here, but it wasn’t rare either. Many major mining corporations were present in the system, meaning that large loads of ore were brought in regularly from their operations. It was one of the major reason we had decided to sell our items here to begin with.
After our ore was sold, we headed back out to our mining operation. Taking control of the autominer, I untethered it from its dock. Quickly finding another asteroid that was rich in platinum, we started working. For the first hour, we simply moved equipment from one asteroid to the other. Once that was done, we started our operation back up. Everything was going great.

***

“The target is currently in a secluded section of space beyond the frontier. They have stayed at their current location for an hour, leading us to believe that it is a base of some sort. If we jump now, there is a ninety percent chance of them still being in the area.”
The captain waved his hand. “Thank you lieutenant, you’re dismissed.” His sensors officer saluted before returning to his seat in the command center. The captain leaned back in his chair and sighed. Now that no one else was in his quarters, he pulled up the message from Admiral Belthos.
“Captain Xander, I am sure you are aware by now that my brother has died. I am sending an agent to tag the unarmed cargo ship that directly led to his death. This tag will send you their location by uploading their coordinates constantly via QE comms. Your mission is to kill the crew of the ship without alerting the Navy to their deaths. Good luck captain”
Xander sighed again. He was the captain of a destroyer. It was overkill to send such a well armed vessel to take out a cargo ship when a frigate or even a corvette would have been much more suitable for such a demeaning task. Already they had been on this assignment for close to two months. Thankfully, the end was in sight. Pulling himself together, Captain Xander headed towards the bridge.
As he walked through the automatic doors, his aide announced him. “Captain on deck.” Everyone stood up and saluted him. 
“At ease.” As everyone sat back down, he sat down in his own chair. “Navigation, punch in coordinates for the very edge of the system that our targets are in currently. We need to scout out the system before we jump in blindly.” Just because the cargo ship was unarmed, didn’t mean that there wouldn’t be other ships near them that weren’t. He had never underestimated his foes before and he wasn’t planning to start now.
“Yes sir.” The navigations officer started preparing for jump. “We’ll be at our destination in three hours captain.”
“Very good. Make the announcement to the crew, tell them to be at their combat stations ten minutes before exit. Until then they are to eat and catch up on sleep if needed.”
“Yes sir.”

***

The captain stared at the projection of the system. “Navigation, is this projection accurate?”
“Yes captain. This is what our passive scanners have detected so far. We could switch to active scanning but I’m afraid that might alert our prey of our arrival.”
Captain Xander nodded. “Finding an asteroid belt out here is a blessing. With this, we might be able to help alleviate the lack of resources we’re dealing with right now. Where are our prey right now?”
The sensors officer tapped on his console and a red dot appeared on the projection. “The tracker has placed them here, on the outskirts of the asteroid belt. Based upon their location, I believe they are currently mining one of the asteroids. We’ve detected no other ships in the area except what appears to be two tugs.”
“Good. With this remote location, they won’t be expecting an attack. We’ll warp in next to the ship and commence our attack. Tell the crew, we’ll be there in two minutes.”

***
 
Sam was in the middle of dumping out the rock in one of the containers when he opened up the comms. “Hey Tony, you wanna get something to eat? We’ve been at this for four hours already.”
I glanced around at the mining operation. Everything was going pretty smooth, nothing that required my attention at least. “Sure, just let me shut down everything on my side.”
“Alright.” It was pretty easy for me to do the shutdown. Pressing the large red button on my tablet, the autominer stopped. I proceeded to shut down the conveyor and sorter before making my way to the ship. Sam was already there, making a roast beef sandwich. 
“Think fast!” He tossed the package of roast beef at me, catching me by surprise. I lifted my hand to catch it out of reflex but it hit the tip of my finger and fell to the floor. “Ah Tony! You just ruined the beef!” Sam had a grieving look on his face as looked mournfully at the roast beef laying on the floor.
I chuckled. “Oh knock it off you. It’s still good, only the packaging hit the floor.” I picked it up off the floor. “See?”
Sam shrugged. “Well, the fact remains that you can’t catch.” he opened the fridge and started to put the cheese back.
“Haha, very fu-”
ERRRR ERRRR ERRRR
The proximity alarm started ringing and the navigational shields flared to life around the ship. An image from outside the ship immediately popped up in front of me, part of the safety protocols of the ship. A destroyer had just exited from warp space beside use, less than five hundred yards to the right of us. The large plasma turrets swiveled as they locked in on us. I immediately accessed remote controls and activated a preset flight path, one that I had prepared out of habit from my Navy days. I thought it might come in handy if an asteroid was heading for us, not a destroyer.
All of the starboard (right) side thrusters, the thrusters on the underbelly of the ship, and the main engine all fired at once. These forces sent our ship into a corkscrew, disrupting any attempts to fire at us.
The intense thrust overpowered the inertia dampeners, sending things around the kitchen flying, including me. I crashed into Sam, my shoulder bouncing off his chest. I’d expected the change at least so I was somewhat prepared. Sam, on the other hand, wasn’t so lucky. His arm smashed into the fridge, the door slamming shut on it. I heard an audible crack and Sam started screaming.
As the dampeners kicked back on, we slid to floor. Sam clutched at his arm, his screams now whimpers. I scrambled to my feet. “There’s a destroyer outside. My little stunt is going to keep us from being blown to bits for a minute, tops, then we’re dead. They have a tachyon disrupter so we can’t jump. We need to get in the escape pod now.”
I’d already tried to activate the tachyon drive but they were sending pulses of tachyonic energy from the destroyer. The pulses interrupted the flow of warp space so that ships couldn’t jump. It was a common tactic during the war and some of the pirates had the capability as well. The escape pod should be able to jump despite the pulses though, thanks to its supercharged tachyon drive. If we could get far enough away, we would be able to jump as well. It wasn’t going to happen though, not in this ship. Now wasn’t the time to be thinking idle thoughts though. We needed to get out of here and fast.
Sam nodded, a small whimper escaping his lips as he tried to talk. I grabbed his uninjured arm and hauled him to his feet. “Let’s move Sam!” I started running as Sam followed behind me. Running through the corridor, I threw open the cargo bay. Sitting inside was the escape pod. I punched in the code, causing the three feet thick door to swing open. I climbed in, helping Sam get in afterwards. It was cramped, barely enough room to sit in the chairs. 
Upon sitting down, straps automatically locked me in place. I activated the pods emergency mode. The door shut, locking us in. Green liquid slowly filled the cabin. Because inertia dampeners consumed a lot of power, it would be impossible to remain cloaked if the escape pod was equipped with them. Instead, impact gel would absorb the kinetic energy from our flight so we didn’t end up as smears on the wall. The headrest from the seat wrapped around my face, activating helmet mode. With it, I would be able to breathe in the thick liquid.
I pulled up a view of the outside of the ship. The destroyer’s ballistic cannon was tracking us. I could see it finally pointing directly at us. I opened the cargo bay doors, overriding the safety precautions since the cargo bay was still pressurized. Random crates of supplies along with the escape pod started to fly towards the door when the entire ship exploded.

***

The weapons officer turned towards Captan Xander, announcing in a loud voice the good news. “Direct hit sir. The heavy cannon fired a ballistic round through the pilot bubble of the cargo ship. The entire vessel has shattered into multiple fragments that are now scattering throughout the asteroid belt.”
The captain nodded. “Thank you weapons. Sensors, can you get a read of all the fragments?”
The sensors officer shook his head. “While we are tracking some of the fragments, there were too many for our computers to identify. Most of the ship’s wreckage has blended in with the asteroid belt.”
The captain sighed. “Alright. Send a boarding party to the asteroid they were mining, make sure none of the crew is there. If they find anyone, their orders are to kill on site and drag their bodies back here. Whoever was on that ship is either dead already or they’ll die soon due to oxygen deprivation.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 10</h1>

The destroyer hadn’t moved ever since our ship was blown up. A couple shuttles had left for the asteroid we’d been mining, probably to sweep the area. Thankfully I had opened the cargo bay doors, allowing the escape pod to leave the area quickly. We were lucky that they had used a non-explosive ballistic round as well. There were too many fragments for them to conceivably attempt to track. 
Currently, I was using the passive scanners to navigate. Using the air thrusters, I managed to steer the pod behind a five mile wide asteroid. Activating the tachyon drive, I set the coordinates for the Sigma System. It was barely in range of the tachyon drive and it would take over ten hours to get there. However, we would be safe.
I activated the drainage system to get rid of the impact gel. We didn’t need it anymore since we were in warp space. Once the gel was completely gone, I unbuckled my seat restraints before opening one of the locked drawers that had the first aid kit. I took out a pain patch and applied it to Sam’s shoulder. He let out a sigh of relief as the drugs started to kick in.
“You feeling better?” I asked.
Sam rubbed his shoulder, making the pain patch stick better. “This really sucks, you know that? My arm is broken, our mining operation gone, and not only that, but our ship is destroyed too.”
I sighed. “I know Sam, I know. There’s not much we can really do now though. We’re heading towards Sigma right now. Once we’re there, we can start planning what to do now.”
“Planning what to do?” Sam had an exasperated look on his face. “Our little secret is out, I don’t know how, but it is. We’re currently considered dead by whoever attacked our ship and we no longer have an asteroid field to mine.” 
By now I’d gotten the insta-cast kit out. I put the metal bar alongside his arm before using the cast spray. The foam was sticky and malleable, though it would harden quickly once exposed to air. I continued talking as I applied it around Sam’s arm. “Fine, I admit it’s not an ideal situation but it’s not as bad as it seems. We’ve got plenty of money to buy a new ship, even one that’s armed. I say we get a cloaked ship and see if anyone is hanging around the system. If they are, we track them to find out who attacked us. Depending on who it is, we decide our plan of action.”
Sam shook his head. “I don’t know. This plan is a bit risky. We barely made it out of there last time, now you want to go right back in?”
“Hey. We’ve just barely started mining that asteroid belt. Are we really going to give up such a valuable find? Not only that, but I wanna shove a missile down the throat of whoever shot at us.”
Sam chucked. “Fine, I can live with that. Or die with it too. It really just depends on who it was that shot us up.”
I nodded. “That’s the million credit question right there, who’s shooting at us.”
Sam leaned back in his chair. The cast was now hardened, though it looked awful with lumps and bubbles throughout the hardened foam. “My money is on pirates. I can’t imagine anyone else, though I do want to know how they tracked us.”
I shrugged. “No idea, though we better pray that they aren’t a part of the Empire. I don’t want to be the cause of another war.”

***

“WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEY GOT AWAY??!!!” Captain Xander’s voice thundered throughout the command deck causing the bridge staff to wince.
The Sensors officer was shaking in fear, his words stammered and hesitant. “W-we believe *gulp* believe s-so. The scanners p-picked up a b-burst of tachyon p-particles, m-meaning that someone e-escaped to warp s-space.”
Captain Xander’s face was red with rage. He closed his eyes and took deep breaths, the red slowly draining away. Finally, he opened his eyes. “I’m sorry for the outburst officers. This is a mission from Admiral Belthos, one to avenge his younger brother. A mission that we have just failed.”
There was a collective gasp from the officers. Their mission had been top secret and only the captain knew what it was. To find out it was from Admiral Belthos, the leader of the Empire, was shocking to say the least. To fail a mission from the Admiral was something no soldier would want.
Captain Xander sighed before sinking into his chair. “Do we know how they escaped?”
The sensors officer was still nervous bet he’d visibly calmed down. “We still don’t know sir. Our best guess is that they may have had more than one mining operation or at the very least another ship in the area. We can’t find anything to back up our claim though and our sensors aren’t detecting any other mining equipment in the nearby vicinity of their jump.”
The captain waved his hand. “Fine. So we’ve ambushed the cargo hauler, captured a mining base, and we have no proof that anyone got away except the burst of tachyon particles. Is that all?”
The sensors officer nodded.“Yes sir.”
The captain sighed. “Is there anything else that someone would like to tell me about?”
The communications officer approached him, throwing out a salute as he did. “Sir, the boarding party has requested to talk to you. Their commander says it’s urgent.”
“Patch him through.” The captain waited as the line connected. “What is it commander?”
The commander saluted. “Captain, we have discovered a significant find for the empire. There is a mineral scanner at the mining base sir. The scan we’ve read off it though is unbelievable.”
Captain Xander nodded. “Send a copy of it to the sensors station for us to look over. Seize all equipment you can and return back to the ship.”
The commander shook his head. “With respect captain, I would like for you to hold off on that order until you can review the scan. This will change everything, Sir.”
“I will take your advice under consideration, you have your orders commander, carry them out.”
The commande saluted and closed his comms. Captain Xander turned towards the sensor officer, who was still standing in front of him like a frightened sheep. “Lieutenant, you heard the commander. Study those scans and give me a report.”
The sensor officer saluted and left. It hadn’t even been a minute whenever the lieutenant rushed over to him. “Captain, the Commander was right. Sir you need to check this out.” He glanced around at the other officers. “Actually Captain, can we go to a more secure area before I share this information with you?”
The captain nodded and retired to his cabin. Once there he turned towards the sensors officer. “Show me the scan lieutenant.”
The lieutenant nodded before bringing up the holographic report. Upon seeing the numbers, the captain turned rigid with shock. He stared at it for a few seconds before turning to the lieutenant. “Call the commander, tell him to halt operations. Take the mineral scanner and start sweeping the system. We need a complete scan before I can tell Admiral Belthos of this.”
The sensors officer saluted and left, the door swishing shut behind him. The captain sighed as he rested on the chair underneath him. This had been a rollercoaster of a day with many ups and downs already. Well, now wasn’t the time to be resting.

Admiral Belthos was standing in front of a star map, his eyebrows furrowed in concentration. Seventeen systems were lit up in green and two blue spots marked the map. Almost a hundred dark purple spots were spread out across the map and the rest of it was covered in red. 
The blue spots were the shadow planets of the empire, planets that had been marked as useless and then converted into fortresses. They were meant to be used as secret military facilities in times of war. Currently, Admiral Belthos was using them as refueling and repair stations. One of the shadow planets even had a mobile shipyard in orbit, the last one still intact, which he was using to build his fleet back up.
The green systems were systems that were sympathetic to the empire’s cause and was currently providing him with supplies. He didn’t trust them though. To prevent any betrayal, he had his men pick up the supplies in deep space at one of the purple spots on the map. His fleet was scattered throughout those purple spots into different squads, their quantum communicators providing constant coordinates to keep his map up to date. 
As for the red, well, that was Federation territory. Some of the purple spots were in the red, meaning that they were raiding parties currently disguised as pirates. A number of his officers had suggested that disguising his ships as a rabble of pirates was wasting time. The Federation already suspected that the pirates were the Empire, so it didn’t seem necessary to keep trying to disguise themselves anymore.
Belthos disagreed. If the public knew that the Empire was attacking and raiding merchant shipments and colonies, there would be panic. An outcry would cause the Federation to finally get their budget for new military ships passed through the senate. The fact that the Federation couldn’t take out what should be a rabble of pirates also caused the public to call the military officials as lazy runabouts that didn’t do their job. It was causing many high-ranked officers to resign, some of them veterans from the war against the Empire. To him, those gains were more valuable than announcing to the whole galaxy that the Empire wasn’t destroyed.
That decision was starting to hurt him though. Five systems had decided to stop supporting him. They weren’t outright hostile, but they had increased the price of many different goods, such as food and minerals, that he needed to keep his fleet going. Two of them had stopped sending supplies completely. That left only ten systems that were actually helping him.
If things didn’t turn around soon, he would have to reveal himself to the Federation. While it would provide a boost to incoming supplies, it would mean that he would have to go head to head with the Federation. If he didn’t then the Empire would appear weak, making it the exact opposite of what he wanted. He needed to continue with his guerilla warfare tactics he had used up until now, something that wouldn’t be possible with due to political pressure.
While he was in the middle of solving this conundrum, his aide walked in. He turned towards the aide. “This had better be important. I asked to not be disturbed while in my planning sessions.”
The aide gulped before nodding quickly. “Yes sir. Captain Xander just opened communications. He said that he has a very important message to relay.”
Admiral Belthos had a blank look on his face for second before he remembered who he was. It was the captain that he had ordered to kill the ones responsible for his brother’s death. Three months had gone by since he’d ordered his command staff to kill the hauler. Intermittent reports from their attempts at tracking down the cargo hauler had proven fruitful, since they had finally narrowed it down to the Delgatho Mining Station.
Recently he’d dispatched a deathsworn to the station, though it appeared as though the deathsworn had died yesterday. That report had made him worried that the deathsworn hadn’t carried out his mission. Maybe this message would prove otherwise. He dismissed the aide before connecting with Captain Xander. “What is this message Captain Xander? Perhaps a message that those who murdered my brother are now dead?”
Captain Xander grimaced. “That is a possibility, sir, but I suspect that at least one of them got away.”
Admiral Belthos lifted an eyebrow. “Explain that riddle for me, Captain.”
Captain Xander proceeded to describe the events that had occured within the last three hours. Once he got to the part of the tachyon particle burst Admiral Belthos was furious. Seeing that, Captain Xander quickly tried to calm him. “Sir, I know I have failed you in this regard, but please give me chance. There is something you must know regarding this system. It has an asteroid belt that is class 10.”
The redness that had creeped into his face drained away as shock came over him. “Class 10! You mean the mineral density has reached that much!”
Captain Xander nodded. “Yes sir. In a thousand mile radius over thirty thousand tonnes of precious metals were found in the asteroid belt.”
Admiral Belthos processed this fact at lightning speed. This could change the entire force of the war! Not that it was truly a war, but still, this could change everything. “You said that someone escaped?”
“Yes sir. The tachyon particle burst means that someone managed to leave the system.”
Admiral Belthos chuckled. Well, he finally had a reason to use all of his resources to kill those murderers. “Good. Send out a high-priority order. Anyone that sees the crew members of the cargo ship Lone Wolf are to immediately execute them.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 11</h1>

The escape pod appeared in the Sigma System fairly close to the planet with my house on it. I activated the emergency beacon and waited until someone could pick us up. After about ten minutes, a shuttle that was on its way to the planet stopped by. Using our space suits, we boarded the shuttle through the airlock. Unfortunately, the shuttle landed at a city over five hundred miles from my house. We paid for travel back to my house, but the taxi would take a little more than ten hours. Sam slept the whole way while I managed to get a nap in here and there. Most of what I was doing while we traveled was research for buying a cloaked ship and the prices of getting a new mining operation going.
Just like I had expected, the prices were enormous. We had made a lot of money from mining but it would take half that to buy the cloaked ship, six hundred thousand credits to be exact. About three hundred thousand credits would be needed to buy all the gear we had previously set up. That left us with a substantial amount of money though, a little over a three hundred thousand credits. Still, it wasn’t what I would have liked. If we had mined for just three more months, our credits would have tripled and retirement wouldn’t have been a pipe dream.
Shortly after we reached our house, there came a knock on the door. When I opened it, there was a sheriff on my front porch. “Hello. Is Tony Delgado home?”
I nodded as I said, “I’m Tony Delgado. You’re here because?”
The sheriff nodded. “There’s no need to be alarmed. We were made aware of the fact that you were picked up by a shuttle transit vehicle. Apparently you were in an escape pod? It’s standard procedure for us to gather details on this abnormal entry to the Sigma System.”
Oh great, an investigation. Time to make up some bull crap. “Well we were mining at our claim in the Petral Mining System when some pirate vessels attacked us. Our ship’s tachyon drive wasn’t powered up at the time allowing them to catch us off guard during our lunch break. We’d previously purchased an escape pod which we then used to jump here.”
The sheriff had a holographic display off to the side that turned what I said into writing. Speech-to-text apps had been a real lifesaver during school. “I’ll go ahead and put your statement into the report and turn it into the Federation. Be careful going back out to your claim though, I’m not sure if the Federation will be able to send a patrol to such a small system, especially since it’s not inhabited.”
“Thank you sheriff, is that all?”
“Actually, I’m supposed to ask if you want your escape pod back. You can’t leave it in orbit, so we’ve retrieved it and put it in the impound for you. We understand your circumstances so you won’t be charged with neglect for orbital vehicles but we will have to charge you five hundred credits for the retrieval. Until you pay, we are obligated to keep your pod impounded. If you would like, you could pay another hundred credits for us to deliver the escape pod to your house.”
I ground my teeth a little before thanking the sheriff. If I had known about all these fees than I would have just piloted the pod down myself! I knew, rationally, that it would have been a bad idea. The limited navigation meant that we could have ended up in the middle of nowhere. Staying up in orbit had been the safer idea. Still, those fees just rubbed me wrong. I promised him I’d stop by the sheriff’s office tomorrow to pay for everything. Going inside, I crashed on my bed. Sam was well rested after his sleep in the car, so he was watching something on the holo. Something loud. And annoying. Gah!

***

At one of the many offices dedicated to the Federation’s office, a man worked at a desk. Multiple search engines were running as he went through the mountains of paperwork his job required he file. As he was going about his job one of the search engines registered a hit. He wearily opened up the separate tab as he opened up the file beside him, ready to put the information in.
When he saw what search engine had pinged him, his eyes widened in shock. Glancing around the office, the man made sure that no one could see his screen. Seeing no one around, the man wrote the information down on a sticky note before tucking it into his shoes. The rest of the day the man anxiously waited until he was finally off work.
He clocked out five hours later and hurried home. Once there, he dialed a number and waited anxiously. It felt like hours until someone picked up, though it was only half a minute.
“This is Taxonomy Incorporated, how may I help you?”
The man took a deep breath to calm himself before speaking. “Hello, I would like to order a stuffed Koala.”
There was a pause before the receptionist continued speaking. “You said you would like to order a Koala?”
“I changed my mind. I would actually like to order a stuffed leopard.”
The man heard a click before the receptionist continued speaking. “The line is now secure. What information do you have for us?”
“Before I say anything, I get paid credits based on the information I give, with a bonus for any information that you are currently searching for, correct?”
“Yes, that is correct.”
The man let out a sigh as he nodded repeatedly. “Good, good. In that case, I have information on the top priority target sent out earlier today. The two crew members of the ship Lone Wolf are currently in the Sigma System. Their exact location as of five hours ago was…”

***

A squad of soldiers, ten in total, boarded a civilian vessel. On their shoulders was the symbol for the Federation, two planets next to each other with a shield connecting them together. The soldiers were members of the empire, their uniforms made to look like a Federation soldier. While it wouldn’t fool anyone that actually was part of the military, it was enough to fool civilians.
The merchant that the ship was registered under was dead, the ship a victim of their raids. They had only recently taken the vessel so no one would have reported it missing. Their mission was to take out the surviving members of the Lone Wolf. The ship took off, its tachyon drive powering up.
They would arrive at their destination in five hours. When they did, their prey would be dead.

***

When I woke up the next morning I went down to the sheriff’s office like I had promised. Paying the fees, they had a truck with the escape pod tied down to its flatbed drive to my house. I then paid a mechanic to come over and inspect the tachyon drive. He looked it over before telling me that some circuit boards had overloaded in the drive due to the immense current that had gone through it. I’d expected as much since that was what I’d been told would happen. The supercharged tachyon drive wasn’t a joke. I nodded before asking him if he could fix it.
He had the circuit boards with him and he swapped them out fairly quickly. It took an hour to get the repair work done and most of that time was just getting to the actual circuit boards than replacing them. I paid him for his work before going back inside. The escape pod just sat in our front yard where the truck had unloaded it. I’d have to take it to the spaceport eventually, but I didn’t see the need until I bought a ship to put it in. I’d already refueled the air thrusters, though the regular thrusters didn’t need refueling since we hadn’t used them.
I went inside the house and ordered some food. I still hadn’t stocked the kitchen, but it was starting to look like I needed to. We might be here for a while until we could get a ship. Sam had passed out on the couch, though a swift kick to the back of the sofa solved that problem. He grumbled about it for a few minutes, but he stopped once I threatened not to order breakfast for him. 

***

The ship exited warp space in the Sigma System. They called the spaceport on Bonth, requesting a tarmac to land on. Once they arrived, the ship’s cargo ramp opened up. Two jeeps rolled out from the cargo ramp, their windows tinted black. If the soldiers had simply walked out with all their gear on, there would have been too many questions. Not only that, but depending upon a taxi to provide transportation when they were going to kill someone was a very bad idea in any tactical book.
They drove their vehicles towards their target’s house. A few minutes later, they arrived. Their target lived in a secluded area, the closest house was half a mile away. The soldiers exited their vans, five from each. Two of them remained in the front while five surrounded the back. The other three became look outs as they made sure no one spotted them as they completed their sordid business. There was a large metal object in the targets front yard. None of the soldiers recognized it but they eyed it warily when they walked past it. Seeing no reaction from it, they realized it wasn’t a security measure so they stopped paying attention to it. The only thing they needed to know was that their target was inside. 

***

I was in the living room when the knock came. I rolled my eyes. The sheriff must’ve come by again. I opened the door, a slight huff escaping. “What is it?” What greeted me wasn’t the sheriff though, it was the muzzle of a laser rifle. My instincts kicked in. My hand shot out and slammed into the the gun, causing the muzzle go sideways and a brilliant ray of red light fired into the distance, causing spots to appear in my eyes. The man was in uniform with a mirrored visor and battle-armor. 
There was another person off to the side who had his own rifle. It had been aimed downwards but it was quickly brought back up towards my chest. Using my shove for momentum, I jumped backwards and slammed the door. “Secure house Gandalf!” The door immediately locked in place. The sound of a laser trying to burn through the door made me sigh in relief. 
Sam ran into the hallway, the sound of the laser firing having startled him. “What was that?!”
I gave him a grim look. “Someone is attacking the house. I’ve activated the lockdown mode but they’ll breakthrough in a matter of seconds.” I tried to access the net but I couldn’t connect. They must have signal jammers. The door was starting to glow as the heat from the lasers was melting the reinforced steel. After the I became a ‘hero’ there had been seven attempts on my life after the war. Because of that, the military had paid for my house to be fortified, which was paying off well right now.
“Tony, is there anyway to leave the house without us getting seen,” Sam asked.
I shook my head. “The alarms for the house have already gone off. The alarms are landline, so jammers won’t work on them. It won’t help though. The sheriff’s office doesn’t have the equipment to take these guys out. They’ve got tactical armor on.” Sam started to swear. “They also have laser rifles. I’ve got some equipment upstairs that you can use.”
Sam nodded and we both hurried upstairs. I unlocked the gun safe and quickly brought out the equipment. I had two plasma rifles, six needler pistols, ten smoke grenades, one concussion grenade, and four tactical vests. “Sheesh Tony, you brought a whole armory!” I shrugged. It was a little overkill, but when I bought the house I’d been more than a little stressed after the assassination attempts. It seemed like that was a good thing now.
I put on the tactical vest before grabbing the concussion grenade, two needlers, and four smoke grenades. I put the pistols in the holsters that I had strapped onto the sides of my belt before snagging the plasma rifle. The grenades went on a clip on the vest. Sam grabbed two pistols and two smoke grenades, his broken hand still posing a problem to using the plasma rifle. I heard a crash as the door to the house gave way. “Hey Sam, we’ve got visitors.”
There was a click as he put the cartridge of needles into his gun. He gave me a crazy grin as he said, “Well, let’s not keep them waiting.”
I could hear them downstairs as they swept through the house. We both stood at the top of the stairs, our rifles ready. The time when they would be most vulnerable would be when they were going up the stairs. That would be then that we’d make our move. The sound of the laser rifles firing downstairs meant that the enemy was being cautious now.
It took three minutes for them to sweep the downstairs. My hands were slick with sweat by the time we heard them starting to creep up the stairs. There was a slight sound as someone started to climb up. I exchanged a look with Sam. I held up three fingers and started counting down. When I had only one finger left, I gripped the plasma rifle and whipped around the corner already pressing the trigger. 
There was a flash of yellow as the star-hot ionized plasma was magnetically propelled out of the rifle’s chamber. The plasma struck the man in the shoulder, the plasma sizzling as it burned through the armor to flesh beneath. The man let out a desperate scream of pain that was cut short as three two-inch needles shattered the armored visor. A flash of red energy came from the bottom of the stairs.
I ducked back behind the edge of the stairs. I screamed as a laser went through the wall like it was butter and hit my vest. My back felt like it was on fire, but the vest did its job. The laser was dispersed enough to not go straight through my body but I would undoubtedly have some really bad burns.
Thick, black smoke filled the hallway. I couldn’t see past my hand. Sam must have used a smoke grenade. I was on the floor, having fallen in pain. I started to crawl on the floor, whimpering as the cotton fibers of my clothes, which had melted into my seared flesh, started to tear. I managed to make it through the pain and reach the edge of the stairs. I fired my rifle in bursts, plasma peppering the stairs. Someone stepped on my leg, probably Sam. The person quickly moved off me and my assumption was confirmed as the hiss of needles whizzing through the air joined my barrage of the downstairs. 
Flashes of red light pierced through the smoke, though the laser only left burn marks on the wall. The smoke caused the beam to attenuate too much for it to be lethal. I heard someone yell at the bottom of the stairs. One of our shots must have hit. The red light stopped as the yelling continued. I managed to stand up, though I could feel blood running down my back as the cotton fibers ripped away chunks of seared flesh from my back. I fired a couple shots towards the source of the yelling and it stopped abruptly.
I limped down the stairs but I felt it as Sam passed me by. “You alright Tony,” I heard Sam whisper.
“I took a shot to the back. It didn’t pierce but I’m pretty badly burned,” I whispered back.
I continued limping down the stairs. Once I reached the bottom, I headed towards the front door. The smoke cleared as I got closer to the door. The front door was open, letting me see the two armored cars in front. I cursed. There was no way that only two people had come from those cars. 
“Sam, we need to get to the escape pod. Now.”
He chuckled wryly from his position beside the door. “You know, this is the second time in the past two days you’ve had to tell me that.”
I chuckled as well before unclipping the smoke grenades from my belt. I passed one to Sam with its pin already pulled, which he grabbed with a thankful nod. Pulling the pin from one grenade, I chucked it out the door. It landed in the middle of the lawn as it started to belch out thick black smoke. I threw two more while Sam just threw his two. The smoke wouldn’t be as effective outside, but we would need it for cover.
The smoke covered practically the entire front lawn. I heard a couple yells from the sides of the house and from the front of the house. I started to run towards the escape pod that was still, thankfully, in the front yard. My injuries were slowing me down, but I made it. The men outside hadn’t started firing blindly, apparently afraid of friendly fire. Thank god.
Because of the smoke, I couldn’t see very far, but I made it to the escape pod. I climbed in through the open hatch to find Sam already working the controls. His pistol was on the console while his one good arm was frantically moving. I quickly took his place as I started the thrusters. Double checking that the hatches were all closed, I sat down in the chair and strapped in. Sam  strapped in as well and we took off. The escape pod rumbled as the thrusters put thousands of pounds of force onto the ground. The exhaust from the thrusters blew the smoke away, revealing the metallic lump that was the escape pod as it started to fly away. Several lasers struck the outside of the pod, but they didn't damage  it. The armor served us well.
The escape pod was deliberately designed to look like scrap metal to make it less likely for it to be picked up. Some aerodynamic functions were given up, but it meant that the attackers hadn’t realized that we had an escape pod. Thanks to that, we were able to escape. The thrusters carried us out of range of the soldiers very quickly, the entire pod vibrating as we flew.
We reached the exosphere in a couple of minutes. I actually didn’t make it. The shaking caused my back to constantly rub against the back of the seat. The pain was like a hundred white-hot spikes driving into me over and over again. When I came back around, Sam was standing over me. Glancing at my shoulder, I could see the pain patch that he’d applied. “Thanks Sam, I needed that. How long was I out?”
Sam grinned at me. “Well, now it’s your turn to be taken care of by Doctor Sam. Anyway, you’ve been out for around two minutes.”
I chuckled as well. “Well, Doctor Sam, Considering the fact that we’re being hunted, we need to get somewhere safe. I don’t know where that could be, but I think going to the core is our best bet.”
Sam shook his head. “I took a close look on the guy we shot. He had the symbol of the Federation on his shoulder. You know, the one with two planets connected by a shield? The core might be a death trap.”
I laughed. “Sam, don’t you know that our military doesn’t use the Federation symbol on their uniforms? The military symbol is a sword connecting two planets, not a shield.”
Sam blinked. “What?”
I chuckled. “It’s a common mistake, but it also helps us from being infiltrated. MP’s wear the Federation symbol and all publicized photos of soldiers have the Federation symbol on their uniform. We encourage that misconception. Whoever attacked us was simply trying to put the blame on the Federation. Anyway, do you think we should go to the core or not?”
Sam thought about it for a second before nodding. “Yeah, since the Federation isn’t to blame. Maybe you can pull a few strings so that we can get protection from the military. It wouldn’t be the first time.”
I sighed. “Maybe, I’m not sure though. I’ll take us as deep into the core as I can. It should be enough to shake our pursuers off. Whoever they are, they won’t be able to move so openly on a core world.”
With that, I used the ship’s navigation computer to input the coordinates. We were going to Hilden.

***

The soldiers gathered together after the botched assassination attempt. Their captain was furious at their failure, though he merely looked sternly at his men. They had overlooked a critical component that let their quarry get away! The reaction from Admiral Belthos would not be pleasant for him, not pleasant at all. As the anger in him burned furiously, the distant sound of sirens could be heard. He reigned in his emotions at the sound.
It must be the police. All of his men fired their laser guns on continuous burn, sweeping the front lawn of their escaped quarry. Their lasers weren’t very effective against the house, only causing a few scorch marks to appear. It was able to catch the grass and a few shrubs on fire though. It would distract the law long enough for them to escape. They had already retrieved the dead bodies to prevent any evidence of their involvement. The armored cars drove swiftly away from the house towards the airport. 
Not even a minute later, five police cars pulled up to the house. Three officers ran into the house to try and save anyone that was inside while another called the fire department. No one saw the cars leave or the spaceship that took off ten minutes later.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 12</h1>

We appeared on the very fringes of Hilden. The tenth planet could be seen far off in the distance, though the giant red star dominated the view. I activated the emergency beacon and waited for a rescue. We didn’t wait long. Two minutes later, a fairly small Navy ship appeared a mile from us. Our communications lit up as they contacted us. “This is the Corvette Rellard. Why is your distress beacon activated?”
Good. It was the Federation. “This is Tony Delgado of the cargo ship Lone Wolf. While we were on Bonth in the Sigma System we came under attack by forces on the ground. We managed to get away in our escape pod, which is why we’re here.”
There was a very long pause. Well, it was kinda hard to believe. “This is a very concerning report. Do you have any proof of the attack?”
Sam took over. “I’ve got a broken arm and Tony has burns on his back from a laser.”
“Who is that?” the Corvette asked.
I grabbed the comm back from him, mouthing at him to be quiet. “That was Sam Forzet. We are the only people on the escape pod.”
“Alright. We’ll have to contact the authorities on Sigma to see if your story holds up. In the meantime, we’ve already sent a shuttle to pick you up. It’ll dock with you in about two minutes. We’ll give you a check-up once you’re on board.”
“Thanks.”
Just like he said, two minutes later there was a thud as the shuttle docked with us. I checked and the pod said that there was oxygen and pressure on the other side of the airlock. I opened the door and climbed aboard the shuttle. Inside were five marines, their weapons aimed at me. “Put the guns on the ground! Slowly!” one of them yelled at me. On his shoulder was an emblem depicting a  sword with its blade in one planet and the hilt on another, connecting them. Looks like they really are from the Federation. 
I let out a relieved sigh as I slowly removed the two needler pistols from my waist. Honestly, I had forgotten I still had them with me. I heard a clanking sound behind me. Sam must have gotten rid of his own pistol. I also removed the grenade, handing it to one of the marines. The marine verified that the pin was still in the grenade before accepting it. Once that was out of the way, we were both escorted to a bench where we put on the seatbelt harness. Two marines went onboard and took a copy of the ships systems. Luckily we had already burned the data that showed our jump from the asteroid belt to the Sigma System.
After they retrieved the data, the shuttle detached from the escape pod before flying towards the Corvette. Once we were on board, several scanners were used to verify that we didn’t have anything harmful on us. Once that was done, we were escorted to the medical bay.
The doctor there peeled my shirt away from my skin. The pain meds were still active, so all I felt was a slight itch as my skin was ripped away with the fibers of my clothes.  Blood flowed freely down my back, the warm liquid tickled and caused me to shiver. The doctor applied another anesthetic before spraying something on my back. It must have been a blood clotter of some sort, since the blood stopped flowing only a minute later. Taking a wet towel, the doctor had me lie down on my belly and cleaned all the blood off me. They wrapped a large cloth bandage around my chest repeatedly to cover the wounds.
Once that was done, I was told to remain in the room. Sam had been taken to a separate room, probably to prevent us from getting our stories straight. It seemed to me as though the Federation had become paranoid in the years I’d been absent.
Half an hour later, I was escorted out of the room by two marines. I was taken off the ship straight to a non-descript room with white walls and a desk in the middle of the room. The marines sat me down in the chair before cuffing both my hands to the table. Soon after a man in a grey business suit arrived. He had a tablet in his hand which he set on the table.
He coughed, clearing his throat, before sitting down. His hands steepled in front of him on the table. “So, I’ve heard you have an unbelievable story to tell me. Please go ahead and explain the details of how you ended up in the Hilden System in an escape pod.”
I laughed. Honestly, I couldn’t help it. It was a laughter that just couldn’t be stopped. If I hadn’t been handcuffed, I would’ve been on the floor by now. The pent-up stress from the past two days was released as I just laughed my head off. It took a couple minutes for me to stifle it, though the disapproving look the man in the grey suit was giving me the whole time helped out a lot in that regard. “S-sorry” I gasped out as I tried to catch my breath. “I just can’t, hehe, can’t, haha!” I just started giggling again.
Finally, I managed to take a deep breath and compose myself. I faced the man in the grey suit with a serious expression on my face. “Sorry about that. It’s been a very stressful two days. This whole situation just struck me as a little incredulous.”
The man glared at me. “Well, now that we have that out of the way, can you go ahead and tell me about this ridiculous story you have?”
I shrugged. “Sure. First though, can we introduce ourselves”
The man sighed. “I’m a military legal consultant here at Hilden. You can call me Matt.”
I nodded. “Well Matt, my name is Tony Delgado. I was in the spaceforce for the Federation. If you wouldn’t mind, could you search for my files? I think that should give you some more credence to my words.”
Matt shook his head. “You aren’t exactly in the position to make demands here.”
I raised an eyebrow. “Oh? I didn’t know I was in any trouble. My escape pod was forced to jump here after I was attacked. That isn’t a crime to my knowledge.”
“It may not have been, but it could be now. If we suspect that you are pirate sympathizers, then we are legally allowed to detain you until we are provided proof that you are not sympathizers according to Mandate 169.4.5 section C, subsection 2.” Matt looked at me smugly as he listed out that little fact.
I shrugged. “I guess they passed a new law then. How new is that, by the way?”
“About a week actually.”
“Oh good. I thought there must be something wrong with the frontier network, but we just haven’t been off our claim until three days ago, so it makes sense. I haven’t had the time to go through the news yet. Humor me though, just look at my military record before you do anything.”
Matt sighed before accessing his tablet. “I don’t want you to think I’m a hardnose, so I guess I’ll do it. If I don’t find anything though, you’re going to be stuck with rations for your stay here.”
I shuddered at that. “Are you trying to kill me?”
It was Matt’s turn to chuckle. “I guess you weren’t joking about being in the military at least. You look a little young though.”
“The record will explain.”
Matt rolled his eyes before turning back to his tablet. I saw a puzzled look come across his face about five minutes later. Matt stood up and walked towards the door, his mouth already moving. “You will have to excuse me as your military files are too high rank for me to view. I’ll have to get permission from the base commander before I can access them. At least this proves that something in here is worth finding out about.”
I sighed. “Go ahead, take your time.”
I was in that room for thirty minutes. My wrists had red lines on them from being pressed against the handcuffs. My back was starting to bother me as whatever anesthetic the doctor had applied was starting to wear off. The two marines that had been standing guard outside suddenly rushed inside. They took off the handcuffs and escorted me to another room. This time it was an office with very nice decor. The marines remained outside while one of them opened.
When I walked in, there was a man ther with the rank of Captain. He saluted me the second I walked in, though he did wait for the door to close. “I’m very sorry sir for your treatment here. If we had known that you were the Hero of Kaleesh, we would have treated you very differently.”
I waved my hand. “Not a big deal. I took up a fake identity to leave that life behind. I’m honestly surprised you have the rank to access my files.”
The Captain had an embarrassed smile on his face. “To access your files requires a Rear Vice Admiral, one rank above me. I called the Federation HQ and they gave me temporary access. The fake identity combined with the plastic surgery certainly threw us off.”
I nodded. “It was a security measure that was offered to certain high-profile veterans after they retired. Anyway, we should probably talk about our encounter.”
The Captain nodded. “Agreed Rear Vice Admiral.” I huffed at that. I’d only been a squadron commander but, due to meritorious acts, I was given the rank Rear Vice Admiral upon my dismissal from military service. I wasn’t proud of my rank. Heck, I didn’t even think I had earned it.
“Anyway, we were on our mining claim in the Petral Mining System when a Destroyer warped into the system. It used a tachyon disrupter to prevent us from jumping…” I continued with my explanation, detailing how we had been attacked on Bonth by soldiers posing as the Federation. It only took about five minutes, since there wasn’t much to really say. When I finished, the Captain was looking decidedly uneasy.
“So, you were attacked twice within two days. One was an attack in a mining system where no one else was and the other was on the surface of a frontier planet by soldiers posing as Federation soldiers?”
I nodded. “That just about sums it up.”
The Captain sighed before leaning back in his chair. “I’ll submit a report to HQ. They already mentioned that they would like to send an investigation team to Bonth and Petral. Meanwhile, I would like to put you and your friend under protective custody.”
“Thank you Captain, that would be mighty helpful. I would like it if you could keep the news of our arrival out of any reports and order no one to mention the recovery of our escape pod. Additionally, I would like to see if I could organize something with the higher ups if possible.”
“HQ already ordered the whole event to be classified. Don’t worry, no one will know that your escape pod landed here. As for you getting in touch with HQ, you can send any requests you would like using the computer systems here. Your old military login and password were reactivated shortly after finding out you were here. Anyway, I am sure you are exhausted by now, so I’ll take you to a room you can stay at until your protective custody can be arranged.”
“Thanks Captain.” I followed him out of the office to the spaceport. There were some military barracks and a few houses set-up for the officers at the base. He gave me access to one of the houses before leaving me alone. I shut the door to the house before leaning against the wall with a sigh.
That went well. We were now protected from whoever wanted to kill us. At the sametime, we might be able to find out just who wanted to kill us. The inspection of the mining system on Petral wouldn’t reveal much. We had set-up dummy equipment with some hand-mining tools such as some laser drills and containers of partially mined rocks. While Sam had been prepping all the equipment the first week, I had started creating a fake mining site. I hadn’t been able to do much, but it would be enough to withstand casual inspection. 
Of course, since the inspection was taking place in the wrong system, they wouldn’t find out who sent the destroyer. It was far more likely that we would find out who sent the fake Federation soldiers though. What really concerned me was the fact that the soldiers tried to kill us on a Federation planet, even if it was a frontier planet.That meant someone was willing to kill us even if it drew the Federationa to them. Whoever they were, they weren’t afraid of the consequences.
The destroyer attacking us seemed to be a little underwhelming in light of that threat. Sure, a destroyer attacking a cargo ship in an isolated system was deadlier, but it also showed restraint. Whoever attacked us didn’t want attention and were afraid of discovery by the Federation. They were cautious compared the recklessness of the soldiers. That was why the soldiers scared me. The soldiers showed that they would be willing to take risks to kill us, even ones that hardened mercenaries wouldn’t take. It reminded of the Empire’s deathsworn honestly. Maybe that's why they scared me.
The destroyer attack still bothered me though. They must have used a tracking program to find us, it wouldn’t take much considering the quality of our ship. I was strongly leaning towards it being a pirate crew that actually had some brains and technical know-how. It fit with the whole stalking thing. But then again, why would they have blown us up instead of boarding us? They didn’t even radio us to heave-to. That didn’t fit with pirate policy. Ugh. 
It looked more and more as though someone simply wanted to kill us. It could even be two different groups, since both their tactics and concerns regarding the Federation were different. Still, was it just a coincidence that both assassination attempts, for that was what they looked like to me, occured within a few days of each other? It couldn’t be. 
Their motives still remained a mystery to me though. The only thing I could honestly think of was that someone wanted to kill a hero from the galactic war. Possibly some Empire fanatics. I recalled how the soldiers reminded me of the deathsworn. Could some of them still be alive, attempting to carry out some mission given by the emperor? That didn’t make sense though! It had been so long since the war and the Empire was destroyed. Why would they attack us when the war had ended four years ago? If there were any deathsworn still alive, they would have attacked us long ago. Their loyalty to the Empire demanded it. Argh! The more I thought about it, the more muddied the view became.
I suppose, the only thing I really needed to know was that someone wanted to kill me. The protective custody should solve that issue though. What I really needed was to find some pain-meds and get some sleep. My back was starting to really hurt now. It was only a dull throb, but it would get worse. I went to the bathroom, brushing a razor on the sink aside. Opening up the medicine cabinet I found some pain patches and applied them, their dosage of morphine going straight to my bloodstream. Finally, some relief. After that I found the closest soft object, a couch, and passed out.

***

Admiral Belthos slammed his fist onto a nearby console. His fist throbbed from the impact, but the pain did not ease his anger. A destroyer and a squad of imperial soldiers. They hadn’t accomplished anything! Those murderers had killed his brother yet they were still alive! The incompetence of his subordinates was infuriating!
The report detailing their failures was still open beside him. If those murderers had been killed, no one but the Empire would know about the asteroid belt. When his advisors had been told of the situation yesterday, many of them had suggested waiting until they were killed before attempting to mine the asteroid belt. While that would have been a massive relief to Belthos, he also knew that war was about risks. 
The mobile shipyard was currently warping to the asteroid belt along with most of his fleet. The only thing protecting the shadow planets now were a handful of destroyers and corvettes. The raiding parties were still doing their duty, but practically every single ship not busy with a different assignment had been transported to the asteroid belt.
The move seemed risky, far riskier than any of his advisors expected. They were used to their admiral being cautious, to the point that one could call it cowardice. When the Admiral had explained his reasoning though, many of them came around to his point of view.
With this many ships in the system, the only way the Federation could attempt to attack them would be if they made a major offensive. The transit time for such a massive amount of ships would be a few days, if they wanted to arrive all at once that is. They would need to leave many of their planets undefended if they wanted to do that. Forget their spies, even the public would know that something was up. So long as they detected a massive movement of Federation ships, the Empire would start to immediately leave the asteroid belt. They could have all their equipment and ships gone within a matter of hours. There was practically no risk.
If he only brought a few ships, the Federation would be able to bring in fewer ships as well, making it more likely that they would miss the attack. If they lost the mobile shipyard, it would be a massive blow to the Empire’s cause. They didn’t have anything to build more ships, so they would have to seize a real shipyard fm the Federation. In that case, they would need to defend a static target, something that was a huge disadvantage to the Empire because of their fewer ships. It was too risky to not defend the mobile shipyard. This was the right move.
Admiral Belthos got up and paced the room, his entire body radiating fury. It took him a couple minutes before he managed to get his anger under control. What managed to relax him was this fact, it didn’t matter. Even if those miserable little cargo haulers told the Federation of the asteroid belt, nothing would happen. The Federation couldn’t hurt them without leaving themselves vulnerable. At the same time, the Empire would be able to leave before the Federation ever got to them.
What about his revenge? Well, revenge was always a dish best served cold. Within the next two years, the Federation would be at his feet. When that time came, he would find those cargo haulers and make them suffer like his brother had.


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 13</h1>

I banked the fighter sideways, avoiding the enemy fighter as it blew right past me. “Stay in formation!” I yelled into the comms. “Keep flying towards the dreadnought! This is the last one still alive! We take it down and we take the throneworld!”
A chorus of cheers came over the squadron’s comms, though some of them cutoff mid-cheer. I grimaced as two fighters disappeared from my nav.
I could see through the fighters viewscreen the wreckage of hundreds of ships. Part of a massive ship could be seen at the far edge. Gas streamed from gashes in the hull while metallic debris floated around, and away from, the derelict ship. The lights on the ship were flickering before they suddenly cut off.
Directly ahead of me was a twin to that wrecked ship. Unlike the broken ship, this one had a bright blue shield around it. Flashes of light whizzed through space as plasma turrets belted out dozens of star-hot projectiles at the different fighter squadrons that swarmed it. I saw missiles flying from the dreadnought towards our own battleships.
“Press on!” I heard someone yell. Our squad of two hundred fighters had already been cut down to only seventy. We flew straight towards the dreadnought. Multiple EMP missiles fired from our fighters, causing the dreadnoughts shields to disappear in holes around the impacts.
Our squad aimed for those holes, trying desperately to make it through the gap before it closed. Thirty of our ships made it through the holes before the shield projectors of the dreadnought managed to reboot. The rest either rammed into the shields and vanished in a fiery inferno or looped around to rejoin the fight going on outside. Each fighter only had room for one EMP missile, so they had missed their only chance. 
I could see the turrets that had previously been focused on other ships swiveling towards us. Hundreds of turrets that studded the hull of the hulking dreadnought were pointed right at us. “Evasive actions!” I yelled. “Take out the bridge! If we take that down, then this ship is just piece of floating metal!”
I pulled straight up as a verifiable storm of plasma bolts sailed below me. I could see five of my fellow fighters above me. One of their shields flared as a plasma bolt hit it. Before he could change direction, another bolt hit his shield and went straight through it, cutting through the engine of the fighter. I swerved as his ship exploded in a fiery inferno. My shield dropped down from sixty to fifty-two percent as shrapnel impacted my shield.
My ship corkscrewed as I dodged some more plasma bolts before I fired on the dreadnought. A missile port that was just opening to let out a missile exploded, the missile detonating as well. The explosion tore a large rent in the ship’s side, but the damage wasn’t nearly enough to take this monstrosity down. 
Glancing at the nav, I saw the lights indicating my friends and fellow fighter pilots wink out one by one. It was sporadic at first, but it happened faster and faster as the turrets focused on fewer targets. I could see a smoking crater where two main guns had been destroyed. I looped around as I saw my target. Two fighters were beside me.
“Squadron Leader, I’m going in!” One of them yelled.
“Remember the targets!” I yelled back in response.
Our priority target, the bridge, was buried beneath the ships armor. The fighter in front of me launched all his missiles at one part of the armor, the missiles staggered to prevent them from being set off in a chain explosion.
The metal armor of the dreadnought held steady, only warping slightly from the fifty ton explosive. The fighter beside me tried to fire his missiles but a plasma bolt sheared off his wing. I saw the data from his ship as his reactor started to overload. I banked as I avoided a plasma bolt. It put me at the right angle to see his ship ram straight into the dreadnoughts armor.
His reactor and ammunition blew up simultaneously. The armor of the dreadnought ripped off, the shrapnel destroying the only other fighter still flying. It was just me. One hundred and ninety-nine pilots killed, all so I could take this shot. My whole body was shaking with anger and sadness that I was barely keeping under control. I aimed my ship straight at the hole in the dreadnought. My missiles flew at the hole, only to suddenly veer off to the side. The blew up around me, my ship sailing right past the dreadnought. A plasma bolt flew towards my ship head on. The orange glow got closer and closer until-
I woke up screaming. My hand clutched at my chest, sure that it was being burned by the plasma. The only thing I could feel was my heart pounding like a set of drums. I stumbled out of bed, making my way to the bathroom. I retched in the toilet, the bile leaving an awful slime in my mouth. I rinsed my mouth out and spat to get rid of the taste. My heart was still racing. It wasn’t until I splashed my face with some cold water that I managed to calm myself. I stayed in the bathroom after that, too shaken to go back to bed.

“Score!” Sam yelled as the ball soared past me into the net. He floated in midair, doing some weird moves. “Oh yeah, I won, I won. Who’s the winner now, huh Tony?”
I sighed as I bumped into the ceiling. “You are, Sam.” I started to float away, kicking off the wall towards the ground.
He cupped his hand around his ear. “What was that? I couldn’t quite hear you?”
Enough of this. Accessing the holo-controls, I turned the gravity back on. “Yeah, I’m the winneeaaghhh!” I was at the perfect angle to witness Sam crash into the ground, his victory high brought back down to earth.
I started laughing as Sam rubbed his butt tenderly, having landed on it when he fell. He glared at me. “Sore loser.” He muttered under his breath.
I gave him the biggest grin I could. “Sore winner more like it.”
He glared at me when I said it, but I glared right back. After a few seconds of staring at each other, we both dissolved into giggles. Once we stopped laughing, I headed towards the side of the grav-ball court. Currently we were at a military base for our protection. It was on the moon of a gas-giant, established as an early warning system. There were only thirty men manning it, ten of which were support staff and the other twenty were fighter pilot teams. They were told that we were transfers from another base, letting us blend in with the troops. I kinda enjoyed getting back in the fighter jockey life.
There was nothing quite like getting into a fighter. The feel of its engines thundering to life, ready to take off into the skies. Sam was loving it too. He was finally able to get his hands on the latest gear that they were putting into fighters. I’d heard far too many of his complaints about our old ship. He was excited to tinker with machinery that wasn’t rusting apart.
On the other hand, it was bringing back memories that I wasn’t too fond of. The nightmare from last night was proof of that. It was during that fight that I became known as the Hero of Kaleesh, the one that ended the fight with the Empire. While in my dream the missiles had gone astray, in reality they had hit their mark. The Emperor was on the dreadnought I had destroyed. When he died, so did the Empire. That was the reason I had became so famous. I was the one that was credited with ending the war with the Empire.
Numerous medals, such as the medal of honor, purple heart, and medal of valour, were bestowed on me. I hated them all. The casualties in that battle alone accounted for over a third of all the militant casualties in the war. That was how brutal it had become.
The total casualties in that war was 1.2 trillion people. Of that trillion people, only eight billion were military casualties. That meant that close to three billion people died in that fight. While there had been nuclear weapon accords from the previous galactic wars, that hadn’t stopped anyone. The Empire first used nuclear weapons on a Federation ship facility, annihilating the world that it was on. This prompted the Federation to start using nuclear weapons against the Empire as well, nuking several military facilities. The targets for nuclear attack were always purely military, no civilian settlements were on the planetary bodies that were nuked. Then, the Empire annihilated an entire world that a military outpost was embedded in. That included the 2.7 billion civilians that were on that world. There was a general outburst of public rage, but it was ignored in favor of destroying planetary defenses. The Empire enjoyed a technological advantage, but they were vastly outnumbered by the Federation. They didn’t have the men or ships to lose in a drawn out invasion. Plus, they didn’t really care about the citizens. They were Federation citizens, not Imperial citizens after all.
Anyways, back to the fight for the throneworld. To even get the fighters close enough to infiltrate the dreadnoughts shields we had sacrificed practically our entire fleet. There had been two hundred and fifty fighter squadrons that attacked the three dreadnoughts. I was the leader of one of those squadrons.  Of those fifty thousand people that went into the fight, only four hundred remained when the fight ended. That was only the fighter casualties. 
The only reason we had won was because the fighters had hidden behind our capital ships as they charged toward the dreadnoughts. Without that cover, the turrets and support vessels of the dreadnought would have ripped apart our fighters. When we still had capital ships at the beginning of the fight, they all fired at one of the dreadnoughts. All of our battleships, destroyers, and cruisers all firing at a single ship, yet its shields didn’t go down for ten minutes and even then its shields would come partially online every other minute. That was the power of the dreadnought. The other two dreadnoughts were taken out by fighters that infiltrated their shields. 
We were lucky in that attack. They had thought that we couldn’t attack the throneworld since their fleet was starting an offensive in a different section of space. We sent half of our fleet to stop the offensive while the other half jumped to the throneworld. The tachyon drives of the fleets were tied to the admirals, allowing us to keep our fleets and any spies on board in the dark. The only ones that knew where each one was jumping were the admirals commanding each fleet.
Because both fleets jumped at the same time, the Empire assumed that both were going to the aid of the core where they were attacking. It caught them off guard when half of the Federations forces appeared at the throneworld. At that time, the Federation outnumbered the Empire ten to one. By the end of the battle for Kaleesh, as it became known, we only outnumbered the Empire five to one.
The fleet that we sent to stop the Empire also took casualties, cutting down our numerical superiority even further. The Empire had always had a technological advantage, which was the reason why they managed to halt our advances. That advantage showed when the fleet was split in half. Still, they managed to halt the Empires advance and put them on retreat with help from the Core’s planetary defenses and some very brilliant strategies. It wasn’t without costs though. Four planets were left completely incinerated and another seventeen had to deal with nuclear fallout, two of our biggest shipyards was destroyed as well.
When the Imperial Armada was retreating, intending to resupply and rebuild, they discovered that the Emperor was already dead. Their ships retreated to another world and prepared to defend the Empire. Before the Federation could go on the offensive, internal rivalries caused rebellion in the Empires military. A portion of it surrendered to the Federation while the rest disappeared, along with Admiral Belthos. The Empire fell apart and all the star systems that were previously under it surrendered to the Federation unanimously.
Raiding began as some Imperials that fled turned to piracy, but most of the ships that disappeared couldn’t be accounted for. Based upon the accounts, the numerical superiority for the Federation was now three to one. The Empire’s technology had been a term of the surrender, which allowed the entire Federal fleet to be upgraded. Without a technologically superior force, our numerical superiority would destroy Admiral Belthos in a frontal attack. That was, to the extent of my knowledge, the situation of the Federation and the remaining Imperial forces.
While I had been recalling the military situation, I’d been chowing down on a ham sandwich. I swallowed as I ate the last bite, grimacing at how dry the crust had been. Sam wiped his mouth, having just chugged the last of his milk. Another fighter pilot was in the mess hall making a sandwich. Someone tapped me on the shoulder. Turning, I saw one of the other men on the base. His uniform meant that he was on active duty at the moment. “Sir, you’ve been ordered to the comms.”  He pointed at Sam. “You too.”
We both looked at each other before shrugging. Sam threw away his milk before patting the man on his shoulder. “Roger that.”
When we stepped into the comm station, everyone else had been ordered to leave. Sam activated the comm. Just like I had figured, the Captain appeared on the comms. He saluted as soon as he saw me. “Rear Vice Admiral, Lieutenant” he nodded to me and Sam in turn. While Sam had been promoted after the war, it hadn’t been as much as me. He had only played a supportive role after all. Glory and publicity demanded that I be pushed above him. I hated it, but I knew the public couldn’t be dissuaded.
“Captain, what news do you have?” I asked. He had called twice the whole time we were here. Once to see if we needed anything and another to inform us that their investigation was almost done.
The Captain sighed. “Well, the investigation is done. Unfortunately, it is nothing substantial. The inspection of Petral showed that they were very thorough. They didn’t touch any of your mining equipment and cleaned up any wreckage from your ship. There might be fragments, but they were lost in the oort cloud. If you hadn’t survived, we would have never known that you were dead.” Well, that was a relief. They were blaming the lack of evidence on the shrewdness of the attackers. What I was really interested in though, was what he would say next.
“As for the other attack, we had better luck. Fifteen minutes before the attack on your house, a merchant ship that had been missing for the past three months landed at the spaceport next to your house. Ten minutes after the attack, the ship took off. We attempted to track down the owner, but he was apparently on the ship when it went missing. He hadn’t made it to the missing person’s list since no one had repored him as missing.”
“Scans of the attack site on Bonth have shown that the laser rifles were XTL-71 rifles. They are standard issue used by the military for infiltration. The rifles have a very low energy signature and can avoid most weapon detectors. That explains why you weren’t blinded or killed when they shot you. The XTL-71s are underpowered because of their stealthy nature. If they were using a different model, you would be dead.”
“Our conclusion for the moment is that pirates used a hijacked merchant vessel to carry out an assassination attempt. Their motive, besides the obvious, remains a mystery. The ship they hijacked was found scuttled, left abandoned and destroyed in a nearby system. As far as we can tell, it was merely some Imperial fanatics that got lucky when they discovered some Federation veterans were living there. We suspect that there are two groups that are trying to kill you, but we can’t find anything about the first attack.”
I sighed when I heard the news. “So basically, you haven’t found anything out yet?”
The Captain had the good graces to look embarrassed. “No, we haven’t. There has also been no attempt to locate either of you two after you went into protective custody, so we can conclude that whoever it was that was trying to kill you aren’t too hung up on it. If you want to, we can stop the protective custody and have you transferred out. Just say the word.”
Sam spoke up. “I say take me out. I want to check out our claim again, just to see if they took anything.”
I nodded. “I agree with Sam. Take us out of protective custody as soon as you can.”
The Captain nodded. “Agreed. You’ll be transferred within the week. Also, your request to buy a stealth ship has been accepted. I sent the details, along with the price tag, to the communicator. Go ahead and check it out. Anyways, there is nothing else I need to discuss. Is there anything you want to talk to me about?”
I turned to Sam who shook his head. I turned back to the Captain. “Nope. Have a good day Captain.”
“You too Sir.” He saluted as the display turned off. I huffed in irritation at the salute before accessing the comms. Just like he had said, the ship information was there. Man, it was a beauty. It looked like it was almost flat and shaped like a boomerang. The ship was painted black, black as space actually. Various small panels protruded all over its surface, in order to minimize detection. Its stealth systems included a lead lined interior and a thermoregulator on the surface of the ship. It would allow our ship to match the temperature of the surrounding space and blend in with any thermal scans. 
It was a stealth corvette, its schematics promising that it would live up to its name. It had a fission reactor with five times the power it should have for a ship in the corvette class. It was closer to what you would expect from a destroyer. Then again, I hadn’t stuck around long enough in the Navy for the ships to be updated, so maybe this was normal now.
The engines for the ship were covered with cowls to prevent heat and radiation leakage. The armor it had on the ship was thick and actually absorbed radiation, making it even less likely that we would be discovered from radar. Honestly, I only glanced at the features. What I was really absorbed in was the speed. The reaction time for the thrusters, the sheer amount of acceleration. Whew, I couldn’t wait to pilot that ship!  Sam was just as excited. He was studying the technical outline of the ship.
“WHAT!” Sam and I exclaimed at the same time. We apparently saw the price tag at the same time. It was sitting pretty at eight hundred thousand credits. Sure, it was of a higher quality than the ship we had picked out for six hundred thousand credits. Still, I didn’t see anything that made it worth that much.
I said as much to Sam. “This ship ain’t worth it. Sure, the radiation and thermal leakage is better, plus the thrust system is amazing. Still, it isn’t a two hundred thousand credit difference.”
Sam had immediately started scouring the schematics again. He brought up a finger, telling me to be quiet. I rolled my eyes, but I decided to humor him. Finally, he turned to me. “You’re right, this ship might not be worth it, if that was all it has. However, it has something that we need. Weapons.”
I huffed. “Sam, having a ballistic turret isn’t exactly necessary.”
Now it was Sam’s turn to huff. “Well yeah, a ballistic turret isn’t going to sell me on it either. The ship has two recessed ballistic turrets and a plasma sprayer, but that’s the basic stuff. This thing has a directional EMP cannon. All that radiation the armor absorbs has to go somewhere. Turns out, it gets stored in the EMP along with the bleed-off from the fusion reactor. Not only that, but it has a fluctuating energy shield. That shield matches background magnetic signals, no one would even know the ship is there and we would still have the shields up. Apparently the shield is recent technology developed from tech that Empire had been working on. They hadn’t cracked matching background magnetic radiation, but our scientists managed to do so last year. This is their first actual product.”
I would have paid the extra two hundred thousand upon hearing it had an EMP. Ship shields were meant to block background radiation, intense thermal activity, and kinetic energy. An EMP was a concentrated blast of electrons, causing the shield to experience a burst of power and short out the shield projectors. EMP cannons hadn’t been developed until after the war had ended unfortunately, but that didn’t mean I didn’t appreciate them. Unless they had backup emitters, like the dreadnoughts had, they were toast. Any ship that was smaller than a battleship, such as the destroyer that tried to kill us, would at minimum have their shields short out and anything smaller than a corvette would probably be dead in the water.
While the huge upgrade in battle power was certainly welcome, it was the fluctuating energy shield that really sold me. Stealth ships required stealth, as their name implied. Energy was easily detectable in space. The two most common forms were heat from thrusters and radiation from its reactors. Energy shields were made of magnetic fields, making them light up like a flare at midnight to the sensors of most ships. 
Back in the war, stealth ships were considered to be glass cannons. They would sneak up on targets and fire, without anyone knowing they were there. At the same time, if they were found out, they would die without even knowing how. Without their shields, their armor was often punctured by any casual shot from a warship. That wouldn’t happen with this ship. I emphasized safety first and this really helped out in that department.
Still, when I saw the features of the ship I got suspicious. This thing would easily go for over a million credits, probably closer 1.3 or 1.4 million. There was no way it would be 8k. I got to the footnote at the bottom. There was a note that the ship had previously been an experimental prototype to research the fluctuating energy shield. The ship had proven the experiment to be a success three months ago. The ship was retired and scheduled to be scuttled now that it wasn’t needed anymore. Due to my request, the Federation had decided they would cancel the scheduled destruction and sell it to me.
Well, that was the military for you. I knew it wasn’t for altruistic reasons. They were basically selling me a second-hand prototype. Scratch that. That was exactly what they were doing. Sigh. Despite knowing what they were doing, I was going to fall for it. Hook, line, and sinker.
Sam had been studying my face as the various emotions ran across it. “You done staring?” I asked him.
He shook his head, his face dead serious. “Nope. I still haven’t seen the seventh stage of grief yet.”
Despite my glare at him, I let out a chuckle. “Grief may not be what’s going on here.”
Sam cocked his head inquisitively. “So, you’re saying paying eight hundred thousand credits for a ship isn’t causing you grief?”
There was no way to win against him, so I simply ignored what he was saying. “We’re going to buy it, aren’t we?”
Sam became serious. “Yeah. Honestly, this gives us exactly what we need to survive on the frontier. Not only that, but this thing has the same amount of cargo space as our last ship. We can still haul if we want to.”
“Heh. Before we get back in that rut, how about we just figure out if our claim is still valid.”


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 14</h1>

The transfer out of the outpost was flawless. The transfer request was given to the base commander on the same day. The next day, we were on a ship heading towards New Rome. Once we arrived at the military post there, the base commander treated us as guests, giving us a small house. I don’t know what they told them, but it was good enough for the commander, that much I know.
The next day we took a shuttle to a different military base. Once we were there, we met a Rear Vice Admiral. This military base was a research facility apparently. The Rear Vice Admiral asked us to pay for the stealth ship, which we promptly did. Then we were lead to a small spaceport. Our ship was out on the tarmac, its black exterior seeming to absorb all the light and color around it. Honestly, that wasn’t too far off the mark.
We were given access to the ship and told to launch within an hour. Sam inspected the reactor and the engines while I started changing the ship’s hud. I programmed in some basic maneuvers while also linking the weaponry to Sam’s controls.
It took us about half an hour before we had everything set-up the way we wanted. Once that was accomplished, it was time to take off. I told the research facility we were taking off. They gave us the green light a few seconds later.
When they did, my face lit up in a face-splitting grin. Sam had already strapped into the gunner’s chair. All military personnel had been trained to use turrets in an emergency, though Sam was particularly good at it.
I accessed the engine controls and lit it up. There was a rumbling sound as the chemical engines started up. My body was pressed into the seat, my grin widening with the g-force. I heard Sam letting out loud whoops of joy which I promptly joined in on. The ship rocketed up through the atmosphere, quickly reaching the void of space.
I was laughing the whole time, the thrill of moving so fast overwhelming me. Sam was laughing alongside me. Honestly, it was nice to just let loose. Knowing that we would have to investigate the asteroid belt was causing my stomach to do flip-flops. Still, we needed to know if our secret was blown.
Sam and I had already talked about it when we were prepping for takeoff. We’d go straight to the asteroid belt, warping into the outer edges of the system. We’d do some passive scanning before using the stealth systems to get closer. What we did next depended on what we found.
Accessing the ships training programs, I found some simulated scenarios we could carry out before we entered warp space. “Hey Sam, I think it would be prudent to test the limits of our fine new ship! There are a few combat scenarios we could do if you want.”
Sam grinned when I said that. “About time! I’ve been wanting to shoot something for almost a month now.”
I nodded before activating the simulators. Immediately the viewscreen blacked out. When it came back online, the entire situation had changed. In front of us was a frigate, appearing to be heading right for us. My nav backed up our sight, showing the ship as being twenty miles away. It would pass right over us in ten seconds.
A pulse of energy caused the lights to flicker. I saw a blue shield shimmer around the frigate before it vanished. The lights on the exterior of the frigate vanished as well, the EMP destroying its internal electronics.
A bright plume of orange plasma lanced out from our ship before impacting the frigate. I saw the ship start to melt, droplets of orange plasma and gray metal floating away. The frigate was completely gone, destroyed in a matter of seconds. The EMP cannon was just too awesome. Checking out the energy reserves though, I had some second thoughts. The simulator showed that we had just drained twenty two percent of our available energy with the EMP. Another four percent had disappeared along with the plasma burst. That cannon ate up energy like a monster.
The viewscreen turned black again before revealing empty space. The controls and energy reserves returned back to ninety eight percent. The last two percent was being used by the ion engine to navigate us to the warp boundary. The chemical thrusters were reserved for landing and leaving planets, or when extreme maneuvers were needed. Otherwise, the ion engines were sufficient for travel. Sure, they were weak and only provided a tenth of the thrust of chemical engines. Still, they were also cheap and ran off electricity. They didn’t need expensive fuel to keep running, unlike the chemical thrusters.
I pulled up several combat scenarios, allowing Sam to have his fill with the weaponry. I activated the stealth systems a couple times too. When I did that, all the lights dimmed as our energy signatures became muted. Exterior lights turned off all over the ship and the cowls for the engine deployed. Our speed dropped by half, but we were hidden from anyone that wasn’t directly behind us. 
Honestly, I was very impressed and delighted with the ship. Based on the combat scenarios, we could easily take out a battleship so long as it was by itself and it didn’t see us until we opened fire. If there were more ships, it would be a close call  and we wouldn’t get away unscathed. Most likely our shields would be severely drained from a single pas. Still, it was a vast improvement compared to just trying to fly away.
The other good thing was that the longer we flew, the more radiation was channeled into the EMP cannon. Thanks to that, it wouldn’t cost any energy to fire it in an initial salvo. The cannon hogged too much energy for my taste, though its effects couldn’t be argued with.
By the time we made it to the warp boundary, the ship had been run through its paces. I looked at Sam, doubts starting to run through my mind. “Should we do this? We don’t know what is waiting for us.”
Sam thought about it for a second before nodding. “Either no one is there, or they’ve taken over our mining operation. Whichever it is, we need to find out. You were the one that said the Federation could be destroyed if the Empire found the asteroid belt. It is our duty to protect the Federation, a duty I take seriously.”
When Sam said that, I felt relieved. Somehow, he had said exactly what I needed to hear. The anxiety I had been feeling was washed away by thinking of the oaths I had taken. I would protect the Federation from all threats, both foreign and domestic. “Thanks Sam, I needed that.”
He started grinning. “In that case, how about we rename the asteroid belt? Honestly, it’s weird that we haven’t named it anything by now.”
I chuckled. Typical Sam, cracking jokes whenever he could. He was serious when he needed to be, but he had lost some of his humor ever since the attack. I wasn’t the only one dealing with trauma apparently. He’d often take naps during our time at the base, a sign that the stress was getting to him. It had gotten better over the past week thought. “So, what name do you have in mind?”
Sam shrugged. “I don’t know, maybe the Nirvana System?”
Nirvana. The death and rebirth of creatures. “Nope, bad name choice.”
Sam looked miffed. “What? I thought about that for a long time man.”
“Dude, that is seriously a bad name. Think about it, we’re worried that the Empire would use the resources of the asteroid belt to build up a fleet that could destroy the Federation. Nirvana symbolizes death and rebirth. Do you really want that to mean the death of the Federation and rebirth of the Empire?”
Sam shivered at that. “Okay, I got you. Really bad omen there.” He adopted a contemplative look. “How about, Eden’s Belt?”
Eden, where humanity lost their innocence. I shrugged. He wasn’t going to stop and at least the name was somewhat reasonable. “Fine. Are you ready?”
“Yeah.”
With that, I activated the tachyon drive. 

***

We appeared from warp space outside Eden’s Belt. Our stealth systems were activate, the passive scanning system already engaged. There was nothing around us. I sighed in relief, letting out the tension that I didn’t know I had been holding in. “Alright, we’re in the system. Sam, do you mind directing the scan towards the mining settlement?”
The passive scanning system was composed of telescopes and radio receivers. Because they only received and didn’t emit anything, it would be impossible for us to be picked up. The active systems sent pulses of radio signals in order to find anything in the system. It was also a great way of announcing your presence.
Sam nodded before accessing the computer systems. After some time, Sam looked up at me, his face grim. “Tony. You’re not going to like this.”
My heart sank. “Let me see the scans.”
Sam turned the hologram around, letting me see the screen. On it was a massive meteorite. Thanks to the scale on the side of the image, I could see that it was close to twenty miles wide on the side we were facing. A huge hole was in the middle of the asteroid, glimpses of metal visible on the sides of the gaping chasm. Shuttles were flying from asteroids nearby into the giant hole. I knew what that was. It was a mobile shipyard. Presumably, the shuttles were bringing their hauls of ore to the shipyard for processing.
The Empire made shipyards like that by hollowing out the inside of giant asteroids, usually around eight to ten miles in diameter. They would fill the inside with machinery while keeping a mile thick sheet of rock around the shipyard as natural armor. The sheer thickness of the rock combined with the forcefields powered by the enormous reactors of the shipyard made it practically impervious to any weaponry. That wasn’t without mentioning the amount of armor that was put on the inside of the asteroid afterwards. 
The only way to destroy the mobile shipyard was to break through the forcefield and target the hole in the middle of the asteroid. Of course, most of the active defenses and turrets were around that hole as well. The chokepoint allowed for the shipyard to survive until a fleet could arrive to drive away the attackers. The mobile shipyard was even tougher than a dreadnought in terms of armor and shielding, though it didn’t have nearly as much firepower. The shipyards weren’t used to fight because while they were called mobile shipyards, they were anything but. They had tachyon drives that would get them into the proper system, while the fine placement was done by tugs. Such movement speed meant that they couldn’t be used against fleets and they would be crippled if the tugs were destroyed.
The fact that a mobile shipyard was here, in Eden’s Belt, could only mean one thing. The Empire was here. Not only that, but they were already using the vast resources of the belt to rebuild their fleet. This was literally the worst possible outcome.
I stood up, turning to stare out the viewport. I covered my mouth with my hand, the shame of what we had done overwhelming me. “Sam. Did we just hand over the Federation on a silver platter” I asked him, choking up on my emotions.
Sam came over, placing his hand on my shoulder. “Tony, you can’t think of that.”
I whirled towards him. He stepped backwards in shock at my violent outburst. “Sam! We were the ones that found this asteroid belt! We were the ones that decided to mine it! We were the ones that lead the Empire to Eden’s Belt!”
Sam sighed. “I know. I know we did. We didn’t know what was going to happen though.”
I nodded as I turned back towards the viewscreen. “It doesn’t excuse us though. All the deaths that are going to happen now, that’ll be on us. Maybe you don’t understand Sam. I was out there, on the front lines. I saw the horrors that war unleashed on the Galaxy while you stayed on the carrier.”
Sam slapped me on the back of head before glaring at me. “I may not have seen everything you did, but I still saw enough.”
I rubbed the spot on my head that was still smarting from his blow. “Sorry. That was uncalled for.”
Sam’s angry face softened as I spoke. “I don’t blame you. Just try and remember, we both lived through that nightmare.”
We stood there in silence for a few minutes. Sam finally spoke up. “I’ll go ahead and contact the Federation under your name. I’ll tell them that you have important information that needs to be relayed directly to the high-level staff.”
I nodded, still a bit numb at our discovery. No matter how I looked at it, this was our fault. That terrible war we had fought in, we had seen many horrors from it. 
I knew exactly what a planet looked like from space after it had been consumed in nuclear fire. I knew what a dead body looked like as it floated in zero gravity. I also knew what men said over the comms as they were about to die of oxygen deprivation. Their begging and pleading for help, the messages they asked us to record and send to their family members. The blackmail and betrayal as one tried to survive no matter what, even if it meant killing your friends.
I was still haunted by all the death and carnage I had seen, of the deaths of so many companions in that last battle. To think that I would be responsible for causing another war of that scale… It would be better for me to die than live with that thought. I looked at my hands as that thought crossed my mind. Better for me to die.
I shook my head to get rid of those thoughts. Death was a cowards way out. I needed to take responsibility for the horrors we had unleashed. 
I would fight the Empire with every breath I had in me. 
Maybe I would die.
But I would make sure that the Empire died with me.


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 15</h1>

It wasn’t an easy thing to setup a meeting with high ranking military officials, but the fact that I had previously been a Rear Vice Admiral helped Sam out a lot. Since the meeting was scheduled for two days later, we had the time to start gathering evidence from our ship and compiling it together. I was afraid of the consequences that would arise from our meeting, but I was prepared for the punishment.
We’d be admitting to discovering a resource that could have been used by the Federation and then hiding that information, using the resources we mined for our own personal good. We would also be admitting to crossing the border of explored space. Both crimes were very severe and could easily end up with a lifetime prison sentence. Still, I hoped the fact that we admitted to such crimes would highlight how severe this situation is.
At the end of the two days, both Sam and I were pleased with our argument. Landing at the military base that the meeting was to be held at, we exited our ship and were escorted to the conference room by a squad of marines. Inside the room were three Vice Admirals and an Admiral, all of them from the Navy. The Admiral’s name was Michael Obern, a veteran Admiral from the last galactic war. He had been in charge of that attack on the throneworld and he was also the one that pinned the star on my chest. While we hadn’t had any contact before the battle of Kaleesh, he had supported me and given me advice many times in the media frenzy afterwards. He was an ally, that much was certain.
When I walked into the room and saw the officers, I immediately saluted. Sam rolled his eyes and sat down. “At ease, Rear Vice Admiral Jones.” The Admiral’s deep bass voice resounded throughout the room. “While I appreciate the motion, you are a civilian now. There is no need to salute to me anymore, as your friend seems to have discovered. Please, have a seat.” General Obern motioned towards the seat by Sam. I winced, the mention of my real name and the lack of Sam’s decorum was hard to stomach. Victor Jones, the name and life that I had given up in order to be safe. Look how that turned out. It seemed as though trouble just wasn’t willing to let me go.
As I pondered about the unfairness of the universe, everyone else was ready to move on. Once I was seated, General Obern cleared his throat. “So Jones, what is it that you wanted to discuss with me?”
I held up my hand to stop him. “Call me Tony, General. As for the topic of today, it is most grievous. We have discovered the location of a mobile shipyard.”
The second they heard about the mobile shipyard, everyone tensed up. General Obern looked at me intensely, his eyes practically drilling a hole through my skull. “Tony, if this is another one of your deliriums, we need to settle this once and for all. You’ve made two false alarms about the Empire building another dreadnought, are you sure you want to go down this path?”
That was the one thing that I hadn’t been expecting. The accusation that I was crazy. During the war, I had constant nightmares. The last battle of the war was so bad that I hadn’t slept for over two weeks afterwards. I’d eventually been submitted to a psychiatric ward for three days before I was released, diagnosed with PTSD. The first two years had been horribly hard on me. Flying the cargo hauler had reminded me too much of being in a fighter. The only reason I had stuck by it was because the doctors said it would help me get over my trauma faster. It was ironic that it did the exact opposite, causing me to have a mental breakdown. 
I had become paranoid, convinced that an uncharted dwarf planet was the construction site of the Empire’s next dreadnought. I had made several calls to the navy about it, which prompted me to be re-submitted to the psychiatric ward. That time, I stayed for two months before I was released. Sam had stuck by me through the whole thing, refusing to leave me alone. It was one of the reasons we were such good friends, he’d been there when I had needed him the most. With the therapy that they gave me in the psychiatric ward, and the encouragement from Sam, I managed to pilot the Lone Wolf again. I hadn’t had any issues since then, but it still stung a little that the first thought  that Obern had, someone I considered to be an ally, was that I was insane.
While I was too stunned to say anything, Sam didn’t have any such qualms. “I guarantee, Admiral, that Tony is in perfect mental health when says this.” His voice had a hint of accusation in it.
I put my hand on his shoulder, attempting to express my thanks for the support and as a warning to not be too disrespectful. “What my friend says is true Admiral. I am of sound mind when I tell you that we have discovered the location of a mobile shipyard. Not only that, but we have also found the location of a significant portion of the remaining Imperial Armada.”
Admiral Obern sighed. “Tony, this is serious news. Tell me that you at least have proof.”
I nodded. “We have scans from our ship Lone Wolf, they’re passive scans but their contents are clear.” We had transferred the name from our destroyed cargo ship to our stealth corvette. I liked the name and it seemed fitting.
Sam handed the Admiral a tablet with copies of our scans. He flipped through the screens, his face gravely serious. He handed it over to one of the vice admirals after viewing it. “What do you think, Vice Admiral Royce.”
The Vice Admiral glanced through the scans, the same serious expression on his face. “I believe that this is enough proof to regard them seriously. Of course, I would like to access their ship’s records directly. If it checks out, then I say we send a scout ship to the system before making any other plans.” He was still checking out the scans when e paused. He looked up at us, is eyebrow raised. “Actually, I do have one question for you. Why, exactly, are the coordinates beyond the frontier?”
Sam chuckled nervously. “Ahem.” I cleared my throat. “Well, you see, it’s in a system beyond the border.”
Admiral Obern glared at me. “I know that from the coordinates. How about you tell me why you were beyond the border to begin with.”
“A while back, we were attacked by pirates. We were close to the warp boundary, so my navigator, Sam, put in the coordinates hoping we could jump in time. Due to his haste, the coordinates were typed in wrong. They were instead the coordinates that you see there. At the coordinates we found…”
I described the strange circumstances that lead to our discovery of Eden’s Belt. I told the Admiral about our decision to mine the belt and the reasons why. I told him about the attacks we had suffered and our decision to request for protective custody. I then told him of our decision to return to the asteroid belt in our stealth corvette, only to find that the Empire was already there. The entire time I was talking, Admiral Obern was staring into my eyes. When I finished talking, everyone remained quiet.
The silence was killing me. Finally, Admiral Obern stood up. He approached the door of the conference room and knocked. One of the marines outside opened the door. Admiral Obern turned towards me. “The information you have provided is of critical importance to the Federation. While I thank both of you for what you have done, it does not excuse the crimes that you have committed.” He turned to the marine standing at attention next to him. “Take these two and place them in the brig. Treat them with respect, but keep them confined.”
He turned back to us. “Until I can discuss this with the Fleet Admiral, you shall remain in custody. I believe you are a valiant man, Victor. I shall try and convince the Fleet Admiral to be lenient. Still, I am sorely disappointed in some of the decisions you have made.”
I nodded glumly as we were lead away by the marine. Ten minutes later, Sam and I were in the brig. The force field hummed as it went active. Sam turned to me and chuckled. “What Sam, what’s so funny?” I snapped. I was feeling pretty bad right about now.
“Oh nothing.” Sam said as he waved his hand in dismissal. He chuckled again. “You know that saying in the navy? I believe it was ‘let us get what we want and let karma never catch up.’ I was just thinking about how much karma we just reaped.”
I glared at Sam which caused him to start laughing again. His chuckles turned into full blown laughter the longer I glared. I tried to be serious, but my mask was already starting to crack. I couldn’t help it as I dissolved into laughter myself.
By the time we stopped, I was on the floor. As I stared up at the ceiling, I couldn’t help but wonder. Just what was going to happen to us now?


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 16</h1>

Admiral Obern turned to the three Vice Admirals after Rear Vice Admiral Jones was escorted out of the room. “What are your opinions of this information?”
Vice Admiral Steinberg was the first to speak out. “I don’t trust them. One has PTSD and has already blown a false alarm once. The other is too disrespectful. Sensor scans are easy to fake and I’m inclined to believe that he would fake it jst to get a few laughs from us running around like a chicken with its head cut off.” 
Vice Admiral Royce spoke up afterwards. “I believe that we should send a scout to verify the information.” He glanced at the door. “While I also distrust our sources, the fact that they were willing to admit to such a capital crime means that they have something to prove. Sending a scout ship doesn’t cost us anything but fuel and time. If this… Eden’s belt, is as resource loaded as they say, we are in serious danger.”
Everyone around the table nodded at what Steinberg said. Admiral Obern turned to the last Vice Admiral. “Vice Admiral Pryor, what is your opinion of this matter.”
The man in question simply shrugged. “The source is unreliable, but they brought proof. We can’t afford to ignore the possible danger and it won’t cost us anything at all. I say we send the scout ship and see where that takes us.”
Admiral Obern nodded at is conclusion before glancing around the table. “So, we are all agreed on sending a scout ship to Eden’s Belt?” Everyone around the table nodded. “Good. I shall contact the Fleet Admiral and get his opinion as well. In the meantime, this information is classified and will not leave this room.”
Once it was agreed upon, Admiral Obern dismissed all of the Vice Admirals. He accessed the computer and requested a holo-chat with the Fleet Admiral.
It took about ten minutes for Fleet Admiral Roth to clear his schedule to hear out Admiral Obern. The arrival of Fleet Admiral Roth was announced by the flickering of lights before his shimmering image appeared in a chair before Admiral Ober. “Admiral Obern, I was told by my secretary that this was a matter of grievous importance.”
Admiral Obern saluted. “Yes sir, it is. I apologize if this is keeping you from other important matters.” 
Roth waved his hand in dismissal. “It’s fine. The only thing I was busy with was meeting with the council about the pirates again. They understand the situation with the Empire, but they are worried that the public is being swayed by the media. We may no longer have the support of the council in our secret endeavors if we don’t handle that blasted Admiral Belthos soon. If we lose our political support, we will lose all the money we need to build new ships. We won’t be able to eliminate those god-forsaken guerilla tactics of Admiral Blthos.”
Admiral Obern nodded in acknowledgement of their mutual dilema. “In that regard, sir, we may have had a fortunate breakthrough. Though retired, Rear Vice Admiral Jones and Lieutenant Forzit have discovered the location of a mobile shipyard along with the majority of Admiral Belthos’ fleet.”
Roth raised his eyebrows. “Oh? Tell me more of this discovery.”
Admiral Obern proceeded to tell Fleet Admiral Roth of their discovery and the circumstances behind it, along with the Vice Admirals’ opinions on what to do. When he got to their trespassing of the border, he mentioned that they were currently in the brig. That made Roth seem a little disappointed but he let Admiral Obern continue with his explanation. At the end of it, Roth leaned back in his chair.
“This is certainly a quandry. I agree that sending a scout ship is the best course of as far as military action is concerned. Now, those men that discovered Eden’s Belt are the real problem.  On one hand, they’ve broken more than a few laws, all of which are capital offenses. On the other hand, they’ve provided a great service to their country by giving us this news, even if they ended up in jail.” Fleet Admiral Roth rubbed his head. “What a headache.”
“Sir, if I may speak?” Admiral Obern asked hesitantly. When Roth indicated he could go on, Admiral Obern gathered his thoughts before continuing. 
“I know Jones from the battle of Kaleesh. He is a wonderful pilot and very dedicated to the service. If it hadn’t been for his PTSD, I am sure that he would have remained in the service. As it is, he can’t pilot a fighter without having a panic attack. Even getting on a shuttle can trigger him. It’s only when he is controlling bigger ships, such as the cargo ship or the corvette he owns, that he is able to deal with his fears. I heard his reasons for not telling us of his discovery and I understand them. I don’t agree with what he did and I am ashamed that he would mine Eden’s Belt for his own personal gain. Still, I believe he is a man of great courage to be able to give up his freedom to provide use with this critical information.”
Fleet Admiral Roth frowned. “What about Lieutenant Forzit? I don’t remember you mentioning him in your little monologue.”
Admiral Obern sighed. “Though Forzit and Jones are very good friends, I haven’t had much contact with Forzit. The only thing I can say is that if Forzit could stick by Jones despite his mental troubles, he is just as great a man as Jones himself. His attitude, however, leaves much room for improvement.”
Roth nodded. “I see. So you admire both of these men then? What exactly is it that you wish for me to do?”
“I would simply like for you to see what they were willing to do for their country. The crossing of the border was accidental, so I don’t see that as a crime. Mining the asteroid was selfish of them, yes, but they had good reason for not telling us. Please, put in a good word for them if they are to be sentenced. Try and get them as light a sentence as possible in light of their circumstances and merits.”
“I see.” Roth leaned back in his chair to ponder this request but for a moment before nodding. “I agree. I’ll personally tell whatever judge they are assigned of these matters and request they be lenient. I must warn you though.” He looked at Admiral Obern sternly. “If they were lying about the Imperial Armada, and this is just another of Rear Vice Admiral Jones mental episodes, then I will have him sent to a psychiatric ward until he is better and then both the Lieutenant and Rear Vice Admiral will be sent to jail on a lifelong sentence.”
Admiral Obern nodded. “Thank you for your understanding sir. For what it’s worth, I don’t believe they are lying sir. I haven’t seen such fire in Jones since the battle for Kaleesh. He believes he is right with every fiber of his being, Lieutenant Forzit also supports him as well.”
Fleet Admiral Roth nodded. “Let us all hope that your belief in this report is not misplaced. I am afraid that if this stalemate go on for much longer, we will lose the support of the public and of the politicians. Without their money and support, we will lose to the Empire eventually.”

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 17</h1>

A black 30 by 30 ft cube of metal appeared outside Edn’s Belt. The radiation from warp space was absorbed by its shields, its arrival concealed from anyone that would attempt to see it. Telescopes and radio arrays swiveled on the outside of the cube, pointing themselves deeper into the system. Its mainframe took multiple scans of the system, making sure to cover every square mile of space.
The black cube was the Federations scout ship, a drone sent to scout dangerous systems completely undetected. Without having to maintain gravity, air, and heat, the scout ship was even stealthier compared to a real stealth corvette. Once it was finished scanning this section, the drone activated its tachyon drive, jumping to a different portion of the systems Oort cloud in order to get a more thorough scan. It jumped a total of 17 times before it was finished. 
Once it was done with its scans, the scout ship jumped back to the Federation base that had sent it. The base downloaded the scout ship’s scans before sending it back through an encrypted channel. While some of the base’s personnel wanted to view the information, they didn’t have high enough clearance to see it. The mission the drone was sent on was top secret. Only the highest brass was authorized to see it.

***

Seventeen hours after his conversation with Admiral Obern, Fleet Admiral Roth received a message from a Federation base. The contents of the message was a 3D rendering of Eden’s Belt. Fleet Admiral Roth sighed sadly when he received it. Just like Admiral Obern had hoped, the remnants of the Imperial Armada were indeed in Eden’s belt. Still, this was going to be a headache.
Discovering the location of Admiral Belthos fleet was undoubtedly good news, especially since they would be able to stop Belthos before he could rebuild his fleet.  This was going to start a firestorm politically for sure though. The questions of ‘should we fight them’ or ‘what are the costs’ were going to be a major headache. First things first, he went ahead and called he President.
After some explanations of what was going on, the President gave him an answer. Until this crisis was dealt with, he was given permission by the President to mobilize all military assets. This carte blanche order was music to his ears. WIth the President’s seal, he would be able to skip all the political hogwash right away. Once he was off the comms with the President, he immediately issued emergency orders.
One way or another, he would take Admiral Belthos down.

***

Admiral Obern slumped in his chair. At least he didn’t have to worry about Victor anymore. Still, he wasn’t looking forward to the upcoming fight. Death was something that no one should look forward too. Maybe Admiral Belthos would surrender? He shook his head to clear it of such fanciful thoughts.
Well, at least he would have something good to look forward too. He called the base that was currently holding Rear Vice Admiral Jones and Lieutenant Forzit. It was funny that while Jones had taken up the offer of a fake identity, eventually becoming Tony Delgado, Forzit had refused. The only thing that he had agreed upon was changing his first name from Chase to Sam. Still, that was his choice.
Once he got ahold of the base, he asked for Victor Jones to be put on the comms. While he waited, he reminisced about his first meeting with Jones. At the time, the man had come into his office with the other fighter squadron leaders. He’d meet with them in order to emphasize how important their role would be in destroying the dreadnoughts. Jones had stood out to him, his attitude and confidence that he could carry out what seemed like a suicidal mission made Obern take note of him. That confidence was the mark of an officer. Depending on if he survived and his military merits, Obern was planning on promoting him.
The second time he met Jones, all he saw was the shell of the man that used to be him. Unfortunately, because of short supply of surviving pilots, Jones was ordered to fly relief shuttles to carry out rescue operations on Federation and Empire ships that had been damaged or destroyed. The horrors of what he saw, combined with the deaths of his squadron, had scarred him so deep down that he couldn’t recover. It was one thing to brag about destroying a ship. It was another thing entirely to see the dead and wounded be carried off that same ship. 
He had a son the same age as Jones. Thank god his son had wanted to be an accountant instead of going into the military. When he saw the broken state Jones was in, it tore him up inside. He couldn’t help but think ‘that could’ve been my son.’
After that meeting, he’d made it his mission to help Jones as much as he could. He’d tried to act distant though, not letting Jones know how he truly felt. Jones was still thankful for his help navigating the media and politics from the fight. Whenever he could, Admiral Obern would approve of anything that Jones wanted.
It was all small things, such as getting plastic surgery from military health insurance, or allowing him to possess military weapons for protection. He’d even approved of Forzit and Jones keeping their military issued space suits. It bothered him greatly that he’d had to throw them in the brig.
Still, that wasn’t his fault. He wasn’t given a choice when they admitted to committing a capital offense in front of three other officers. Maybe if they had only told him, then he could have worked something out. At least he would be able to help them now, since Fleet Admiral Roth was going to give them a good word for their trial.
The holoscreen in front of him turned into an image of Jones face. Admiral Obern straightened up, his face automatically turning into the serious mask he’d always used in front of Jones. There honestly wasn’t much to say. He informed Jones that the scout ship backed up his claim and that Roth would be supporting them when they went to court. Jones thanked him and wished him luck in the upcoming fight.
Admiral Obern thanked him in return before hanging up. He shook his head sadly after the holoscreen disappeared. War was a terrible thing, and Jones was just one of the many casualties. He called one of his lawyers and started to consult with them about ways to get out of prison scot free. Maybe there was a way he could still help them.

Federation ships across the galaxy started to mobilize. Ship leave was canceled and crews were hastily brought back on board. Captains started to cut lines, prioritizing their refueling and rearming over civilian ships. Thousands of ships started to warp to their coordinates. 
Within twenty three hours, all of the ships that Fleet Admiral Roth had ordered were at the meeting area in deep space. Roth ordered Admiral Obern to take over control of the fleet. While he could do it himself, his job was to coordinate between the three fleets of the Federation, not to take command of one himself. The other two fleets were now spread extremely thin in order to protect the Federation.
Admiral Obern transmitted orders that they were going to be attacking an Imperial Fleet that they outnumbered only slightly. Many of the captains were veterans of the last galactic war and took their orders in a stride. The handful of rookie captains were all nervous. Still, they were ready to do their duty. Within the fleet, several messages were transmitted. While their messages varied slightly, they all said practically the same thing. ‘The Federation is attacking the shipyard.’
Once their orders were received, Admiral Obern gave them ten minutes before warping out. Their armada disappeared, ripples of radiation from entering warp space the only proof that they were there.

***

The officer stood in front of Admiral Belthos, giving his .“Sir, the news reports of the Federation are showing that many planets are now missing their patrol ships. The media is speculating on an unannounced training maneuvers in the fleet. Combined with our spies reports, we can conclude that the Federation has discovered our operation here and are currently mustering a fleet to attack us.”
Belthos took the news calmly. “Good work Lieutenant.” He’d known that the Federation would find them eventually. No man was an island and that held doubly true for a faction. While the asteroid field was rich in various elements, some rare earth elements were not available in the system. One such element was Neodymium, the powerful magnet that was a crucial component in shielding. Another thing that was lacking was fuel for the tachyon drives.
Transporting large amounts of sensitive materials such as these would undoubtedly draw the attention of the Federation. Still, it was much too early for the Federation to find out about them. They had most of the materials needed to rebuild the Empire. All they needed now was time.
Admiral Belthos nodded decisively. “Lieutenant, order the fleet to jump to shadow planet Wolfen whenever their individual ships are ready.” That was the planet all his assets were located to begin with. “Also, tell Vice Admiral Shen I wish to speak with him.” The Lieutenant nodded and left the room.
He swiveled his chair to face a map of the galaxy. With a gesture from his hand, one of the planets on the border turned from red to blue as several purple spots moved around the planet.
It was time to give in to his advisors.
The Empire was going to announce their comeback with the biggest splash he could come up with.
The Federation wouldn’t know what hit them.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 18</h1>

The Federation fleet emerged next to the coordinates of the mobile shipyard. Everyone was at their combat stations, ready to spring into action. Many a man had already said their prayers, getting ready for the worst case scenario.
The second they left hyperspace, the fighters launched from their bays. Active scanners sent out radio signals and turrets started to spray out bolts of star-hot plasma. Then, the combat map updated. All around them were asteroids. No ships, no traps. There was nothing there to suggest that the system was previously a base for the Empire.
Admiral Obern was suspicious that this was the wrong location. Double checking the coordinates revealed that this was, indeed, the correct spot. Close scans of the surrounding asteroids revealed signs of large-scale mining operations. When Admiral Obern heard the news, he destroyed a table in anger. This had been exactly what he’d feared. They couldn’t resist attempting to take out the Empire, but it was a gamble. If they could arrive in the system before they jumped, they may have won. It was too bad that the Empire had been able to move the mobile shipyard before they could arrive though.
Admiral Obern frowned. If the Imperial Armada wasn’t here, where had they gone?

“Captain on deck!” The aide announced to the bridge while saluting. Everyone stood up and saluted.
Anna waved her hand. “At ease. Sensors, tell me the situation.” 
The sensors officer remained standing to give the report while everyone else sat down. “Everything is nominal mam, nothing new to report.” 
“Good.” With one last salute, her first mate left the bridge, ready to get some sleep. On her mission to prove that the pirates were actually Imperials in disguise, her destroyer was sent to practically every corner of the frontier. Currently they were in the Veltrus system, setting off after some R&R at the lunar station. Since they didn’t have any leads on recent pirate activity, Centurion was helping out with patrols in the local area.
She sat down in the captain’s chair, getting ready for the long patrol. She’d have to stay on the bridge for her watch duty, a total of 8 hours. Everything seemed to be be going according to routine. It wasn’t until the beginning of the fourth hour that everything went wrong.
“Captain! I have multiple ships dropping out of orbit! So far, I count over thirty Battleship class ships! They’re of Imperial make!” The frantic voice of her sensors officer caused everyone on the ship to straighten up.
Anna was shocked at this turn of events, but she still instinctively activated the ship comms. “Attention all, we are under attack! Get to your stations and prepare for combat!” The loud speaker started emitting the sound of a horn. There were 3 short blasts, one long, and then 3 short blasts again. That was the signal for combat. Automated programs caused the seat restraints to strap Anna and the bridge crew into their seats. If the inertia dampeners cut off, they needed to be ready for acceleration.
“Navigation, give me a heading of the ships! Comms, start hailing them! Hopefully they’re not here for a fight. This is a civilian system, there isn’t any military assets for them to attack. Make sure that you also send a distress signal to the Federation, let them know what we’re dealing with here.”
Her officers started to get to work. “Sir, I have a live communication line with the oncoming fleet,” Her communications officer said.
At the same time, a holomap with the heading of the ships appeared in front of her. They were heading for Getral, the gas giant in the system where most of the fuel was gathered. The other Navy assets in the area were on the screen but it wasn’t enough. There was a small contingent of corvettes, some armed frigates, two wings of fighters, and one cruiser. They wouldn’t last two minutes.
“Put them on screen.” The communication officer nodded before tapping something on her screen. A visual of an imperial bridge appeared before her.
A large man was sitting on his own chair. “This is Commander Tibit of the Empire. We will be seizing this systems reserve of hyperspace fuel for the glory of the Empire. Power down your ship or be destroyed.”
“Not until we know you aren’t going to be attacking the civilians.”
Commander Tibit rolled his eyes. “Of course we won’t attack the civilians. What benefit would we get from such a pointless waste of ammunition? Though I am not above destroying a city or two if they refuse to give us the fuel we desire.”
Anna let out a sigh. “Destroyer Centurion of the Federation Navy is now powering down.”
She motioned for communications to cut the feed. “Send a message to all the Navy assets recommending them to power down. We couldn’t make a dent in that fleet if we tried all day. If he wanted to kill us he wouldn’t let us power down, so we’re probably safe. Message the entire system to let them know we are under attack and to surrender. If no one attacks them and they give up anything they ask, I don’t believe any blood will be shed.”
She turned towards the other bridge crew. “Go ahead and power down the shields and weapons. Continue monitoring the ships with passive scans until they leave the system.” She activated the shipwide comms. “Everyone, remain at your battle stations, but do not engage unless I command it.”
“Sir,” the communications officer said. “The Navy just contacted us. They said to surrender and advise the civilian population to give in to any demands they have. They’re sending a large fleet now, but they don’t expect to make it before this fleet jumps.”
Anna nodded before staring out the viewport. “All we can do now is wait and pray.”

Sebastian ran down the stairs taking two at a time. Jacob and Liam were right behind him. “Sebastian! Where are you going!” Jacob yelled after him, attempting to be heard above the sirens. The loudspeakers were on telling everyone to take shelter inside their homes while the defense force would take care of the invasion.
“My dad is on duty! I gotta find him!” Sebastian yelled back. His father, the ex-marine, was part of the station’s security detail.
Jacob and Liam didn’t say anything after that, they simply kept running behind him. Sebastian slammed open the door on the stairwell, running down the metal corridor. After a few blocks he arrived at the station security office. Throwing the door open, Seastian rushed in with Jacob and Liam hot on his heels. “Dad!” he yelled out.
There was a great deal of men inside the security station, all of them armed with guns. They were strapping on armored suits while double checking their ammunition. One of them turned towards Sebastian, a stunned look on his face. “Sebastian, what are you doing here?!” He asked angrily.
Sebastian shrugged. “I’m not sure. I just wanted to make sure you were safe.”
“Sergeant, what are these kids doing here?” One of the men turned to Sebastian’s dad, authority exuding from his figure.
“I don’t know Master Sergeant, they just ran in here.”
The Master Sergeant eyed them before gesturing towards them. “Come here, we’ll put you somewhere safe. Sergeant, you go ahead and watch them for now, make sure they don’t get in any trouble. From what the Navy is saying, they only want supplies. If we give them the hyperspace fuel, we should be safe”
Sebastian’s dad nodded gratefully. “Thank you Master Sergeant. I’ll watch over them.”
The Master Sergeant nodded grimly. “You better. If one of those Imperial scum gets hurt, we’ll all pay for it. Even if it was just some stupid kids.”

***

The captain of the Imperial destroyer watched as the last of the frigates loaded with hyperspace fuel took off from the moon. What a pitiful little thing. It wasn’t even a real planet, yet it housed so many lives. It wouldn’t be that way for lng. “Weapons, prepare to fire.”
“Yes Sir!”
As the officer busied himself with prepping the missiles, the captain reviewed his orders. One of the advisors of Admiral Obern himself had given it to him. If he carried this mission out correctly, maybe it would mean a promotion? While rank held little meaning as of now, when they conquered the Federation it would mean so much more.
“The missiles are ready sir.”
The Captain glanced at the targeting information to ensure it was correct. “Good. Fire on my mark. 3...2...1...Fire!”
There was a brief shudder as the recoil from the missiles’ intense acceleration washed over the battleship. Tracking information appeared before him, the missiles trajectories being updated in real time.
Commander Tibit’s image appeared on his bridge less than twenty seconds later. The missiles were already a quarter of the way there. There was no stopping it now. “Captain Olt, I demand an explanation right now! Why did you just fire twenty nuclear missiles at civilian targets! What is your goal!”
Captain Olt shrugged. “I’m not quite sure. I was told by advisor Reynolds that Admiral Obern wanted the civilian population of this system wiped out along with any Federation assets. He said that he wanted to make a grand statement that the Empire was back.”
Commander Tibit was still livid though. “I wasn’t made aware of such a demand! Advisor Reynolds does not command this fleet and I expect you to remember that!”
Captain Olt glanced outside the ship. On the moon below, several lunar stations were already replaced with mushroom clouds. “Commander Tibit, are you still going to carry out advisor Reynolds suggestion?”
Commander Tibit threw up his hands. “Why not. I mean, destroying a few Federation ships is nothing compared to what you just did. Might as well.” He turned towards his bridge crew. “Order the Federation ships to be destroyed. Fire on anything living in the system, civilian or military.”

***
Sebastian, Jacob, and Liam all sat in the interrogation room. The seats weren’t comfortable and they were pinching their thighs. Liam, the tall black man, seemed especially uncomfortable. Sebastian’s dad had left the room a while ago, the Master Sergeant asking him to check something out.
The door flew open, banging against the wall. The sudden noise and movement caused Jacob and Sebastian to jump. In the doorway stood Sebastian’s dad. Tears streamed down his face. He ran over and hugged Sebastian. “I’m sorry son, I’m sorry,” he sobbed into Sebastian’s ear.
Sebastian stood there in shock for a second before he tried pulling away. “Dad, let go! What’s wrong dad!”
His dad shook his head, his grip tightening. “They launched nukes Sebastian. They launched nukes.”
Jacob, Sebastian, and Liam tried to process this statement. Before they could, there was a flash of bright light and the brief sensation of searing heat.
Then, there was nothing.

***

Anna stared at the screen in shock. “Is this real?” She whispered.
The sensors officer nodded silently. “Dear God,” she exclaimed. The light of nuclear fire burning on the surface of Getral’s moon reflected in her eyes. Warning klaxons quickly brought her out of shock. “One of the battleships is heading for us captain! They have us caught in a disruptor field! We can’t jump!”
Anna started barking out orders. “Power up the shields, full power to engines! Divert any power you can from the weapons, we won’t need them for now. Head in the opposite direction of the battleship, they’re slower than us and we can outrun them. Don’t forget to try and dodge any attacks heading towards us. Send a message to HQ informing them that the Empire has used nuclear bombs in the system. They’re attacking civilians.”
The bridge became a flurry of activity as the crew started to carry out her orders. Everything shook as something hit them. “Captain! The battleship has fired lasers! Our shields still need time to power up!”
There was the sound of an explosion as the ship shook again. “We just lost one of our engines!”
A different officer yelled out, their voice filled with hope. “The shields just came online!”
Multiple lasers hit the shield. The navigation officer yelled out. “They just fired a barrage from their plasma cannons! Evasive actions, everyone brace!”
On the viewscreen, Anna saw over twenty large, orange balls of plasma getting closer to their ship. Each one was the size of corvette! It was the main armament of a battleship. Firing their own plasma turrets would only make the plasma balls get bigger. They had some other point defense systems, but they were just as useless.
Their only hope was to dodge some of them and hope the shields could handle the rest. The barrage got closer and closer, the plasma balls following the ionized trail of their thrust. They tried to frantically shake them off, but the plasma balls just got closer.
Everyone knew that with one engine out of commission, it was impossible to outrun such a large barrage. Still, no one suggested they stop running. So far, not even one plasma ball had lost track of their ion trail.  ‘I’m not going down without a fight!’ Anna thought savagely. “Fire all available missiles, target that battleship!”
Anna was close to blacking out from all the maneuvers, the g-force managing to partially bleed through the inertia dampeners. Despite her blurry vision, she could still see the screen. She watched as the missiles they were able to fire were swatted down like flies before they could reach the battleship. A couple lasers that someone fired without her permission caused the battleship’s shield to flare briefly, but the lasers weren’t able to penetrate it. ‘Even revenge is denied,’ she thought bitterly.
She watched in horror as several of the plasma balls started to burn through their shields, causing even more warning klaxons going off. ‘If only they didn’t have that disruptor field. If only our shields hadn’t been down. Then, maybe we could have survived.’
The plasma balls burned completely through the shields. Then, they went through the hull of the ship. The star-hot plasma melted through the metal like a hot knife through butter. 
The plasma balls continued off into the distance. Some of them spluttered out, losing their magnetic containment. Those plasma balls scattered, droplets of the plasma splattering outwards. The other plasma balls would also lose their containment eventually, their cohesive shape dissolving into messy splatters.
The Centurion was gone. The only thing that remained was molten metal and the ashes of the fallen.


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 19</h1>

Admiral Belthos heard the doors open up behind him. Rising to his feet, he turned to see his advisor handcuffed and escorted by two marines with their guns drawn. “Reynolds, you have much to explain,” he said in a quiet voice. The malice contained within was obvious to any that heard it.
Reynolds puffed up his chest when he heard his name. “How dare you Admiral Belthos! You have no right to order my arrest, release me this instant!”
“No right? It is YOU! “ Admiral Belthos shouted, his face turning red with rage. “YOU, Advisor Reynolds, that has NO RIGHT!” Admiral Belthos stared down at the man as Reynolds shrunk back in fear. 
This advisor was one of the officials of the Empire, an administrator that the Emperor had placed on his ship to ensure his loyalty. When the Emperor was killed, Reynolds had voluntarily relinquished most of his control and instead taken up the post of ‘military advisor.’ Reynolds and several other members of the previous administration staff would meet with Admiral Belthos in order to discuss matters of the fleet. They had been helpful many times when it came to logistics, so Admiral Belthos was willing to put up with them. This, though, was crossing line.
“How DARE you Reynolds! You ordered one of MY captains to fire on a civilian outpost! With nukes too! This raid was supposed to undermine the authority of the Federation and make their Navy look weak! The Empire was supposed to be seen as people that are desperate and on the run, something that our spies in the media can spin to our advantage! Now, we’re seen as the next Hitler! The eradicators of entire planets even when they don’t put up a fight!”
The defiant expression that Reynolds had when he entered the room withered and died. “I-I-I.” He stammered for a couple seconds before gulping. “I just wanted to make the Empire look strong again. I was tired of us looking so weak. I thought that by nuking that planet, then the ruthless Empire would make its comeback.”
Admiral Belthos sighed before sitting down in his chair again. “The ‘ruthless Empire’ would have had its day in the sun. It is simply the wrong timing for it to come out now. Since you forced my hand, we’ll play off your little stunt as a threat to the Federation. I’m simply afraid that this will sway the political situation in the Federation towards the military.” He sighed again before looking at Reynolds. “I do have to thank you though. One of the Federation ships that was destroyed included the Centurion. I’m sure you already know why I am happy about that.”
Reynolds nodded several times. “Yes, yes of course! They are the ones that killed your brother, a truly fortunate happenstance.”
Admiral Belthos smiled. “Fortunate for me, but not for you. You see, I can’t let you get away with what you did, despite the present you gave me. Both you and the Captain you ordered will be executed publicly for inciting rebellion against the Empire. Consider yourself lucky that it will be quick. Guards, take him away.”
Reynolds collapsed to the ground in shock. He attempted to say something as he was dragged away, but only babbling came out. Admiral Belthos let out a dark chuckle as the door closed. At least he wasn’t going to have to make up false charges. This scenario wasn’t supposed to happen for at least half a year, but it seemed that his plans were always being set in motion long before they were supposed to occur.

***

When Admiral Obern’s fleet arrived at Veltrus, they discovered the horrible tragedy that had occurred. The media found out afterwards and had a heyday broadcasting the images, though they had differing opinions. 
Some of the news channels thought that the tragedy occured because the Navy was incompetent. Others thought that there was nothing the Navy could have done due to the nature of the attack. Still others believed it was a conspiracy and the Veltrus was just cut off from the rest of the galaxy so that experiments could be performed on the population. Practically everyone ignored that last opinion. There was a lot of finger pointing and blame on the politicians as well, with many different politicians defending themselves and throwing their two cents in.
What everyone could agree on though, was that the Empire was just as cruel as it had always been. A video of Admiral Belthos threatening the Federation with war if they continued looking for him caused even more controversy. After a poll was taken, over seventy-nine percent of the population wanted the Federation to leave the Empire alone. Thirteen percent believed that the Empire would attack anyways and it would be best to destroy them now. Another two percent were conflicted and the last six percent refused to take sides.
If one had to sum up the media situation currently, there would only be one word for it. Chaos.

***

Fleet Admiral Roth was lost for words. Never in his worst nightmare did he imagine their attempt to fight the Empire would result in this. He didn’t even know how to react. His phone was ringing constantly as members of the press and government tried to reach him, but he had his secretary ignore all the calls.
Currently he was in his office, a bottle of wine sitting on his desk. He hadn’t opened it yet. He didn’t deserve the relief it would bring. A knock on the door caused him to finally get up from his chair.
Opening the door, he came face to face with the Speaker of the House, Evan Ingleman. “Can I come in, Fleet Admiral Roth?”
Admiral Roth nodded. “Sure. Just call me Admiral Roth though, Fleet Admiral is just too wordy sometimes.”
Evan walked into the office and sat down on one of hsi chairs. Admiral Roth went ahead and opened the wine bottle, pouring a glass for both of them. He passed the cup to Evan, but he pushed it out of the way. “Admiral Roth, I didn’t come here to have a drink with you. I came here to-.”
“Fire me, I know.” Admiral Roth sat down in his chair, taking a sip as he did so. “I’m aware that the fiasco in Veltrus is a huge public relations scandal. Someone has to take the fall for it and I’ve already prepared the papers. I can resign within ten minutes, unless you would like me to do it at a different time.”
Evan’s shook his head. “Admiral Roth, you can’t seriously think that Congress and the House are both stupid. We know that you couldn’t have done anything to prevent that attack. You arrived within system less than an hour after they Empire nuked the system, a response time of three hours. When we measure distance with light years, that is quite an achievement.”
Admiral Roth raised an eyebrow. “Than what, exactly, are you here to do?”
Evan took out a folder and passed it across the table. “I believe that this was a budget proposal you gave us half a year ago. While we were reluctant due to the costs, we had an emergency meeting that just disbanded ten minutes ago. The president has already approved and the funds are being transferred. Project Behemoth is now approved.”
Admiral Roth took a moment to process exactly what Evan had said. When he did, he stood up and held out his hand. “Evan, you may not quite understand what you have just approved of. Let me tell you this, the reason for our short response time was that we had a fleet already in the area that was attempting to destroy an Imperial operation site. The Empire has spies in our fleet and they were warned away before we could attack. This project will change all that.”
Evan grasped Roth’s hands firmly. “I am very much aware of what this will do. We have our own military advisors remember. The President was the one that implemented the Emergency Meeting and he was the one that explained why this project would work, along with what you had been attempting to do with that fleet of yours. If you have anyone to thank, it should be him.”

Shipton Incorporated, a civilian construction company, received a large order from a unanimous buyer. Over 3000 tons of Crysteel were to be manufactured into armor plating. Another company received an order for hundreds of high-end electronic parts. A shipyard started making large plasma turrets and laser cannons. Raw material was shipped to several navy construction yards to start building railguns, plasma cannons, and EMP cannons. Missiles started being shipped by the ton. Sensitive and secret projects started creating their high-tech weaponry.
All of it was sent to an undisclosed location where a giant ship was being worked on. It’s massive size was uncontested, a marvel to human engineering and science. 
Soon, Project Behemoth would be complete.
Soon, the fleet killer would be unleashed on the Empire.


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 20</h1>

I received the news with shock. The Veltrus system was gone, destroyed in nuclear fire. There were many thoughts that swirled through my head, all of them about how I was responsible. Tears ran down my face as different people I remembered from the station flashed through my mind. The old tour guide Steven, Sebastian and Jacob bickering, the silent Liam, the dockworkers, the waiter, and even the hotel staff. Everyone I came into contact with was gone. Sam was right there with me and he wasn’t in any better shape. The guard that had delivered the news waited for me to stop sobbing before telling me something else. “The destroyer Centurion was in the system as well. We believe that it was destroyed.”
The news hit me like a punch in the gut. I collapsed to the ground sobbing, Sam joining me. We hugged on the ground, finding support in each other. There wasn’t a word to describe what I felt. So many people died. Some that I knew briefly and others that I had gone through the fires of hell and back again for. And their deaths could be traced directly back to me. I knew I was being too selfish, since Sam was dealing with the same thing. Yet, I couldn’t help but focus on me. It just hurt so much, this pain inside.
I don’t know how long I cried, but I had passed out some time. I woke up when Sam removed my arm from his shoulder. The tears had long since dried and my eyes felt itchy and sore from crying. The guard had left while I was passed out. Where the guard had been sitting was  Admiral Obern.
I wiped my eyes instinctively trying to get rid of the tears that had previously been there but all that was left was this nasty, crusty stuff. Admiral Obern shrugged as he saw my attempt. “That isn’t going to work sonny. You’re going to need a wash to get rid of that junk.”
Sam picked himself off the floor. “I’m gonna let you two talk it out. For some reason, I don't think you came to talk to me.” His voice was raspy from the crying. He walked out of the room, heading towards the kitchen. I heard the fridge door open shortly and clinking sounds as he started to rummage through it.
I tried to talk but my throat was clogged with mucus, so all that came out was a nasty gargle. I cleared my throat with a hearty cough. “W-what are you doing here?”
Admiral Obern lifted an eyebrow. “I don’t know, maybe I was here to get you out of your slump.”
Despite my sorrow, I let out a sad chuckle. “I didn’t know I was in a slump.”
He shrugged. “Call it preventative measures. Anyway, I knew you’d be blaming yourself for what happened.”
“How could I not?”
Admiral Obern let out a sigh. “Listen Victor, you are not to blame. Yes, you lead the Empire to an asteroid field. Still, that doesn’t mean their deaths are your fault. The Empire would still have made a comeback. They would have started another war. They would have killed far more people.”
“They’re still going to kill people.” I said softly.
Admiral Obern nodded. “Yes they are. I’m going to stop that and I’m actually on my way to a certain military operation that is going to accomplish that fact. Considering everything that happened, I figured that getting some revenge would be good for you.”
Sam poked his head out of the kitchen. “That deal go for me too? Cause I would love to do it.” 
I chuckled and Admiral Obern joined in. He poked a thumb towards Sam’s general direction. “Keep that guy around. He may be disrespectful, but he’s got spunk and the touch of laughter that everyone needs to keep a sound mind.”
I nodded. “He’s a great friend. I’m very lucky to have him.”
Admiral Obern turned towards me. “So, have you decided?”
I started to say something, but I hesitated. I wanted revenge, that was for sure. Yet, I wasn’t completely sure I could. “Why? Why would you choose me?” I looked down at my hands helplessly. “I barely managed to pilot a ship in combat situations, I don’t think I could possibly fight.”
He sighed and stared up at the ceiling. “Do you know what I see in you? I see hope. You are a good person Tony, a caring person. It is hard for a person like you to go to war, to end the lives of fellow humans. But you must remember the lives of those you protect by doing so, of the lives that have ended because we weren’t able to fight. Remember those that have died, in order for you to protect those that are still alive. Keep that in your heart, and I believe you will find the strength you need.”
Sam plopped down on the chair next to Admiral Obern, taking a bite of his sandwich as he did so. “Great speech,” he mumbled through a mouthful of bread. “A little corny for my taste though.” He swallowed before turning to me. “Basically, stop wimping out. You scared of dying? Scared of killing more? Well, more people are going to die before this is over. Do you want it to be the people that have murdered Anna and thousands of innocent people? Or do you want it to be the ones that are willing to stand up and fight for what they believe in?”
I shook my head and gave a little chuckle. “I guess you guys both went to the same store, because your pep talks sound like the same thing.” I looked up at them. “Yeah, I’ll do it.”
“Yes!” Sam pumped his fist  in the air before pausing. He turned towards Admiral Obern. “Sooo, does this mean we have a get out of jail free card?”
Admiral Obern laughed. “Yes, yes it does.”

***

It turns out, the only way for us to be absolved of our crimes was to re-enlist. There was a loophole that any crimes could be forgiven whenever you enlisted, but typically murderers weren’t recruited. It was up to the recruiter’s best judgment about whether the person should be qualified for the military life. Luckily, we had Admiral Obern backing us up so our enlistment went off without a hitch.
We were taken aboard a battleship, Admiral Obern’s flagship, for the recruiting process. Shortly after we were aboard, it jumped to hyperspace. Once we were done with the legal mumbo jumbo,  we were ordered to get dressed into our military fatigues. We kept the same rank we had before we retired from the military, a fact that I was glad for.
Once we were dressed, Admiral Obern came down take us to the bridge. While we walked, he started talking. “Let me go ahead and tell both of you a little bit more about your assignment. Victor is going to be in command of a stealth ship, one similar to the one we sold you, with a few more bells and whistles. Sam, you’ll be joining him as his sensors officer and co-pilot. You’ll have some engineers and weapons technicians assigned to you, so that all you’ll have to do is worry about the flying. You don’t have to touch a weapon if you don’t want to.”
I gave him a grateful nod.“Thanks Admiral.”
Sam smiled as well. “It’s basically what we were doing before, just with a few extra people. At least we won’t have to adjust much.”
Admiral Obern cleared his throat before moving on. “We are currently en-route to a secret military facility. It was there that the prototype ship you were sold, as well as the one you’ll be piloting, was developed. They’ve had a couple different breakthroughs in projects, but none of their plans have been approved for large-scale deployment. The military simply hasn’t had the funding. Some of our other projects located here have similarly been held back due to the costs.”
“Congress has just recently approved of a much bigger budget for the military, one that we have been trying to get approved for half a year. Due to this, most of those projects are finally being finished.”
“As a matter of fact, the biggest project we’ve been working on is only possible due to your help, Victor.”
I raised my eyebrow at that. “What do you mean by that?”
Admiral Obern started to say something before shaking his head. “Let me ask you this, have you ever thought of how the Empire was able to make those dreadnoughts? The estimated costs put each one at just over 3 trillion credits and the Empire managed to build three of them at the same time.”
I shook my head. “I never really thought about it honestly.”
Sam chuckled. “I believe he was more concerned with how to blow it up than how it was built. I’ve looked into it myself, some pretty interesting documentaries are out about it.”
Admiral Obern nodded in acknowledgement. “Than I hope you can back me up then. The Empire had control of practically the entire commercial sector. If they wanted something done, it got done. Still, the Empire actually went into a recession from the cost of building those dreadnoughts. Even though we have the schematics for building a dreadnought, we don’t dare try and build one. They are simply too draining on our resources to make it a feasible course of action.”
He punched in a code onto a keypad next to the elevator. “Of those three dreadnoughts the Empire fielded, one was ripped apart by our capital ships. Another was shredded by our fighters. The last one had its bridge destroyed when you launched your missiles at it. The dreadnought you destroyed was in remarkably good condition.”
The elevator doors opened. Two technicians were in the elevator chatting, but they immediately stopped and saluted. “At ease men.” They relaxed as he pushed one of the buttons, causing the elevator to start heading upwards. 
He turned back towards me, intent on finishing our conversation. “We had to send our marines into the ship in order to truly capture it, and some of the crew were able to sabotage parts of the weapons and engines before we could get to them. Still, that dreadnought is the largest ship we managed to seize. It doesn’t work though, thanks to those Imperial scums. We have its blueprints though, so fixing it shouldn’t be too much of an issue.”
I wasn’t quite sure I liked were this was going. “What are you trying to say admiral.”
Admiral Obern grinned. “Well you see, I’ve pulled quite a few strings for you over the years. You didn’t think it was just because you managed to kill the Emperor did you? Oh no, it was because you are the one we all have to thank for project Behemoth.”
The doors for the elevator opened, revealing the bridge. We had dropped out of hyperspace already. On the viewscreen was the image of a massive ship docked to a large space station. At the sight of the ship I started to hyperventilate.
Admiral Obern didn’t notice it, a proud grin plastered on his face as he stared out the window. “We couldn’t possibly build a dreadnought with our financial resources. As for repairing a dreadnought, maybe upgrading it here or there, that is something well within our means.”
Sam leaned over to me. “You okay? You’re looking a little pale.”
“I’m fine.” I gasped out. The world was starting to look a little fuzzy, even though I was breathing as fast as I could. “I just need some air.” The world suddenly turned black. I felt my body hit the ground and then, nothing.

Fleet Admiral Roth checked out the numbers before nodding. “If they can finish in time, this will be a great lineup.”
Admiral Gath shook his head. “With all due respect, I’m not so sure Fleet Admiral. You are sending in two hundred experimental stealth ships to attack a mobile shipyard and an Imperial fleet, all without backup.”
Roth frowned as he heard Gath’s opinion. “The stealth ships have been tested extensively, they will not fail. I’ve already arranged for backup as well. While Admiral Obern’s fleet has already been re-assigned to their patrols, a major portion of the Navy now patrol the frontier. When we initiate our attack, they will have reinforcements within four hours.
Gath rolled his eyes. “Their firepower isn’t sufficient to take down a shipyard though. They can’t possibly penetrate through the shields and armor of that monster while holding off an Imperial Armada, it just can’t be done! Not only that, but the Empire already figured out we were coming the last time, what is to stop them from doing that again?”
Roth shook his head. “The stealth ships are all equipped with EMP cannons, something that the Empire has no defense against. They’ll have a technological edge over the Empire with weapons they can’t block and ships they can’t detect. The only reason they detected us last time was because a large portion of our fleet disappeared from their patrols. This time, we’re sending in a small commando unit. They won’t detect us this time. Not only that, but we’ll also have the Behemoth.”
Admiral Gath threw up his hands. “And that’s another thing! I can’t see why we would ever resort to using an Imperial ship that should have been scuttled for parts as our secret weapon! We have no idea what kind of viruses are in that things control systems or what boobytraps are hidden inside! We are inviting our own doom by relying on that thing!”
Fleet Admiral Roth shook his head sadly. “I would have expected more from you, Admiral Gath. If you had read the reports on the Behemoth you would have already had your answers instead of jumping to conclusions. We were also worried about deadman switches and viruses when we captured the dreadnought. That is why we had our marines sweep through the entire ship inch by inch. It took us two years to do just that! While it was being searched, the computer systems for the entire ship was yanked out. We couldn’t replace it with our own though, since we didn’t have the budget to buy the necessary electronics. With the new budget though, the new systems are already on their way, along with upgraded point-defense turrets and main armaments for the ship.”
Admiral Gath seemed mollified by that reply, but he still stood firm on his beliefs. “Regardless of what you say, I still believe that we would be courting disaster by bringing that thing with us into combat.”
Fleet Admiral Roth slammed his hand down onto the table. “Enough! I do not care, at this point, what you believe or do not believe! In three weeks time, the Behemoth and the fleet of stealth ships will be under your command. Your fleet will fly out to attack the mobile shipyard and the Imperial fleet stationed there! We have probes in the system that have already confirmed their return! When you arrive, you are to prevent any of the ships from escaping by disrupting warp space! You are to deal as much damage as you can until the reinforcement fleet arrives three hours later! Do you understand Admiral Gath?!”
Admiral Gath had straightened up when Roth raised his voice. “Yes sir!”
Roth sighed and fell back into his chair. It seemed, in that moment, as though he had aged by ten years. “I picked you, from all three admirals, for a reason, Gath. You are cautious, yes, and that is good in any commander. Still, I would not like for that caution to turn to cowardice as I have seen here. You have used unorthodox strategies many times in the past, so I know I can trust you in a tight spot. As you have pointed out, we are using new technology for the first time on the battlefield and with a ship that we have taken from the enemy. You will need to be ready for anything. Admiral Obern is a fine commander, but he does not function well in unexpected situations. That is why he will be leading the reinforcements, an orthodox fleet for an orthodox commander. Admiral Sark will be in charge of defending us in case of another attack while I will be coordinating your attacks from here. I ask you this one thing Admiral Gath and if do not agree, you will be stripped of your command and expunged from the military. Will you carry out your orders and destroy the Empire?”
Admiral Gath saluted. “I will carry out my orders, sir.”
Fleet Admiral Roth nodded. “Good. In that case, prepare your men. You have very little time to prepare.”


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 21</h1>

I sat down at the console, preparing for the upcoming battle. Currently I was behind the seat of one of two hundred and fifty stealth corvettes that were heading towards Eden’s Belt.  Large ships, such as destroyers and battleships, often had a captain and a pilot. On smaller ships, such as cruisers and corvettes, the captain and pilot were often the same person. On larger ships there was far more duties to carry out and people to watch over. There was usually at least a few hundred people onboard on a destroyer and a battleship could easily have three times as many crew members.
For our corvette, we had a pilot, the sensors officer, navigations officer, communications officers, a weapons technician, and two engineers. Sensors, navigation, piloting, and comms were all self-explanatory roles. They’d make sure we didn’t run into anything and that we’d know what orders we were given. The weapon’s technician would make sure our weapons were working and would also be in charge of firing them, while the engineers would keep the rest of the ship together. 
Speaking of weapons, it had the same layout as our old ship, mostly because it was our ship. The military had taken it into custody when we were arrested, but Admiral Obern had gotten it released. Then he had it shipped here and updated with the latest military tech. It was primarily the capacitor on the EMP, some better stealth tech, sensors, and a laser communications array.  It had the EMP cannon and plasma sprayer mounted on the front with two recessed ballistic turrets on the side. The sprayer and EMP was a deadly combination, one I didn’t want to be on the wrong side of.
I had already rearranged the controls to my favorite layout in the training sessions before this. Still, fiddling with them helped calm my nerves. It was an old habit from my days as a fighter pilot. The navigation officer spoke up. “Captain, we’ll be exiting warp space in five minutes.”
I nodded. “Understood navigation. Comms, make the announcement to the crew. Everyone is to be at their stations in three minutes.”
After I had fainted on the bridge of the flagship, I’d been checked out by the doctor. I was told that it was simply stress and anxiety that caused it. Admiral Obern had felt awful. He said that he should have known seeing the dreadnought would bring up old feelings. I told it was no big deal and to let it go.
It took a while to get over seeing that awful ship, a week to be precise. In order to adapt, I spent my time staring out the viewscreen in my cabin as the dreadnought, ahem, the behemoth, was being worked on. The new name actually helped a lot. It made me realize that it was a different ship than the one I had destroyed.
After I stopped hyperventilating when I saw the behemoth, I was given a stealth corvette, my crew, and some time to put it through its paces. I wasn’t very close with the crew, except for Sam of course, but we worked well enough together. 
Time had flown by while we practiced. It felt like only one day, but it had already been two weeks. We were finally going to destroy the Empire.
I watched eagerly as the timer ticked down. When it reached zero, we exited warpspace. In a well-practiced maneuver, I activated the stealth system less than a second after we entered normal space. 
All around us the other corvettes exited warpspace, their ships disappearing from our navigation shortly afterwards. Unfortunately, in order to have complete stealth, the IFF (Identify-Friend-Foe) broadcast was disabled. We’d turn it on once we engaged, but it would give away the fact that Federation assets were in the system if we didn’t turn it off.
Right now, we were on the outskirts of Eden’s Belt. The behemoth was two light years away, a necessity due to its massive size. The second it entered the system, the behemoth would have lit up every sensor in the area. 
While we would sneak up on the Empire in our stealth corvettes, the behemoth would be waiting for the right time to strike. It was already synced with our navigation data, so Admiral Gath would know when to arrive. The behemoth could be here in less than four seconds, so it wasn’t as dangerous as it felt.
A tight beam laser hit our shield. It was the LCA (laser communications array) that the Navy used in stealth situations. The laser was impossible to detect at short range. The communications officer relayed the order. “Captain, we are to enter deeper into the system and target the mobile shipyard with our EMP cannons. At exactly 1430, we are to fire on our target.”
I nodded. “Communicate our acceptance of the order. Navigation, give me a heading.” Once the path was highlighted on my HUD, I activated the main engine. The ship started forward, the stealth cowling around the engines absorbing any of the heat that radiated from the thrust.
We accelerated at tremendous speeds, a risk that I took because the only way we could be detected was if a ship was right behind us. Since all the Imperial assets were in front of us, I didn’t have to worry.
Once we passed the outermost planet in the system, I cut thrusters and began to coast instead. As we got closer and closer to our target, I started firing the thrusters in short burst. A continuous burn would be more efficient, but it would also be more likely to be picked up. The short burst would probably be put down as flares of background radiation.
The corvette sailed past multiple Imperial battleships and destroyers, the viewscreen showing us magnified images of the terrifying ships. The entire bridge became quiet as a grave, the unreasonable fear that they could somehow hear us silencing everyone. I had to navigate us around a ship that blocked our path more than once, making for some tense moments. We even had to dodge a few asteroids too.
Within five hours of arriving in the system, we reached our destination. Everyone was tense, so I ordered the entire crew to take a lunch break. I stayed on the bridge though, making sure our velocity was fine. It took some fine tuning with the thrusters, but I managed to get the corvette to a zero-velocity relative to our target.
The plan was for the behemoth to warp into the system and use a system-wide warp disruptor so that nothing could leave as soon as it arrived. At the same time, we would all fire our EMPs at the mobile shipyard. That much firepower should take out the shipyard’s shields, making it vulnerable to the behemoths guns. And boy did that thing have guns. 
It would fire everything it had on one side of the shipyard, hopefully demolishing it with one broadside. At the same time, our corvettes would be blasting all the ships around us with EMPs, shorting out shields and firing ballistic rounds at everything. Our number one targets were the battleships, though destroyers and smaller support vessels were viable as well. Basically, we were going to cause as much chaos as possible.
The behemoth would soak up as much damage as it could, hopefully attracting all the attention due to its enormous size. All the while, a fleet of Federation ships would be on its way. They would drop out of warpspace over four hours away from the asteroid belt where all the action would be taking place. The warp disruptor would still be active, after all.
As I ran through the plan mentally, I kept a careful eye on the clock. I took a break once everyone came back from lunch. I ate a quick sandwich, not wanting to be gone for too long just in case something went wrong. This was the thing I hated most about space battles. The long wait.
I checked the time. 1427. Gulping down the last bite of my sandwich, I headed for the bridge. Once there, I checked the scans. Nothing had changed. I took back my pilot chair from sam. I watched in eager anticipation as the timer slowly ticked down.
At exactly 14:29:57, the behemoth warped into the system. It appeared in front of the viewscreen, impossible to miss. A hulking monster made of metal, completely covering the screen. I didn’t have a chance to admire or shrink in fear from it.
My part in this fight was already here.
I triggered the EMP cannon, a pulse of electric-blue light surging forward from my ship.
As the pulse raced forward, traveling at just below the speed of light, I activated the engines. “Everyone, man your battlestations! We are officially in the fight!”


<h1 class = "chapter-title">Chapter 22</h1>

His name was Dalton Everton. Born on Corinth, a backwater world of the Empire, one of the slums. Still, his intelligence had been picked up on in school. At the age of 15 he was recruited into the Imperial Armada, starting off as a private. By the time the war had rolled around, he’d became the executive officer of a supply frigate.
After several succcessful campaigns, he’d been promoted to be the captain of his own destroyer. He’d been part of Admiral Belthos attack on the Federation, which was how he had ended up being apart of the fleet that didn’t surrender when the Emperor was killed. 
Currently, he was in charge of protecting the mobile shipyard. He was honored that he was considered worthy of protecting the most vulnerable asset of the Empire. He was on the bridge, monitoring the scans of the surrounding space.
As he was monitoring the scans, a giant red dot appeared on the monitor. Before he could react, a huge pulse of energy shot forward to hit the mobile shipyard. Panicked now, he did the nly thing he could do. “Everyone, man your stations! We are currently under attack,” He yelled over the comm systems.
There was a flash of eletric blue light through the screen and alarms started to go off as the shields disappeared. He saw the bright orange glow of plasma right before it enveloped the front of the destroyer. The bridge turned into molten metal, the only thing left of Dalton Everton was ashes.

***

Our IFF turned online, just as all the other stealth corvettes did. I picked a battleship closest to us, using the thrusters to angle towards it. The EMP cannon was charging, but it would be ready in ten seconds. The behemoth fired its plasma cannons, railguns, and lasers. Missiles started streaming out of the behemoth towards nearby enemy ships. The shield of the mobile shipyard flickered before vanishing as numerous EMPs hit it.
I saw the outside of the shipyard glow red from the heat of lasers before it suddenly exploded. I wasn’t sure if the heat had caused it or the ballistic rounds had finally impacted. Plasma started to bury itself through the armor of the shipyard, vaporizing the rock that was in its way. 
Multiple Imperial warships lit their engines, moving towards the giant that stood in its midst. The battleships that I was focusing on started towards the action. I closed into range, the weapon technician firing the EMP cannon and the ballistic turrets. The electric-blue pulse hit the battleship, its shield suddenly going down. As they went down, the ballistic rounds smashed into the side of the battleship. There was an explosion as the rounds hit something critical. The battleships weapons started firing in all directions, even as air and flames leaked from the gash in its side.
My ship flew by it, dodging a few plasma bolts that navigation highlighted for me. I fired the thrusters, sending the corvette in a banking turn back towards the battleship. As we got closer to the battleship, I saw that its shields were back online. It had redundant shields after all, but it must have taken a couple seconds to get them active. The EMP cannon was ready. The weapon technician fired again, wiping out their shields. Three plasma bolts hit our shields, causing them to dip down to ninety-one percent.
 The plasma thrower activated, causing a cone of star-hot plasma to gush forth from the nose of the corvette. The plasma hit the front part of the battleship, melting straight through the unprotected metal hull of the battleship, reducing the entire front half of the ship into molten metal. An explosion caused the rear half to completely shatter.
The whole time I was piloting, navigation was giving me several different courses in order to accomplish different objectives. Sensors was feeding me data on enemy ships and enemy fire nearby, along with asteroids that were in the way. Absorbing that much information may have been hard for a rookie, but I had learned some time ago to accomplish the task effortlessly. Anyone that didn’t know how to do the same had already died in the war.
With our target destroyed, I moved on to other targets. We headed for a destroyer this time. Apparently, news that invisible ships were attacking had spread. The space around the destroyer was thick with plasma bolts. It was a good tactic for at least locating a stealth ship. If we didn’t have shields, it may have even destroyed a stealth ship. Still, it wasn’t enough.
I came roaring in, ready to wipe out the destroyer. A plasma bolt impacted the shields, bringing it down to ninety-six percent, while also alerting the destroyer to the invisible hunter that was gunning for it. The EMP fired, causing the destroyer’s shields to vanish. At the same time, a laser impacted my shields. Seventy-six percent. The ballistic turrets, their barrels tracking the destroyer with the help of their motorized mount.
Multiple ballistic rounds slammed into the back of the destroyer, causing one of the engines to blow up. The explosion caused a chain reaction, even more explosions going off shortly after.
I hunted down two more destroyers before they finally wised up. Their ships got into squads, with battleships, destroyers, and frigates. Smaller ships, such as corvettes and fighters, were being launched from a couple different carriers that had been hiding inside the asteroid belt.
With them in formation, it was very hard to sneak up on them. The total kill count now was 3 destroyers and 1 battleship. The shields were at twenty-nine percent, random plasma bolts and lasers having taken their toll. Luckily, plasma balls required an ion trail from a ship’s engines in order to lock on to a target. Because of our stealth modifications, there wasn’t enough of an ion trail for it to lock on to. Lasers and plasma turrets were only point-defense for big ships like these. They also had missiles and railguns, but they couldn’t lock on to a target.
As of right now, I had to back off in order to let my shields regenerate. While I was waiting, I decided to look at the overall situation. The mobile shipyard was a sitting duck, the massive barrage from the behemoth was doing obvious damage. Huge chunks of rock were floating away from the shipyard, so something must be going right for them. I went ahead and checked the casualties.
So far we were lucky. Only nine ships were destroyed out of two hundred and fifty. The lack of casualties was due to the fact that eighty percent of all the enemy ships were converging on the behemoth. While it was still alive, we were safe from being swarmed by massive amounts of ships. Still, the twenty percent left over was looking for us, and it was still enough to give me a headache.

***

Admiral Belthos was enjoying a nice cup of tea when alarms started going off. Setting down his cup, he raced towards the bridge. His quarters were only a few feet away, a safety precaution taken so that he wouldn’t be too far away to intervene in the case of an emergency.
“Report,” he demanded as he ran onto the bridge.
The captain of the armored Battleship Kraken saluted him. “Sir, sensors have just picked up a massive ship that warped in next to the shipyard. The ship has already used a system wide disruptor, nothing can warp in or out.”
Admiral Belthos nodded grimly. “The Federation has made its move I see. Order all our ships to attack that ship. Sensors, get a visual of the ship and display it on screen. Is there any other ships spotted? I doubt that the Federation would have dared to send a single ship, no matter how large, to attack our fleet.”
The captain shook his head. “No sir, there are no other reports. Our scanners aren’t picking up anything either. No additional reinforcements could possibly warp in now because of the disruptor The ship appears to be by itself.”
“Good. Keep me updated captain.” Admiral Belthos moved towards his chair, sitting down on it. A single, giant ship by itself in an enemy system. He could only think of one possibility, though he didn’t know how they had pulled it off. He already knew that the Federation could appear within three hour. If the ship was actually a drone, with multiple reactors dedicated to only shields, then this might be a long day. The ship would keep them from jumping long enough for the Federation warships to get here. In order to stop that from happening, they needed to destroy that ship.
“Sir,” the sensors officer said. “I have a visual. Putting it on screen.”
Admiral Belthos turned to look before letting out a gasp. “It cannot be!” Staring directly at him was one of the Empire’s dreadnoughts, a fleet killer built to protect the throneworld while the fleet was campaigning. “Sensors, what is the dreadnought doing?!”
The sensors officer, kept her cool, replying back to the flustered Admiral Belthos with an even tone. “The dreadnought is currently firing on the mobile shipyard sir.”
He started muttering to himself. “How could this be possible? Did they build one of their own? No, they couldn’t possibly do it. Their military doesn’t have the resources. Perhaps they scrounged together one from the remnants of the ones they destroyed? Yes, that must be it! How dare they desecrate Imperial warships! Using it for their own goals!”
“Admiral!” The captain interrupted Admiral Belthos angry mutterings. “There are reports of invisible ships coming in sir! The reports state that they have some sort of weapon that can knock out shields, along with plasma and ballistic weapons! They are currently attacking battleships and destroyers, while ignoring frigates and corvettes. None of our carriers have yet revealed themselves yet. Should we launch fighters?”
Admiral Belthos stood up. This was far more serious than he first thought. Invisible ships combined with the massive dreadnought posed a very serious risk. He paced for a few seconds before coming up with an idea. “Tell the fleet to get into squadrons. Have each battleship be grouped with two destroyers and any support vessels you have. Order them to constantly fire their weapons, cover the areas around them in order to detect the stealth ships. Have the carriers begin launching fighters in twenty minutes. I want an analysis of these ghosts before we send our fighters in blind.”
***

I was waiting for the shields to recharge when the carriers revealed themselves. Over three hundred fighters were spreading throughout space, released from the five carriers that moved out from the asteroid field. When the shields reached a hundred percent, I activated the engines. We headed towards the carriers, a few wings of fighters in the way. A total of fifty ships. Activating the EMP cannon, I unleashed a pulse of electromagnetic energy, the electric-blue light washing over the fighter squadrons in our path.
The fighters drifted in space, no longer able to correct their path. Their engines shorted out, their weapons were fried, and their life support was destroyed. If no one came to rescue them, they would run out of air and die within a half hour. Still, that wasn’t my problem.
I flew past the fighters, heading towards the more vulnerable carrier. I moved into a corkscrew, anticipating the sudden burst of plasma fire heading towards the origin of the EMP.  The carrier didn’t have any main armaments, but it did have many point-defense turrets. Hundreds of plasma bolts filled the space around it after the first barrage missed. By the time I got in range of the carrier, the shields had already went down to forty percent.
The EMP cannon let out an electric-blue pulse of magnetically charged electrons, short circuiting the carriers shields. The point-defense turrets stopped firing as well, probably damaged from the EMP. I didn’t want to take the risk, so I told the weapons technician to fire the plasma thrower. The plasma melted through the ship, causing plumes of unidentified gases to jet out into space. The carrier didn’t explode, but it was already as good as destroyed.
I flew back out into space, waiting for my shields to recharge. These Imperial ships were so vulnerable, they didn’t have any way to protect themselves. It was just like a knight that wore armor. The only way to destroy the armor was by bashing at it repeatedly with swords. The one who would win was the one that was physically stronger and had the better equipment. On the other hand, that metal armor was useless if someone used a stun gun on you. While you were paralyzed, they could easily stick a knife in your throat.
It was the same in this case. Normally, battles between capital ships came down to who had the better shielding, reactors, and weapons. They would exchange multiple blows from plasma cannons, lasers, and railguns. Now, we had a way to disable the shields. While the armor of a battleship was tough, it still wasn’t able to handle star-hot plasma or metal slugs traveling at a tenth of light speed.
Still, EMP cannons did have their disadvantages. They were short range, meaning that in order to use it, the two conflicting ships would need to get close to each other. For the slow battleships and dreadnoughts, that posed a problem. That design meant that smaller, faster ships were needed in order to close that gap quicker. At the same time, those smaller ships would always have less shields than their bigger counterparts. A single barrage from a destroyer could easily annihilate a frigate or corvette before they could get in range.
All of this meant that the only type of ship that EMP cannons could be practically useful on was a small stealth ship, just like the one we were on. If the range for the EMP cannons could be increased, all of this would change. For now, the stealth corvettes were the only ships that could logically be equipped with EMP cannons. They just weren’t suited for any vessels at the moment.
I took a moment to see how the rest of the battles were going. Since the Imperial warships had started grouping up, another twelve of our ships had been destroyed. A total of twenty one losses. The Imperials, on the other hand, had taken quite a blow. I could see close to seventy battleships and twenty destroyers had been destroyed.
There were plenty of frigates and corvettes in the Imperial mix. They weren’t much good, a single EMP taking them out of the fight. Without their redundant shield systems, they were useless. At the very least, it provided more weapons for the imperials to shoot us down.
As I looked over at the shipyard, I saw multiple explosions going off. The behemoth was moving away from it, the main armaments swiveling towards the battleships and destroyers that were attempting to kill it.
The behemoth had lost a good portion of its shields. It wasn’t enough to take it down though, not by a longshot. Now, all that firepower was being turned on the Imperials.
I checked the shields. Ninety two percent. With a swipe of my finger, I activated the engines. Time to get back into the action.

***

Admira Gath stood on the bridge of the behemoth. What a childish name for such a devastating machine of war. So far, everything was going according to Fleet Admiral Roth’s plans. They had already destroyed the mobile shipyard and were now moving onto the enemy ships.
“Concentrate missile fire on the battleships. Use plasma balls on the destroyers and keep our lasers and plasma turrets on the battleships. Wear them down so that the missiles can penetrate their defenses,” He ordered the bridge crew.
“Yes sir,” they said in response. There were over thirty different people on the bridge crew a necessity due to how large the ship was. Most of them were merely responsible for coordinating the various departments on the ship and making sure his order were relayed. Gath watched as one of the battleships on his screen lost their shields from a missile impacting them. A laser cut a hole in their side before a second missile blew a massive crater in the battleship.
The behemoth was doing massive damage, that much was for certain. Still, his shields were also taking a major pounding. They were already at 50%, a startling low number for such a massive ship. It was going to be a close call if they were going to survive this.
The only good news he had was that Fleet Admiral Roth was right, much to his chagrin. The Empire didn’t have anything that could take the behemoth down, no deadman switches had been activated even though it was almost two hours into the fight.

***

Admiral Belthos had a hologram of the battle in front of him, watching as it constantly updated. Some of the enemy ships were being destroyed, but he was taking far too many losses. He saw his shipyard blow up, as well as any of his future plans. Without that shipyard, he wouldn’t have any way to repair his ships or make new ones. The Empire would vanish. Still, he wasn’t going down without a fight.
The federation dreadnought was frustratingly hard to kill, but it would take some time. If the Emperor hadn’t been paranoid, he may have been able to use some of the remote detonation viruses inside the reactor controls of their ship. Unfortunately, the Emperor had required that no remote detonations be installed on any dreadnoughts, stating that if they lost one, it would be the end of the Empire anyways. That, and he was afraid that someone that disagreed with his heavy handed ways would get their hands on the detonation codes.
He frowned as he tried to think of a way to counteract the stealth ships that were doing so much damage. Finally, he had something. “Tell the battleships to launch their nukes. Detonate them when they get beyond the blast radius. This should keep those invisible ships at bay for a while longer.”

***

Nukes are a very special existence in space combat. While some ships used missiles in combat, they were not often used because of limited munitions. Missiles were very fast though, making them perfect against fighters. However, nukes were not missiles. They were much slower and larger than a missle. The necessary equipment for a fission reaction made them too slow to properly be called a missle.
A nuke wouldn’t even detonate if it was shot, simply turning into radioactive debris instead. It had been proven time and time again that a nuke would just become a target for the point-defense of the enemy. Thus, nukes were used only for orbital bombardment of ground targets.
However, where there’s a will, there's a way. Clever tacticians are not limited to commonly accepted practices. They use whatever they can in order to gain an advantage in the battlefield.

***

I was closing in on a battleship with two destroyers and five frigates as an escort when it happened. Ten missiles left the ships, shooting out in all directions. I hadn’t got really close yet, so I banked away. I wasn't quite sure why they fired missiles, their tracking algorithms couldn’t possibly find a stealth ship. Still, I hadn’t survived the war by believing I was invincible.
I was watching through the sensors to try and determine what they were trying to accomplish. I had been afraid that it was a missile that could track stealth ships somehow, but none of the missiles were heading towards me. Suddenly, the sensor data went blank. An alarm started to go off as well.
“We’ve lost shields,” one of the weapons technicians yelled.
I turned to Sam. “What’s going on Sensors?”
“I don’t know,” Sam said as he started tweaking the controls. He pulled up a readout and nodded. “We were hit by an EMP. I’m rebooting the sensors now.”
The weapons technician ran off the bridge. “I’ll replace some of the motherboards for the shield projectors. The EMP will have shorted them out. We should have shields back online within ten minutes.”
I let out a sigh of relief before suddenly sitting up. “Do we still have stealth!”
“Yes sir.” One of the officers told me. “Our stealth is mostly provided by our armor plating and cowls. Without our shields though, we won’t be able to take a hit.”
“Sensor are back online.” As Sam said that, the sensor data started streaming. “It looks as though those missiles were nukes. We weren’t the only ones that were hit by an EMP though. It looks like we lost over seventy ships that were caught in the explosion. Another ten lost their shields and were hit.”
I activated the engines and headed towards empty space, away from all the enemy ships. Before I could make it, the ship rocked from an explosion. A plasma bot impacted the ship, ripping a hole through the unprotected hull. Alarms went off as parts of the ship lost atmosphere.
“Shut down the alarms! Technicians, seal the breach! Everyone, brace for acceleration,” as I yelled I started to access the thrust controls. I brought them to full power, sending the ship in a sideways motion. The venting atmosphere gave away our position, as evidenced by the plasma bolts that were heading our way.
I pushed the engine to the max, attempting to get out of range as I used the thrusters to avoid some of the plasma bolts that were flying at us. We took two shots before managing to get away. One sheared off a portion of the top armor while another ripped off a ballistic turret.
The frigates were chasing us down while firing their plasma turrets, though they were slightly slower than us. The two destroyer and the battleship were also attempting to chase us down, but they were too slow to catch up.
All of a sudden, two of the frigates lost power as a third was enveloped in plasma. According to the IFF, it was another stealth corvette. The two remaining frigates slowed down to regroup with the destroyers and battleships, their plasma turrets attempting to find the stealth corvette attacking them.
With the loss of pursuers, I was able to slow down and give the technicians a chance to repair the hulls. Once the breaches were sealed, we were once again undetected and stealthy, though not as good as before. I’d have to be careful.
Until our shields were back online, I wasn’t going to risk being shot at again. I remained in deep space, waiting for them to be repaired. It took even longer than the technician thought, with over fifteen minutes going by before the shields were restored.
When he came to the control room, I realized why it took so long. One of his hands was badly burnt, a result of molten metal falling down on his hand as he was trying to patch one of the holes in our ship. It was a miracle that he had even go the shields up and running.
I took a deep, shuddering breath as I realized what this meant. Sam looked over at me, concern written all over his face. “You gonna be okay Tony,” he asked me in a quiet voice.
I didn’t trust myself to answer so I just nodded. Sam nodded back in return before turning back to his console. I activated the weapons, ready to do my part in this fight.
The behemoth was taking a lot of fire its shields were running very low. The fight had been going on for close to two hours now. Most of that time having been taken up by us waiting for our shields to repair.
Once our shields were back online, we had to wait another twenty minutes before they were at a hundred percent.
I started in on a strafing run on a group of enemy ships. I fired the EMP and the plasma thrower simultaneously at a battleship before immediately fleeing. I didn’t have the courage to stick around and my hands were shaking from imagining how many people had died from that one attack. I wasn’t a coward though, there was a good reason I couldn’t continue the attack run.
The EMP cannon still had to recharge, another downside to the otherwise powerful weapon. It was excellent against lone ships, not so good against groups. I lost over fifty percent of my shields from the pair of destroyers that were escorting it, their plasma bolts chasing after me as I escaped. The mission was accomplished though, the battleship now missing a large portion of its front due to the attack.
This was why we had started losing more ships. While we could eliminate one target fairly easily, multiple ships meant that we would become vulnerable to counter attack as our weapons recharged. As it stood now, the two-hundred and fifty ships had been reduced to one-hundred and sixteen. That meant that we had lost one hundred and thirty four ships already.
We had been able to take out Imperial ships quite rapidly when we first appeared, but that had slowed down  as they adapted to our attack runs. We were taking more damage due to their improving tactics. This, in turn, led to longer wait times as the shields recharged in between attacks.
The behemoth had run out of shields three and a half hours into the attack. Plasma balls and lasers carving deeper into its side. I was worried that the Imperials would jump out of the system once the behemoth was destroyed. At least we had taken out the shipyard, but who knew if they had anymore. The behemoth couldn’t last longer than a few more seconds now that its shields were down. I saw its shields flicker back on and absorb the next volley of plasma balls. After a few dozen hits, they collapsed again.
Due to its enormous reactors, they must be able to recharge the shields rapidly in order to keep the behemoth alive for a few minutes longer. It wasn’t without cost though. The behemoth was no longer firing its weapons. The power that should have gone to the weapons was now going to the shields. The shield would flicker into appearance every few seconds before vanishing under the continuous firepower.
It had been two hours and forty-nine minutes since the behemoth had warped into the system. Once the behemoth was gone, the rest of the Empire’s ships would focus on the stealth ships. We had already suffered almost fifty-four percent casualties, and we were only fighting a little over a quarter of the Empire’s ships. Originally it was only a fifth, but they had to bring in more ships as they started taking casualties. The other ships were trying to destroy the warp disruptor so they could flee.
Put quite simply, we were on our last legs. The stealth ships had caught the Imperials off guard and allowed us to inflict a lot of casualties. Even if the Imperials did manage to escape, we had managed to destroy close to seventeen percent of their capital ships. That was an impressive blow that they may not be able to handle.
With my shields recharged, I headed towards the two destroyers that had been protecting the battleship I’d taken out. They were heading towards another group of ships, intending to join up. I wouldn’t give them the chance.
Swooping in, I knocked out the shields for the destroyer on the left. Multiple ballistic rounds finished the job, holes appearing down the line of the ship’s hull. The destroyer on the right attempted to hit me, but I turned upwards, leaving the destroyer underneath me. I did a one-eighty, swooping down on it. An EMP-plasma thrower combination finished it off.
As time went on, I was falling into old habits. Killing wasn’t something I was shaken up about anymore, I didn’t have time to think. It wasn’t until the stops for our shields to recharge that the reality of what I was doing finally kicked in. Still, I was able to ignore what little remained of conscience as time went on. War was, unfortunately, a great teacher in that regard.
As the destroyer exploded behind me, I heard Sam whooping and hollering. The sudden noise caused me to jerk, the ship swerving towards an asteroid I’d been flying by. I steadied the ship before turning and glaring at Sam. “I am trying to fly a ship! Don’t startle me like that!”
Sam chuckled. “Well, I don’t think you’ll do much better. Look at the scans from the Oort cloud.”
I did as he said. The scans showed a massive amount of ship had warped into the system. Their IFF signal proved that they were our reinforcements. The time was 1656, two hours and fifty-six minutes since the behemoth had warped into the system. I started cheering. The Empire was finished!

***

Admiral Belthos stared at the screen, the icons representing the Federations reinforcements seeming to mock him. He had already received reports from his spies that the Federation was on their way, but he could do nothing about it. Not with the warp disruptor active.
Their total losses was grave, with a loss of close to thirteen percent of his fleet, eleven percent of which was capital ships. The Federation already outnumbered them and without those capital ships to take the punishment, they would be at a severe disadvantage.
The current projections weren’t good. They had a ninety-three percent chance of losing. If they gave up fighting and fled, there was a seventy-four percent chance of a quarter of his fleet escaping.
It was impossible odds. All of his plans to restore the Empire had dissolved. He had underestimated the technology of the Federation, blinded by the superiority that they’d long held over the Federation. Now, that very superiority haad become their downfall. His arrogance was his downfall.
“Sir, an Admiral Obern is hailing us,” the comms officer stated..
Admiral Belthos nodded slowly. “I will take the call in my quarters. Tell him to hold for a few moments.” The comms officer started talking as Admiral Belthos strolled down the hallway. When he arrived, there was a blinking light on his consol that he pushed. The image of Admiral Obern appeared in front of him.
Admiral Obern stared at him. “Admiral Belthos, you have lost.”
Belthos ignored Obern, getting out a glass of wine. Pouring himself a cup, he slowly swirled it around before taking a sip. Placing it down on his desk, he looked up. “What did you call for, Admiral Obern? What do you want?”
Admiral Obern sighed. “We both know that the Empire is finished. You can’t escape. Even if you destroy the behemoth, we already have our own warp disruptors activated. Surrender, Admiral Belthos. I do not want to have more people die for an outcome we already know is going to happen.”
Admiral Belthos raised an eyebrow. “Really? Is that all you ask of me? What if I’m stubborn and decide to go out in a blaze of glory?”
Obern slammed a hand into a nearby console. “This is your people’s lives! Do you care nothing for humanity?! The Rathgar have wanted to invade since long before our time! If we lose so much of our fleet to you, we would be finished! With us weakened like this, the Rathgar would attempt something that I fear would cripple us.”
Belthos let out a chuckle. “This is something that you should have learned from the empire. Kill the aliens whenever you can.”
Belthos shook his head sadly. “We have peaceful relations with Caldons and we trade regularly with the Golts. We could never kill anything just because it is not human. Anyways, we digress. I did not come here to discuss foreign policies. What can I offer you, so that you will surrender peacefully?”
Admiral Belthos looked into his wine glass before downing the liquid in one gulp. He shook his head as the alcohol left a burning sensation on the back of his throat. “Give me and my men immunity from the death penalty.”
Admiral Obern thought for a second before nodding. “I can guarantee that. I won’t promise no life-imprisonment though.”
Belthos sighed before nodding. “Agreed. I’ll send out the order to the rest of the crew, along with your guarantee.”
“You do that.” 
The comms shut off, leaving Admiral Obern alone. He called the bridge and relayed his orders. After turning off the comms, he covered his face. Sobs echoed through the room as his dreams were crushed in the face of reality. It wasn’t his dreams that he truly weeped for though. It was the fact that he would never get revenge for his brother. Centurion was dead, but the men he truly blamed, those cargo haulers, would remain out there. The memories of his brother simply made him cry harder.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">Epilogue</h1>

After the Empire surrendered, life got complicated. We couldn’t exactly turn off the warp disruptor, otherwise they could escape. Instead, we had the Imperial ships launch lifeboats before sending a boarding team to capture the bridge.
It took a long time, close to three days, before it was done. We had to have additional ships loaded with marines and transport ships to keep the Imperial crews contained.
There was a lot of sentencing to be done. Admiral Belthos was given life in prison without a chance for parole. Most of the high-level officers were given life sentences as well but they had a chance for parole. The rest of the Imperials were given sentences varying between ten and fifty years based upon their station. Maybe it wasn’t what they had hoped for, but it was a lot better than dying in space.
I was relieved when I could finally jump back to the Federation. Unfortunately, the surprises weren’t finished. Shortly after arriving, Admiral Obern meet us. Apparently Congress had learned of our little stint as miners.
They had not been happy that we had been able to escape punishment by re-enlisting. Congress had forced the president to support them as they presented the course to the Supreme Court. The orders came from the president himself, there was no way for Fleet Admiral Roth or Admiral Obern to stop it. It was going straight to the judges to decide. It took three weeks during which we remained in prison except to testify.
We were honorably discharged from the military and then arrested. The sentencing was two years in prison, no chance of parole. Even though Admiral Obern couldn’t keep us from going to prison, there was one thing he was able to give to us. As a discoverer of a mineral claim that was considered to be national property, we were to be given compensation by the Federal government.
A total of one percent of the minerals mined there would be split between Sam and I, along with our families, for as long as the minerals were mined by the government. The president backed the decision and though Congress wasn’t exactly happy, they still accepted it.
Since we were in prison, we couldn’t exactly spend the money on anything. We had quite the stash by the time we got out. Almost five hundred thousand credits each to be precise.
The Federation was safe and the Empire was defeated. Not only that, but I was rich too. I wasn’t sure how the future would turn out, but I was sure it would be a happy one.

<h1 class = "chapter-title">To fellow readers!</h1>

So, I don’t know if I am going to be making a second book. It is a possibility , but I am not certain about turning this into a series. If you are from RRL, a big thank you for supporting me after I published. If you’re not, thank you for supporting me even though you don’t know me.
RRL folks, you know the drill. If you liked the book, leave a review if possible. If you hated it, leave a review and any suggestions to make it better. I read every single one! Goodbye, and I hope you enjoy yourself!

If you’re looking for a good book to read after this, I suggest Rookie Privateer by Jamie McFarlene. I absolutely adore his writing and he has a lot of books out, somewhere around 13 right now. The Freddy Anderson chronicles are a unique novel series as well that I have enjoyed far more than I should. If you like crazy inventions and hilarious pranks, I highly recommend it. Anyway, I hope you find another book that you like.
